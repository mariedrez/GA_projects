Anxiety,Coping,"We’re moving out of state and away from everyone we know on Sunday.

Last night (Friday) I found out someone I know took their own life.

I have cried, but mostly feel numb and I’m currently wide awake in the middle of the night."

Anxiety,Starting a new job anxiety,"As the title says, I’m starting a new job tomorrow and I’m super super nervous. I’ve never had a job in this field before and I also have to wake up really early like 6am because it’s an early start. Any tips for coping with the anxiety and to get a good night sleep before?? Any tips would be appreciated :)"
Anxiety,anxiety affecting studies,"Lately I've been feeling anxious for no apparent reason, as the result I've been unable to focus or even sit down to my study table. Not only studying but i can't focus on other activities too. I have a test coming up but i haven't prepared shit for it &amp; this anxiety is making it even worse. What do you guys do in situation like this? What should i do?"
Anxiety,"This is my recovery story since falling for the ""pin"" code scam and the ""camgirl"" scam last year","Last summer when I tried dating apps for the first time because I felt lonely and also because one of my friends who I now am no longer friends with because he ridiculed me over where my life is at. I don't have a job, no car and no girlfriend and he ridiculed me over it all. Him doing that on top of feeling lonely pushed me into making dumb mistakes like clicking on links you don't know and then actually adding someone who I don't know on snapchat who turned out to be a scammer all-along and giving the scammer money on their fake dating website (which I've learned is a common scam now and I now know not to fall for it again because of this and they were really phishing for my credit card info, which thankfully I did not give them, but I still fell for the scam using the last remaining amount on a visa gift card which was 10$) and then months after I fell for the ""pin"" code scam because I accepted this random person's message request on twitter and they turned out to be a scammer which I didn't know they were until after I fell for the scam too. I unknowingly did not know that you shouldn't ever share any pin codes with anyone last September and I learned this the hard way, they tried setting up accounts using my phone number on a dating app and luckily they did not succeed, I know this because the dating app company emailed me they couldn't find any accounts tied to my phone number. I unfortunately gave that twitter scammer my phone number and email too. I had no idea these people were scammers during the time, but I do now and I always wish I had common sense back then because none of this would have happened. 

However, I have lots and lots of common sense now and it's okay to ask questions if I think something doesn't feel right. I should have questioned myself last year and asked questions like this, ""what if I add this person on snapchat and it turns out they aren't who they say they are on tinder?"", ""what happens if I click on this link and they ask for personal or financial information?"" or ""what happens if I accept this random message request from someone who I clearly don't know and what rabbit hole will I be drug into?"" Common sense questions like these are questions I know now to always ask, I just wish I asked questions like these last year. I'm able to answer these questions now and I'm able to avoid adding strangers onto social media from some dating app now because I have the assumptions now that they're scammers if they want to swap to another platform because it could be for any reason and I never want to find out again and I assume now their scammers if and when they send me message requests on any social media app when I don't know them. 

These smart assumptions are going to save myself from ever getting scammed again."
Anxiety,After years wearing braces my teeth still look fucked up. I think I have been duped by my dentist and I cant stop thinking about it,"Almost 4 years later and I was supposed to be happy that my dentist keeps saying its almost over, yet Im making myself sick. I recently realized my right molars dont align at all, they look exactly like malocclusion examples you find online and they feel very unconfortable. My front teeth also look and feel bad yet when I me tioned it to my dentist he said it was fine.

I was duped by a dentist in my teens after years of braces. I ended up going through college without braces and felt terrible about it. After a couple of years of search this one dentist accepted to take over my case and I felt very confident. Until now, after almost 4 years and s lot of money Im back to square one.

I dont want to look for yet another opinion, why? To spend more years to fix thsi shit? My family doesnt even have the money for morr, this treatment was already too expensive. Yet it was all for nothing.

I cant stop thinking sbout it, I cant sleep, I have a lump in my throat all thr time. I just want to kill myself, i csnt fucking stand being ignored alll of the time by everyone. Im done"
Anxiety,Agoraphobia.,"Background : My family is toxic. I have seen both verbal and physical fights throughout my childhood. My parents were also really controlling ever since and in turn has made me an introvert. In 2019 I think my mental health just couldn't take it anymore and I had a severe panick attack. I had to be rushed to a hospital and was given oxygen there. This panick attack happened when I was outside shopping with my family.

After that panick attack going out was a nightmare for me. Even if it was like 10 blocks away. I gradually improved but never 100%. I diagnosed with agoraphobia and was given ""fludac 10"" for 3 months along with clonazepam for emergency situations (when I get too anxious). I still hate going far away from my home. Especially when going through a flyover/a really long road. Is there any way out? To take a break from my toxic family I am moving to a different city for further education but I am really scared. What if I get a panick attack there?

If anyone here has been diagnosed with agoraphobia at some point and has gotten better over time to the extent you almost never get anxious when going out please help."
Anxiety,"Woke up thinking I had to help people, but I think I’m just anxious. Thoughts?","Hi! It’s 3 in the morning and I just wanna hit this problem on its head because this has happened before.

But yeah, I just woke up about half an hour ago. When I did, my heart was racing and I felt as if I wasn’t thinking rationally. Like my mind went from “I need to put up stock over at aisle #” to “I need to help this person who is looking for an item.” Now that it’s half an hour later, I could tell I was being delusional about thinking those people/problems were there.

For further reference, I work as a stocker in a grocery store. I assume this is why I was thinking this way earlier, but I just wanted to ask y’all in case this was possibly something more serious. Personally I think it was me being anxious over how much I work over at this job, and that it’s eating into my sleep schedule. 

In which case, are there any good ways to treat this? Thanks!"
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"Low IQ?

Having a hard time?

I MISSED a ton of school during my education years, and fell behind rather quickly and I was missing so I wasn't there to get the material so was placed on an IEP. I was in normal classes it's just some of them had a para in the room. I wasn't diagnosed with anything I wasn't in where the autistic kids were. But am I intellectually impaired? Or is it my ADD. Don't you think by 25 they would've caught something if it was there?

I do have my CNA, I currently am employed at the hospital working on the med/surg floor and everyone says how good of a job I do. Am I just underestimating myself? Would missing school cause me to fall behind? Thats why my mom said they stuck me in those classes I mean some. English I was super good at, math and science I struggled a bit in. Could've been due to missing school too. I'm just really struggling, I'm 25 like I said and I only have been diagnosed with ADD. My oldest sister actually was in those classes also. She's got ADHD. Our whole family has ADD(HD). 

I just need advice here. This is my last resort. I see a therapist and she's saying it's anxiety but I'm not sure. She said I'd have to be average intellegience to pass that CNA.

I was surprised I passed my CNA boards lol. I know in HS I didn't really take highschool seriously. I didn't really study, I just hated school. But now I wish I could go back and re do it to see if I really am just being hard on myself or overthinking. My friends talked around the table one night and were talking about these guys that went to school with us that they thought were low IQ, but these guys weren't in special education classes. But I was. Are they saying the same about me? Lmao

My  Therapist said that by the way I talk, And how I was able to pass the CNA. I seem to have an average IQ and would have to have average intellegience to do that??"
Anxiety,Anyone else also have Social Anxiety to the point when you go out in public you think everyone is judging you because people keep looking at you,I get nervous and feel like I wanna cry because Im always thinking people are silently judging me
Anxiety,Travel/Flight Anxiety (but not the way you think),"Hi! I (as most people on here) struggle with anxiety. To make a long story short, I need to get on a plane in a few days and my anxiety is not handling it well. The issue is that there’s no coping strategies online that are useful to me because my anxiety has nothing to do with something bad happening to the plane. I’m a severe hypochondriac, and I’m incredibly nervous about a medical emergency happening to me when I’m on the plane, without access to medical help. This is being made worse by the fact that this is my first trip flying alone. Any advice ?"
Anxiety,My obsessive anxiety is ruining another relationship,"So I already have a general anxiety problem, I worry to much about everything in life, my girlfriend knew this and has been very understanding and supportive  of it. However recently over the past month or so I have become FAR worse and to add to it I've also become weirdly possessive of her, I'm constantly worried she's cheating on me or that she doesn't want to be with me anymore and I keep bringing up the Same conversations, ""do you still want to move in together"", ""why don't you feel the same way about me as you used to"" ""are you cheating on me?"" Etc...
and understandably this is pushing her away, I could tell that it was and she has straight up told me that It is, and I've actually caused a girl to break up with me before by being this weird stuttering anxious mess. And I'm terrified that I'm gonna lose her now because when I get in this state it's like a vicious cycle that feeds into itself, for example I'm worried that she has been losing interest in me because circumstances have caused us to have to do long distance for the moment, we've done back and forth visits for almost a year now, with months of long distance in-between and have been fine but for some reason after leaving her this last time I've become terrified that she's had enough of it and so when I ask her about this repeatedly she understandably gets tired of it, and then I see that she is getting tired of my bullshit and that only makes me worry that I'm gonna lose her more and then I try to tell her that I realize I'm pushing her away by being like this and that I'm working on it and please understand and give me time, but even the act of trying to reassure her that I'm working on it makes it worse because I'm constantly doing it because I'm constantly afraid that she's done with me and so I need constant validation that she's still wants to make us work...........sorry if none of that makes sense, such is the pain of living with anxiety. Basically I'm asking for someone to help me figure out why I suddenly turned into this crazy anxious psycho and how to fix the root problem that's causing it"
Anxiety,Scared I might have a blood clot.,"I have a visible vein next to me knee cap that has occasional pain, I’m freaking out so bad now."
Anxiety,i can’t sleep,"i’m 17f and i’ve been having trouble sleeping for the past 2 weeks due to anxiety and racing thoughts, if i do fall asleep i wake up around 2-4am and then i can’t sleep at all, other times i simply don’t sleep until 7am and then i wake up at 10. im exhausted. this year has been terrible in general and i’ve been extremely lonely, i guess i had so many pent up feelings and they all exploded this month. i also have seasonal depression in fall and it gets really bad during october especially, and then goes away in december. due to all of this i’ve been dissociating a lot and it’s terrifying, i’m scared of ""going crazy"", and i keep having panic attacks. so now because i can’t sleep, i’m anxious before bed in fear of not being able to sleep and that keeps me awake, then i have anxiety basically all day long the next day. 

i’m simply terrified and i don’t know what to do, i’ll try changing my lifestyle habits, get into sports and clubs to make friends and stuff because i lost them all because of anxiety this year, so then i at least won’t be so lonely. but this is so scary and my therapist is so full and getting a session takes months. i do have pills that she gave me but they don’t help much and leave me feeling weird so i don’t take them. my mom is also tired of all of this because she has been with me for hours every night because of my panic attacks."
Anxiety,This last assignment will destroy my future,"I've already failed 3 animation assignments due to my mental state. I went through a diabetic T1 coma due to hospital neglect resulting in a near heart attack and possible death, lost my grandma, my dog and essentially my mind. I used to be a straight 70-80 student but since then my marks have dropped to 50% and lower. I've managed to be eligible for a resubmission on one of my assignments and I passed that course. I wasn't eligible for another one as my mark was too low but still passed the course. I got my marks back for my recent and I failed, I really tried so hard. Lots of factors influenced my grade including my lecturer not bothering with giving me a proper review because it was ""too horrible"" , I'm not exaggerating here, everyone heard her say it. However I am eligible for resub on this one and I'm ganna give it my all because if I don't pass this last assignment that weighs 60% of the grade, I fail the year. The thought frightens me and I refuse to redo my second year. I don't want to go through seeing my boyfriend and my friends move forward into their last year while I'm left behind redoing it all with people I don't know. My parents will be so disappointed in me. I'll have to continue my waitressing job and work 13 hours everyday in order to get by while my boyfriend becomes even more of the successful animator he already is. My dreams will go down the drain and I'll be a nobody compared to my over accomish brother, which I practically already am. The resub is due on the 4th of November and the final assignment on the 24th. I'm so scared."
Anxiety,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’m in the smartest class in school. Every time I’m asked a question my heart starts racing and it takes me a second to collect myself, leading to a weird pause before everything I say. I’m scared of the teachers so if I’ve forgotten a homework or a book I won’t tell them so they call on me and I try to answer on the spot, which hasn’t worked out very well and has embarrassed me in front of the whole class. In one assignment which involved going up to the front of the class and speaking, I was visibly shaking and all my points went out of my head and I could barely speak; I got a very low score for that. When they call the register and say my name I get startled so I respond almost a second late which I get weird looks for. There are rumours that I’m in the wrong class or I’m really stupid and just got there because of revision because of all this, even though I’m doing really well in all my other subjects. I have a few friends but they’re not in any of my classes. I did well in the previous years because our teachers never made us talk to the whole class and I was in a class with my friends. I feel so stuck right now."
Anxiety,"Honestly the worst thing happened to me, the thing I feared most &amp; that was getting Covid and now I have had long Covid for 8 months with no end in sight….","I was perfectly healthy, 27 years old and lived normally. Now I have POTS, neuropathy, sensitive to noises, etc…..all from a mild Covid infection that didn’t even make me sick fr. I feared this and now living it is hell, anxiety 24/7, doubts, scared of what the future holds. Any other long haulers in this community?"
Anxiety,Being on autopilot/existential anxiety,"It feels like the ""me"" isn't ""me"" anymore. This feeling suddenly developed when I got a panic attack driving to the gym a few months ago, since then the reality hasn't looked the same. I go through everyday being on autopilot, it's like I am just a mechanical creature part of the nature that is just operating on consequences and the universe is just unfolding itself, like I'd have no free will at all. I see, I hear, I think, but they feel so distant, it's like they're not mine. Sleeping is also hard, It's like I'm having an existential crisis 24/7. I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for that."
Anxiety,Coping with extreme stress,"Waking up shivering, shaky, nauseous, headache and feeling of doom. I just really want someone to talk to right not"
Anxiety,anxiety relapse,I've been going to therapy for a year for my stress and anxiety and it was going great for a while but today I had the worse relapse ever. I can't breath I want to cry and those suicidal feelings came back all of a sudden. I can't think what to do it's like my brain is blocked by something what can I do?
Anxiety,increasingly anxious about work,I work in a pharmaceutical field. The production side of it more specifically. My job as far as I'm concerned is one of the best ones I've had but I fear I'm ruining my opportunities at my workplace to do anxiety. Since I produce medicine it causes alot of anxiety for me since I wouldn't want anyone to get sick or anything due to an error. The reverse side of that is the quality at our plant is very strict and you can be reprimanded for mistakes in quality. Ontop of that the medicine shortages add stress aswell.All of these of these though processes compile together to create an unstoppable anxiety train. Every morning I work I have trouble sleeping and wake up just to have anxiety attacks at the thought of going in. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. I've been calling in more and more frequently because I can't control my emotions before the start of my shift and end up being in a state of stress and panic all day because of calling in. I'm in a viscious cycle and i have no idea how to get out of. I don't know if this is more of a rant or I need advice but typing this out has atleast made me feel a little better and thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.
Anxiety,How I live with anxiety,"Honestly, I feel more and more as if my Anxiety has more become physical than mental, I don't feel any actual mental suffering from it anymore, it's just when I start having an anxiety attack, I feel like my body is suffering but inside I am completely fine.

I do not fear anything in particular and I know that there is nothing truly to fear because all true suffering is caused from within. Sure when you step on a Lego brick it hurts, but it is only pain and not suffering. Suffering is when you let your pain overtake you. In this sense every time I have a panic attack I feel physical suffering in the sense that I feel a panic attack, but I don't suffer."
Anxiety,anxiety not making me feel confident enough to take up an interview,"A few months back I started working in this high paying tech job. After stressful weeks at work because this company has a reputation of neatly firing people showing performance reasons so they keep getting high performers, my overthinking brain couldn't stop thinking about it. I would push myself and try my best to get my work completed as a new joined and i got called out for being late. Somehow i spiralled after that and I went into a tremendous anxious mode. I have never been this anxious my whole life. Long story short, 2 months has been hell. I dreaded going to work, dreaded putting myself in stressful situations, was constantly panicking, lost motivation, quit my job even though tech market is terrible for people like me now, depressed because my actions induced out of anxiety had done too much damage to my career etc etc. Fast forward to few days back, i got an interview from a company where I already secured a job offer a few months back. Interview prep means I need to dedicatedly study for a month to be confident. I have interview scheduled next week and it's triggering me so much. I am back again caught up in this vicious cycle and I am terrified to face a stressful situation again. My life is a mess now with me funnily ruining all good career related things. I am panicking now, not even thinking of preparing and borderline suicidal because I fucking don't know how to escape the thoughts. They make me question if I am putting an act of anxiety when I am just too lazy to try. I feel like shouting at myself. I am just overwhelmed with anxiety sucking the life out of me. Should I take up the interview or should I just cancel it ? There is no option for me rescheduling it because they need to fill the positions urgently. I had already passed this interview 7 months back but they wouldn't take those results, Want me to do a full loop again. I am extremely under confident and anxious. And i am terrified if i am acting to myself to get away from my laziness under the garb of calling all of these ""anxious"". Please tell me if i should take this interview or just skip it for now?"
Anxiety,weird anxiety symptoms,"all the symptoms i have are quite diverse and strange, does anyone else have these?
- weird muscle ache (only in the right leg calf), feels like a restless leg but not exactly.
- slight lightheadedness/wooziness frequently throughout the day (even when im not exactly anxious). 
- heart palpitations (random &amp; frequent)"
Anxiety,i just said I can't go to birthday party,Felt too anxious about me braking in party and start crying in front of people. So I just said I can't go and now am crying alone
Anxiety,am i a monster ? is this attempted murder? please help me. i am freaking out,"TW: mention of narcissistic person, murder, OCD, mental illness.
So last year i was so depressed and drowned with my OCD. I didn't think I'd make it out. I had false memories, intrusive thoughts, severe guilt etc. 
Now a bit of background, my grandmother was mentally abusive to my entire family. She is narcissistic and gave us a lot of trauma. I hate that lady and I don't deny, it would be peaceful when she does pass. However I am not a wannabe murderer. 
Now some time last year, I was recovering from my depressive phase. I was in my room and my parents were going out so they asked me to just check on the grandmother who was outside watering plants and washing outside. They told me to check on her so that she doesn't fall. I don't know why i didn't bother checking. And next thing i remember is panicking when my dad made it home telling him that i didn't care enough about her to check on her. 
Another incident is, i used to use the down washroom and she would always complain to my mom that i used to wet the toilet. My mom would tell me and i would get mad and not stop wetting the bathroom. My brain is teling me that i purposely threw water hoping she falls. I don't know if this is true or not, but if it is, this makes it attempted murder right? I am now extra careful avout water, and checking on her. I don't want to be the reason someone dies. But i also feel guilty about the past. Please help me. My heart can't take this. I am having a panic attack too."
Anxiety,My job is making my anxiety worse,"Good day to you wonderful people,

I just need to vent a bit so thank you if you read all of this...I work as a saleswoman in a second-hand shop and when I started a year ago it was good.

It was actually my first job and I learned a lot about how to handle people and be a bit less anxious around big crowds, but the problem lies within my boss.

She is super passive-aggressive and my colleague talks behind my back too when I'm not there.

Everytime at the end of the day if there is a problem with money missing I'm the first they ask if I made some counting mistake or If I gave the wrong change even If I wasn't behind the counter that day.

Also they always tell me the same day or the same evening if I'm working or not so I don't have a schedule and that too got super stressful. (At first I worked part-time but then they realized they made a mistake in my contract and started to call me the same day if I needed to work or not).

Yesterday my boss told me that this weekend I was staying at home, well lo and behold no, I was meant to work all day on Saturday and she even called me.

She was clearly pissed off at me and I was super confused because the message she sent me clearly stated that I had the weekend free.

Now I can't concentrate on anything and I fear I'm going to have a panic attack as soon as I meet her this afternoon.

I haven't been sleeping well these past days and my stomach hurts a lot.

It doesn't help that I hate confrontation with other people and I'm afraid I'm going to have a breakdown in front of her which will anger her even more...

Thank you if you read all of this and I hope you have all a nice day...I just want evening to come fast and snuggle in my bed..."
Anxiety,having a panic attack. pls check previous post for context.,
Anxiety,Worst panic attack ever,"So yesterday I had probably my worst panic attack. I had a sense of impending doom all day and then it finally exploded. I got up screaming, my heart rate shot up to 220 bpm, and I literally couldn’t take a deep breath in no matter how hard I tried. I was so shaky that I couldn’t get off the floor and I could barely speak. Just scream. It was the scariest one I’ve had. Usually I worry about my health during or after a panic attack but this one was so bad that I was just like “wow I hope I don’t have another panic attack like that”. I’m so terrified. Obviously I’m fine nothing bad happened but I’m like “what if my heart can’t handle that? What if it was an episode of SVT? I’m so scared. It was almost traumatizing."
Anxiety,Non-prescription treatments?,[removed]
Anxiety,Anxiety from dreams suddenly appear during day with no reason. Any similar experience?,"Hi there. This is kind of new for me. So I'm asking around to see if there have any similar experiences.

Today for the 3rd time in a month, I suddenly have the same anxiety feeling I get in my dreams for no reasons. 1st time it happened I was cleaning my room, it lasted less than a minute. Second time I was at work on my computer. Also a few seconds. Both times I didn't care much about it. But I was curious why I suddenly had those feeling. The 3rd time was today, while I was walking. This time I went to fight that feeling. I told myself I want it to go away. But now I know I shouldn't have done so, because it made the feeling last longer. And it cause more worries.

I believe this is anxiety attacks? There are no triggers for each time they happen. And the only medication I'm using that may cause it is my hair lost lotion (minoxidil) that I have been using for pass 3-4mths. Any advice for me?

Should I get medical help? Or wait and see if more episodes happen. I'm more curious than worried. To be honest."
Anxiety,Quit my job because of anxiety.,"I posted this in a work subreddit before realizing it probably wasn't the best place. Most people don't understand how anxiety cripples a person. Long story short, I quit my job because they enforced a 24/7 call support and each of us has to take a month-long shift. I can't do that. Being on call in general gives me anxiety - I can't imagine doing that for the whole month. Just thinking about it in these past three days gave me multiple panic attacks I ended up being physically sick. I don't want to know what a whole month would do to me.

It saddened me so much that I have to quit. But I know I can't do the on-call even if I wanted to. A part of me is angry with myself for not being able to toughen up - but then again, anxiety disorder isn't really something that I can will away overnight.

Not being employed gives me anxiety too - but not as bad as work did. I'm actively looking for a new job now. Hopefully I'll get something soon. Thank you for reading."
Anxiety,"Same thing keeps happening, scared I’m in timeloop","I was playing a shooting game and we kept landing in the same place, every round. The same kind of thing happened, I got weapons, and went to another place on the map. I would get shot a bunch of times in the place me and my teammates landed, but survive. I would always run to another place in the map and then die there. My teammates would be stuck somewhere else doing something else. At first I thought it was a funny concidence, but now I’m scared I’m stuck in a timeloop of some sort and that thing will keep happening. It’s been like 5 rounds of the same thing happening, land, get shot, run away, die, teammates stuck doing something. I feel like I’m going psycho. Any help or ways to calm me down??? Is it just a stupid coincidence?"
Anxiety,Extreme anxiety about serotonin syndrome,[removed]
Anxiety,I think I have an anxiety disorder,"I feel like everyone around me is always judging me in class, or laughing at me or staring or something like that. I am getting quite worried about going to school in the morning and even making small movements like tucking my shirt back in or potentially looking stupid.

I often get to the point of almost leaving class (I don't like doing that because I can't stop thinking that people are talking about me behind my back) or not responding because I hate how I sound and I'm really self conscious about how I talk (I'm a teenager and ""talk like a 50 year old man"" according to several people).

My friends are a bit of a mixed blessing I guess. I like being around them and being comfortable, but they often make fun of the way I talk, since I am half american and say some words the ""american"" way (like aluminum). They also often repeat words or phrases I have just said and saying it in a really over the top southern accent.

I hate how I look. I just don't like it, my face especially. I have acne and almost none of my close friends have any at all. It makes me feel like an anomaly.

How do I tell my parents? My mum has a lot going on and my dad is very busy.

I want to clarify, my parents are the most amazing people I know, they have nothing to do with this.

Sorry for the long post, just wanted to get this off my chest."
Anxiety,Terrible parents,"I have not lived with my parents for years, however they always find ways to ruin my life and cause my anxiety to flare up. The most recent incident was at own wedding earlier this month when they invited people I am not on good terms with and I specifically told them not to invite. Seeing these people everywhere I look at my wedding just made it miserable for me and the whole time I was thinking my relationship with my parents instead of being present it was supposed to be the best day of my life. I confronted them after the wedding and somehow they made themselves out to be the victims and said leaving out those people would reflect badly on them - but it’s not about them!!! 

I can go on about similar stories. Am I overthinking this??"
Anxiety,"Nobody to talk to, I am about to implode.","Ita saturday which means as per usual I spent a few hours crying whilst my boyfriend ignores me because he ‘doesnt know what to do about it.’

I am having a terrible time:

I was given a new role at work which for only a modest raise, included double the effort, it also included doing TWO, professional certificates of higher ed. I am also having to take on duties of staff who left the business. 

My bf doesnt make money with his projects so i now have small savings and little disposable income (i know this could be worse) but I started to resent him for not working when I wale up at 5:30 each morning to grind.

I have lost my best friend of a decade from growing apart, she just ghosted me eventually.  She was my last friend, now I am friendless in a foreign country which makes it harder.

Ontop of all this I have missed my period this month, and I am too afraid to buy a test (even though we are always safe).

Anxiety,this is the worst flue ever,"So a few days back when I was going to bed I though I felt something poking me in my throat, when I woke up the next day I had a pretty bad throat ache and a pretty bad cough. Later that night when I was getting ready for bed I noticed I did not feel too well, and I was cold, which I associated with having not got dressed, but when I went to check my temp I had a fairly small fever, so I threw on some clothes for sleeping, something I rarely do, before getting back into bed where I felt hot, so I took buckles pills and an advil, before going to sleep, I woke up feeling horrible, horrible cough, my throat hurt  my lungs hurt, some if my joints and stuff hurt and I still had a fever, that night I had some sleeping pills but I found a bed bug in the bed (we have been having them for about a week, the exterminator comes on Tuesday, but none the less I flushed te baby bug and went to sleep, then I woke up this morning feeling potentially worse, coughing, aches, etc. I am nervous as all hell I got pneumonia or rabies or something but everyone right now is just telling me I have the flue.

What input do you have, and if it is just the flue how do I take my mind off it."
Anxiety,I’m surly destined to be alone so I’m going to commit suicide tonight fully,[removed]
Anxiety,In desperate need of reassurance and support,"I just read something online and it freaked me out, now I can’t sleep. I’m just so tired of living with GAD, I’ve been drained for the LONGEST time, even sleep is no more an escape form reality cus I wake up with those extreme headaches. I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone, it’s hell."
Anxiety,How do you master being yourself?,How do you master being yourself in gatherings and when meeting new people? Have you been through this and figured it out?
Anxiety,I don't know if I can keep going,"I'm not suicidal or anything, but I just feel so weak and burned out. I just have no more strength.
My relationship with my boss is an absolute nightmare, he clearly thinks very little of me, and wants me gone. He said as much in late June. but where I'm from firing people is quite hard, strong legal employee protection. But he can and is making my life miserable. I love my company and would love to stay and I think I could be better at my job if I just had a different boss. I'd love to stay but I just don't think I can. it's making my anxiety sky-high and I'm just suffering. Its breaking me already. I can't quit tho. So I've started looking for new jobs. But my boss has managed to make me doubt myself so much I feel overwhelmed and scared thinking about interviewing. Ive lost all faith in my professional self, in the career I've chosen, the things I've done to get me there. Thinking of trying something new but that idea scares me too. Urgghh... Just feeling so low, so empty."
Anxiety,My anxiety is getting worse and I don't know what to do,"I don't have daily anxiety but few times a month I'll have a anxious epsode where i cant really function and be a productive human. it's becoming more intense and more frequent. I was percribed hydroxyzine for those emergency type nights and it not working any more. I still get nights where I have a physical ball of anxiety in my chest and my thoughts go crazy

I know there's medication that is more effective for anxiety flare ups but im also afraid of those due to all the negative stuff I hear. I've downplayed my anxiety and talked up the effectiveness of the hydroxyzine because I'm just afraid to say it's not working. 


So I guess I'm stuck between white knuckling a worsening anxiety disorder or considering Medication that could potentially make me worse.

I'm, in general, relectutant to try medication. An old doctor tried me on wellbutrin which made me feel 100x more anxious and worsened my adhd. After a while I saw a new doctor and she tried me on 10mg Adderall It relieves my anxiety during the day by quieting my thoughts. But at night when it wears off I get restless and that's when my thoughts get too loud. I told my doctor this and that's how we landed on the hydroxyzine. 

I'm worried that if I tell my doctor the hydroxyzine doesn't work well enough they won't believe me. And im also worried that if I do get perscribed something stronger I'll become dependant and make the situation worse. My own mom has a perscription for emergency type situations and I'm for some reason afraid to open up to her and ask her advice"
Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety when they can't get to sleep?,"I have noticed over the past couple years issues with sleeping, staying asleep, and all things related. The problem is, there are some nights where I'll lay down, typically around 930-10PM ready to get to sleep. However, occasionally I will struggle to get to sleep, and I might be laying there for an hour or more. When this happens, I start to feel very anxious, and worried. My thoughts will quickly spiral out of control, I worry that I won't be able to function in the morning, I worry that my memory will be damaged from not enough sleep, and worse. It keeps spiraling out of control, but usually I will end up getting to sleep at some point. I do have OCD and I think these thoughts are considered obsessive and intrusive."

Anxiety,Upper and middle back pain of course scared its an embolism,Hey guys. How do you deal with the anxiety where you have completely convinced yourself its something seriously wrong? I've had terrible back pain for 4 days moving from one side to the other and extremely bad in the spine right down the middle. Its in my shoulders as well and my GERD is acting up giving me chest pain and burning so naturally I assume its a pulmonary embolism.  I cannot for the life of me shake this thought. I dont have risk factors (have an iud not bc pills and still a bit overweight although lost 60 lbs the last 2 years) I do sit for work all day so probably a posture thing but I can't shake it. I spoken to a dr and of course because they didn't do any tests im just sitting here in fear. Its exhausting. What really makes you guys believe you're ok? Hope you're all feeling ok today! Thanks!

Anxiety,Mdma and anxiety,"Hello,

I’m going to try to keep it very short. 

I took mdma several times before in multiple occasions and different amounts. 

However, last year I had a panic attack (totally irrelevant from mdma, was just a regular day) and ever since I have extreme anxiety to the point that I’m not even able to drink coffee properly. I can hardly finish 1 coffee and then I get all cloudy in the head and sometimes even need to lie down for 10 minutes to chill again. I haven’t tried any drugs except weed ever since because I’m obviously scared to -when I can’t even drink coffee properly-. I have to note that i also have been using antidepressants for the last few months(but very low dosage).

Long story short, i want to take mdma again. I saw researches about it being even good to the anxiety however I also saw a lot of arguments for it being bad to anxiety.

Has anyone had a similar experience before or knows someone that had it? Or any experts among us that can help? Can I safely use it?

Thanks in advance"
Anxiety,What medicine cocktail works for yall best?,just wondering.
Anxiety,[LONG] Decided I'm Going Back to Therapy for the 1st Time in Six Years,"Hope you can forgive my disorganized thoughts. Have far too much on my mind at the moment.

So I've been unemployed for the past few years. We had a house fire when I was 21 and I needed to halt my education to stay with my family and help them cope with the situation. Then the pandemic started in 2020. Then we took in my grandmother with Dementia last year. 

That last one was meant to be temporary until we could find a nursing home, and part of the reason I chose not to get back out and get into the workforce sooner is that I agreed to help my mother deal with the situation, but there's no end in sight so we've agreed I should get a move on with my own life.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Rewinding the clock a little bit, I had a mental breakdown in 2017, when I was first diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. When I was 19. Ended up losing over ten pounds in two weeks, was only getting an hour or two of sleep at night, couldn't keep solid foods down without throwing up, and did consider suicide at the time just to make the mental agony stop. 

This was primarily due to an existential crisis I was going through at the time, being deep into philosophy and the like at the time. Was a period of time where I was questioning what was real and didn't know what to do. 

I ended up being brought by my mother to the local hospital, and put on the behavioral ward to see if they could help me. Even with that, it wasn't until I personally was able to form a good argument against the ideas that were killing me at the time. 

Then I started doing an out-patient program for about a week. Then I went to therapy for a few months. By the time I was on the out-patient program, I was feeling a lot better, and the therapy probably wasn't necessary. But it was good to just have someone to talk to. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Back to the present, and the future, I'm looking to find a job in the next year. I've got two paths right now - I can either try my hand at YouTube, which is something I'd love to do and have a passion for, or I can work retail for a year to get the 9-5 experience and see what way I want to go. I know some people will think the first option is stupid, especially with everything I've said here, but I know I'd always regret not trying it if I didn't.

But, if I try it and I don't get any traction in the next year, then I'll absolutely need to get into a more traditional job, and that's what worries me. 

I worry about being incompetent, or not having enough time to enjoy my hobbies like I have for the past few years, or feeling obligated in being friendly with my co-workers, or growing bored and restless with my work no matter how well it pays me. I worry about my own historical lack of discipline, frequently forgetting about things as soon as I pick them up because I get bored. I know I'll never know how it is until I get started, but the fear is so crippling that its getting to that point where I can't just ignore my mental health and try to power through it anyway.

Everything feels so massive right now, and I'm clinging to my hobbies as a source of comfort (i.e. watching YouTube, talking to friends on Discord, and reading) - which only makes the idea of having less time for them even more upsetting. Even though I hardly thought about them that much before. I used to think about all the jobs I could do, and when I was in my most outwardly confident and self-assured moods I would actually get out and talk to people more often since I felt this overwhelming need to do ""**something**"" to get my life on track. I have to make myself believe that I can feel like that again, and be that positive force that has kept my family together for the past few years after everything we've had going on in the past three years.

Still, the sheer panic racking my body is killing me right now. A thought that keeps running through my head is practically begging people to talk to me so I can get my mind off of things. 

At the end of the day - I understand that it's okay to be scared of change, most people are and its normal, but I shouldn't be losing five pounds in about a week and feeling like I'm going to throw up every single day.

So I'm going to go back to therapy sometime in the next few weeks, and see if talking to my old therapist can help me get my head clear."
Anxiety,I have ROCD is what I did while checking considered unfaithful?,I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a few years and I love him and he is the best thing to ever happen to me. I knew from the moment we started dating that he was special. OCD always finds a way to come in and make things hell for me. I met my boyfriend on a dating app and the same time I was talking to another guy on the app who I met there as well. A few days after my boyfriend and I agreed we were dating I kept have ocd thoughts about maybe I didn’t like him even though I knew for sure I did and I kept getting this nagging feeling to text the other guy that I like him even though I didn’t and did not have any intention of dating him to check to see if I was really attracted to my boyfriend. Right after doing this I blocked him and haven’t spoken to him since. I would sometimes look at other guys and see if I felt anything to check if I’m still attracted to my boyfriend. Eventually I got over this but my ocd flared up again and I feel so bad I did these things while checking. Does this count as cheating and what should I do next time I feel the urge to check. Also to clarify I would never do anything physical.
Anxiety,I feel so awful lately,"I don’t know what’s wrong. I think about death all the time. now i’m in a weird mood like I always feel off. no matter what I do I can’t stop it. I have no idea when or how it will happen i’m always anticipating it. I can never relax it’s all I think about. I keep trying to imagine it. It’s so tiring. I’m always so nauseous, my headaches haven’t gone away, I always feel so uncomfortable. It’s weird because I used to have health anxiety and now it’s like I almost just don’t care anymore. I would give anything to be able to just be okay for now. todays my birthday and i’m not even excited because I feel like shit. If I have a rare moment of happiness I feel like that means something bad is going to happen and I start the worry all over again. sometimes I really feel like there’s no way what I feel is just anxiety but i’m to tired to even care. I’ve been to the doctor so many times and they tell me nothing."
Anxiety,Flu symptoms,"Anyone legitimately thought they had some sort of virus but it was just from chronic stress/ anxiety? I felt like I was coming down with something yesterday, super bad body aches and super run down. my throat was a little sore and my stomach felt off and no appetite. Today same thing but it’s like neither a cold nor a stomach bug, somewhere in between. Took a Covid test and it was negative. Just confused if I have a virus or this could possibly be a result of anxiety since I’ve been super stressed this week since my mother in law is visiting from Australia. I swear it feels like a virus."
Anxiety,Emotional rollercoaster,"  I've been dealing with GAD and social anxiety for many years, but the last 4 months has been a challenge for me.

But the next week I have an emotional breakdown and the anxiety becomes worst than ever. It keeps oscillating, Idk if I'm making progress or not :-/"
Anxiety,Heart palpitations,"Hey guys, I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, this year I have been having very bad heart palpitations, out of nowhere. My family has no history of heart problems, and I even went to two cardiologists and got an echocardiogram done and both of them said my heart was normal. I literally used to get perfect sleep before this, but now that this happens I usually have a hard time trying to sleep at night and/or keep waking up in the middle of the night. It got so bad to the point where I had to quit my job and move back in with my parents. I am a 22yr old male out of college, I think I may have anxiety problems because these days its hard for me to talk to people without not feeling relaxed. But I am not sure. I take magnesium before bed and it seems to help a little bit. But I really don't want to resort to anxiety meds. Has anyone else experienced this? And if you have what did you do/take to fix it? I am sorry that this post is all over the place, I just really didn't know how to start off. Thank you all."
Anxiety,I'm so fed up today,"I have ADHD and anxiety disorder. I'm an adult, on medication, I have no big worries (financial or otherwise), most of the time I cope well.

But some days just suuuuck.

I'm feeling so overwhelmed today. I have cervicogennic dizziness/vertigo (caused by bad posture, sedentary lifestyle and also the anxiety) and it's quite bad today. I have overslept, because I couldn't sleep last night and fell asleep at 3 am. I'm unable to do anything today (I wanted to relax doing a hobby), because the ADHD procrastination kicked in. I'm a bit sick to my stomach, because I ate too much sugar in the last three days. My kitchen is a mess and I can't make myself to clean up at least a little bit. I have a physiotherapy appointment on tuesday which I'm looking forward to, because the PT will unblock my ribs and the dizziness will get better, and I'm also dreading it because I'm worried I'm still gonna be feeling like crap. (The PT knows I'm anxious and sensitive and has no problem with it, but still.) Oh, and the weather is so grey and gloomy today.

Thanks for coming to my rant."

Anxiety,My bf just broke up with me and I have no other friends,"This post is probably a mix of a vent and me searching for advice. I (18f) don’t have any friends, mostly bc nobody in my class shares any interest I have. I do talk to them but I don’t feel comfortable. My ex on the other hand was like the best thing that ever happened to me, he’s kind, loving, understanding, shared so many internstes with me and loved my weirdness. He lost his feelings, can’t really change that. But now I’m freaking out, my anxiety is going wild (talking frequent panic attacks, haven’t eaten in 3 days and struggle to do anything). I know it’s normal to feel like that after a break up, but I got nobody to talk to… he was my best friends, even his friends were better friends than the ones I have in my class. He said I could always come to him if I needed comfort even as we broke up, but I can’t go him, it would just break me more. I’ve made a big mistake relying on him only, I know. I’m posting this in hope I can get some advice, how to calm my anxiety, only the thought of what comes next already drives me crazy… I’m really so scared."
Anxiety,Random supplement question,"Im trying to drop a few pounds so I paired my exercise and diet with the supplement berberine. To my surprise, I noticed quite a drop off in my anxiety levels. I appreciate some of this could be to the increased exercise, but it's nothing I have not done before. Several other supplements recommended for anxiety have not worked for me. I am also sleeping GREAT. 

What would be the reason for this?"
Anxiety,separation anxiety,"so my fiancé is leaving for a week on monday and i’m really nervous. he did this last year too and when he did it was really hard because of the anxiety symptoms. my stomach is always the first thing to be messed up when the anxiety starts and then it triggers more anxiety and i worry what if i can’t handle it while he’s gone. i could barely eat from the lack of appetite, i didn’t wanna do anything all it seemed like i could focus on was him coming back. and then when i focused on how much longer i had left the anxiety would kick in even more. the morning and night anxiety was also terrible. i want so badly to be able to go through my days as i usually do when he is here and be okay but just based on how it is every other time he leaves i feel like it won’t happen and i’m nervous. any tips or has anyone dealt with this too?"

Anxiety,"This is torture, what is this?","Can anxiety disorder act like this? Something else?

Made up example: 

You have an intrusive thought to touch an arm, you have a rush of anxiety fearing you are going to do it then for some reason it happens(like you are already interacting in a way where your hand is close) then you feel like you did wrong? Sexual(mostly) but was harm related once too. Touch related."

Anxiety,Anyone else get this weird feeling that’s sort of like deja vu but not quite?,This happens to me maybe a couple times a month. It’s slightly more often when I’m stressed. It’s like I’ll just be sitting there and then randomly I’ll start feeling like I’m remembering something someone did or said (occasionally something that happened) so like deja vu I guess but not about a place. And then the feeling goes away after maybe 5 or 10 seconds. Is this just a form of deja vu or am I going crazy?
Anxiety,"I can ""feel"" that something is coming but it can't make sense","I can't explain how but it's as if every part of my body somehow ""senses"" that a Gamma Ray Burst from WR104 is coming our way and that we have around 5 days left. I've been going the first 3 or maybe 4 of the stages of grief already, I am scrambling to finish watching all the shows and youtube videos that I can while everything still exists. Strangely, and this is a big one, I ""feel"" that the end is going to be instantenous, but realistically speaking, it shouldn't be, the ozone layer will be sapped and death will happen in weeks, not at once. Also, I can't understand how I can feel something that realistically has no evidence of it happening through my regular 5 senses. I think I might be in denial but I don't really know."
Anxiety,Anxiety meds,Anyone have good luck finding an anxiety medication that doesn’t have the side effects of SSRIs? Besides hydroxizine. Thank you.
Anxiety,My roommate is moving out next semester because I snore,Technically it’s also bc they can’t handle me being socially anxious but h a king thing is also an issue apparently. The last few weeks they’ve been wearing ear plugs that apparently don’t help much and I feel bad bc it’s not something that I can change so I just feel like my whole existence is a nuisance now 😞😔
Anxiety,I just realized how lonely I am and it hurts,"
I’m 21 and I just realized how boring/miserable my life is. I’m so shy and introverted and it really hurts me. For reference my bday was a couple weeks ago and I literally got no birthday texts from nobody except my sister. I have 0 friends, I’m unemployed(never had a job), I’m not in college (I did like 1-2 years and finished a couple of classes and got credits but I never got a degree and I dropped out at the end). My daily life is just sitting at home and picking/dropping off my sister to work. 

I know getting a job will greatly improve my life and push me out my comfort zone but I’m too scared. Being a slight stutter along with major social anxiety just sounds like hell. I never had a job before but I would like to get one. I was thinking about working at a warehouse or be a delivery driver for UPS/FedEx/Amazon but that won’t do me any good   (But it makes good money). I know a customer service job will help me be social and potentially make friends but I’m too nervous to apply for any.


How does someone get over this shit and start being happy? I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal/depressed but I feel like it’s getting there from constantly staying in and being lonely…"

Anxiety,Losing train of thoughts. Please read.,"I’ve only experienced this twice in my lifetime. When I had my first panic attack, I was incoherent for about 20 minutes. I couldn’t understand what people were talking or asking me and I could not form any sentences either. I could only cry because of the fear of experiencing something new and scary but it went off once I went to the hospital while waiting. 

Earlier I was watching a tv show where my partner asked me something about the main character with their name on it and I got confused for a second and couldn’t process that at all. I didn’t know who she was asking about until a minute later I saw the person on the show again. 

I wasn’t having any other anxiety symptoms. But it’s so scary to feel and be incoherent.

It's one of the things I'm starting to dread every day now.

Anxiety,I love and hate really liking someone,"Been talking to this girl I really like and have really been connecting with and the feelings seem to be reciprocated. Around her I'm calm and happy with little to no anxiety but as soon as I'm away from her I'm nauseas all the time pacing unable to think. This has happened to me before with a previous gf the first week of going out I felt like I was dying but then it went away and everything was perfect. This time just talking and getting to know each other not even going out on a date and I'm like this. For someone whos very introverted this type of connection is amazing but it also feels like the end of the world even though I know this way of feeling will pass soon.

Does anyone else get this type of way?"

I cry most of the time, while trying putting a mask on like everything is fine when i'm with my friends or bf. I wish i could make it stop.

Anxiety,Experiences with Saffron for Mood &amp; Anxiety,"I want to use it for depression, lack of drive and mainly social anxiety. So especially for the daytime, taking it in the morning.

If you have experience with this supplement, I would love if you could share your experiences of the effects with me, I have a few questions:

1. What effects do you experience from it if you would have to describe it? Regarding mood, anxiety relief, stress, sociability, talkativeness, cognition, motivation/drive. Are they subtle or significantly helpful for depression/anxiety-disorder, profoundly noticeable, even psychoactive?

2. What dose do you use that is effective or is recommended? Please also differentiate between no extract vs extract as this is a main factor ofc. What do you use?

3. Any brand you can recommend?"

If you have experience with this supplement, I would love if you could share your experiences of the effects with me, I have a few questions:

1. What effects do you experience from it if you would have to describe it? Regarding mood, anxiety relief, stress, sociability, talkativeness, cognition, motivation/drive. Are they subtle or significantly helpful for depression/anxiety-disorder, profoundly noticeable, even psychoactive?

2. What dose do you use that is effective or is recommended? Please also differentiate between no extract vs extract as this is a main factor ofc. What do you use?

3. Any brand you can recommend?"
Anxiety,Found out at least three people at work don’t like me,"I’m currently in residency and found out today that there’s at least several people that don’t like me, either because of my personality or they don’t think I’m a great resident. I’m hyperventilating, I feel sick, I want to disappear. I am a weak resident, I am not a likable person. I want to cease existing. I’m now thinking over everyone in my program and I think at least half probably don’t like me. I feel physically ill right now."

Anxiety,Can someone with Generalized Anxiety Disorder have somatic symptoms without anxious thoughts?,"My sleep in general is complete garbage (wake up every hour at night) and my breathing is restricted proportionally to how bad I slept. Yet I don't have anxious thoughts, although I'm generally pessimistic about the future.

Is GAD always associated with conscious, anxious thoughts? Or can we have only somatic symptoms of GAD without such thoughts?"
Anxiety,about bat's and rabies,"Hello, so, about bat's if I remember correctly my family have never ever seen a bat in the house before, yet I'm hearing squeaking noises (I can't be sure if it's in my vents or if it's a bat at all) it's pretty quite but I can hear it, and my dad goes out 4-5 times a day (mostly at night, where apparantly bats are common) yet I don't even think he's ever saw a bit in our street or at all in years or ever, yet every now and then i get the thought, what if I had been bitten by a bat in my sleep, out with friends or whatever without knowing, and then start crying and just feeling shitty, but I want to ask questions, yesterday night I played bat noises to confirm or not if I've actually been hearing bats land or be on my roof and instantly got paranoid incase I lured bats(my beds below am air vent) and there's I think 2 air vents in the hall next to my room, including a square box vent thing in the bathroom, I kept on getting paranoid checking all my surroundings with torches or whatever every time I went to the bathroom, I kept on washing my hands too, wouldn't itch my eye, was scared to leave my bed, something touched my foot beside my bed I think, so I got my brother to check the bed incase a bat was under it, he said there was nothing there apart from rubbish and dust, but today I've been feeling pretty sick with headaches every now and then, do rabies symptoms (first stage) come and go? And will it take a day or whatever to come I haven't left my house in I think 2 weeks I do not know, and haven't seen my dogs lately since I'm always up my room isolating, the other days I was thinking I was going blind(still worried about my eyes) but before the rabies fear, I was shitting bricks at anueryms and calmed down about that, then the thought in my head went, my sister let our dog lick her mouth today, and then what if the dogs have rabies or whatever and I'm going to die but she'll get the vaccine or some stupid shit I don't know, I don't know I just don't know, every time I forget about a fear a new one starts, I just want to kill myself sometimes, I hate myself, I hate everything I do, I'm not normal, I'm scared to take medicine, scared of nesrly everything that can kill me, I never leave my house even when most the time my parents ask me to, it took alot of courage to leave my house last month I was happy only had a fear of sleeping (which I still have sometimes) developed a fear of rabies around then i think as I was scared to go near my cousins dog, but could someone answer my questions, if last night a bat did come through the vents after me playing the bat squeaking and flapping sounds, would I of definitely saw and heard them. This has been bothering me since last night, and last night I kept on washing my eyes every time i accidently touched them to the point I made my right eye bleed.. So could someone please answer, do the first stage symptoms like ""the headache"" and would I notice a bat and hear one around me especially when it was really quite, as it was 2 am?. Please I just want fast answers, Ive been really scared of rabies again since last night, I just want to stop worrying about these things, especially in the UK, especially when it's apparently rare in bays, especially when my dad goes out in dusk time-around 10 pm is when he stops going out, especially when my parents have apparently never seen a bat in our street or maybe even the city, especially when everyone else would notice (I live with alot of people in my house) Heck today I was scared to out my headset on to talk with my friends as I was scared of a bat being in them, I checked all around the headset and didn't see a bat nor do I think I even needed to as it would of fit in the cup I think, I just want help, I can't go to my family about these things as they usually call me stupid for thinking of such stuff, can't talk to my friends as I only have 2 and one doesn't really care about these kind of talks, and one has issues and is usually busy himself, there's no one to turn to, I'm scared of seeing help even though I always say I'll get help. Every now and then I'll want to kill myself, even though I'm so scared of death and stuff I never leave my room, I can't take this shit, I just want to be normal, I just want to get a Rabies pep or whatever but its 300 pound and I've never even seen a bat until a few weeks ago I think where I saw pics, nor do I even think they can fit through my vents as they look very very small, so as I said could someone please answer the questions about rabies and also, would you notice, hear and definitely feel a bat biting you..."
Anxiety,Feeling Abandoned,I struggle a lot with anxiety and abandonment issues. There are little things my friends do that get me really angry and sad because I jump to the conclusion that they hate me or don’t want anything to do with me. I try to just ignore these feelings because I don’t want to end up manipulating my friends or making them feel bad for me. It can be stupid stuff like I drive my friends to an event but they decide to drive back with someone else even though we’re going to the same place so I end up driving back alone. This just really sets me off for no reason and I try to just take space and blast music and try to forget about the feelings. I’m not sure if it would be better if I approached my closest friend and talked to him about this and how all the stupid shit makes me feel and why or if it would be better for me to continue not saying anything. I have a therapist as well so I’ll talk to her about this but was hoping for some more immediate feedback from people who don’t know who I am.

Anxiety,how to deal with anxiety because of old videos of me resurfacing,[removed]
Anxiety,My time at school has me constantly on edge and feeling like people are out to get me.,"I had a good, stable upbringing. My parents did their absolute best and gave me everything. High school fucked me up. Got bullied horrendously, humiliated and embarrassed on a weekly basis. I’d absolutely detest coming to school and many lunch breaks would be spent alone, sitting in a toilet cubicle to pass the time, if my only two good friends weren’t in line with my timetable on that day. I was unattractive physically, socially awkward and the perfect target for bullies across the school.

I’m now 25 and on the surface have had a remarkable glowup. I got on self improvement after a really bad breakup a few years ago and now I am an attractive man now and have a great social life, get attention from girls, many very close friends who I connect with on a deep level and just a good situation in general. Unfortunately, underneath it all I am still struggling immensely. I have developed an overly active tendency to react emotionally to anyone or anything who I interpret as trying to slight me or disrespect me, as a way to compensate for the years of bullying where I didn’t stand up for myself.

I often get into arguments at clubs and constantly feel like people are out to get me, mock me, humiliate me, particularly when I’m drunk. I then spend the next two days regretting even being in that environment massively. The sad thing is, I love to dance with my friends, it’s one of my favourite pastimes and so clubs make a lot of sense to go to. It’s just that I often find myself reacting to a negative remark someone made or if someone disrespects me I’ll get offended.

Last night a guy walked up to me outside the club and pointed a camera right in my face and took a photo unprovoked. I reacted badly, yelled at him and asked him why the fuck he’s taking pics in my face. We had a loud argument and it was embarrassing. I went home in tears as I often become overwhelmed by my emotions in such situations and resort to crying.

I see a therapist regularly and that has helped but I am still in pain.

I guess I’m just looking for some warm words and some encouragement. I’m feeling lost right now and unsure if I'll ever be able to overcome the high school trauma that dictates me till this day."
Anxiety,does sertraline work in the same way as escitalopram??," 

 (sorry for english) I took escitalopram for over half a year, all my anxiety disappeared, my mood increased significantly, and most importantly, my libido, which was zero due to anxiety and decreased mood, also finally returned to normal. I felt like I was born again. Some time later, at the party, I smoked marijuana and all the signs of nervousness returned. I told the psychiatrist about it and he prescribed me sertraline. My questions: does sertraline also help me in my libido and mood like escitalopram? if sertraline doesn't work, how long to wait for esci to start working as before?"

Anxiety,This is a question for seasoned benzo users,"I’ve been prescribed klonopin around 10+ years. When I have a night out and some drinks I do not take my klonopin (obviously) but lately I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night after a night of drinking and having horrible horrible health anxiety about my heart health. I’ll get this sharp pain in my chest. I could stand to lose 10-15 pounds but other than that I am relatively healthy as I work out 3-5 times a week lifting weights. My question is, should I completely abstain from  taking a klonopin  6 or 7 hours after drinking around roughly 6 drinks? (Btw I am working on calming down on drinking so much) please no judging!! Thanks"
Anxiety,Buspar review for anxiety,"Hey guys ,

I'm a 25 year old male who has dealt with anxiety since I was around 16. My biggest source of anxiety is my nervous facial tics I get when in certain situations. It happened once very badly in front of people and since then, I'm terrified it'll happen again, causing anxiety, and basically doing this to myself now. 

Anyway, I've tried multiple SSRI's over the years and they all killed my sex drive and or made me gain weight. I decided to try Buspar after hearing of it's nearly 0 side effects. I've been on it for roughly 3 months now and have titrated up to 15mg twice daily. 

Since beginning this I've noticed a few things. First, I have crazy dreams now and since being on the 15mg, my sleep isn't as great anymore. I also notice I have trouble concentrating now and shortly after taking it, I get a little dizzy. I've also noticed my anxiety has actually become slightly worse... Like in the situations where my anxiety arises it happens more frequently. I also feel like I'm more jumpy and slower to understand things. Definitely no side effects to sex drive though or weight. 

I'm curious how others have felt on this medication."
Anxiety,I live in a split Household. here is my experience.,"Hey all. I've lived in a split household for 10 years now as a kid. I only really started dealing with anxiety issues after some stuff came up about me dating someone. But it's just so exausting now. I constantly manage exactly what information everyone has, and it feels like I can't talk to my stepmom or dad without having to carefully moderate every word I say,because they might judge me if I don't. I'm just constantly worried around them, and super tense. When I get back to my mom's house, I relax and usually go into a depressive crash for a few days, which makes it really difficult to be productive. Every time I communicate something poorly or information goes to my dad and stepmom not through me, they get mad at me and usually end up yelling at me. They've said stuff like that they are unsure if it's worth keeping a relationship with me. 

Additionally, my major support pillar in my life, my girlfriend, broke up with me not too long ago, and I really have no idea how to cope with anything anymore. I've managed to keep going but it feels more crushing every week."

Anxiety,"Anxiety usually feels like your going to die, but what about you feel like you can’t stand living?","I have severe anxiety and also OCD, and yes, i have gotten the panic feeling of I feel like I’m going to die, but there’s this new one I get. And it’s the worst of it all and it’s quite the opposite, I feel like I can’t live or be alive anymore… and this is making feel very very trapped. This is scary. I can’t stand being alive. It’s like I’m hyper aware of being alive. I just feel trapped in living and I feel like I’m being forced to live. This is scary. I just can’t stand being alive. I want to know if anyone knows or felt this way before, and is true this is really a opposite effect of feeling like your going to die? Meaning, instead, you feel like you can’t stand being alive anymore?"
Anxiety,Major life changes,"I am a 24 year old international student. I've recently moved to Germany for my second bachelor.  I always had anxiety but moving into another country brought the difficulties with it. I am always feeling on edge and helpless. Luckily, the programs language is English. However my native language is not English. That's why I am having these self-doubts about my English level all the time. And I keep comparing myself to everyone in my year.

They request us to do presentations almost each lecture and I can't help but catastrophizing all the time. I just feel nervous and tired. I am not even sure why I am writing all of these here. Maybe I just wanna know that I am not alone."
Anxiety,"having another breakdown, venting distracts me ok","im in college (20F), and my anxiety is so bad that it literally gets to a point where i don't go to any of my classes just because i get anxiety attacks whenever i attend one. like my hands shake, i have difficulty breathing, and i always end up crying, you know the drill. i've already failed most of my classes because of this and i feel so pathetic all the time for having a hard time with something so simple. 

i just want to be normal but at the same time i don't have the guts to face my fears. i want to make new friends but i always feel like they're gonna judge everything about me and i know that they all have their own group of friends already. my only friends are my friends from high school and we all go to different universities so they all have their own lives now. i don't wanna tell anyone about this because im so goddamn ashamed of myself and i can't help but feel like there's something wrong with me. i mean, im 20 years old and my mom already had accomplished a lot at my age and here i am, struggling with this kind of stuff.

also, i think that depression is easier to handle because there are days where i feel happy and it can even go for days and weeks. but my anxiety never really goes away. any advice on how to control my anxiety better is very much appreciated. im willing to try anything."
Anxiety,Pharmacology question,"Hey, 

So like 3 months ago I started Wellbutrin (I picked it myself and told my GP because mainly I wanted to avoid SSRI/SNRI). While it helped immensely with depression, my anxieties are still there. Therefore I wanna ask you what are my choices/or what do you use? As I see it it's either benzos (Xanax, Valium) or Buspor if I wanna avoid SSRI/SNRI and keep it as a last resort.

I eventually also wanna commit to therapy and see if that's gonna do something.

Also I tried MDMA first time ever while being on Wellbutrin and it was nice but it also made me anxious too (maybe just the setup). Next 2 days I was kinda okeyish and then my anxieties actually eased for like a week which is kinda weird (obviously I can't prove that Molly was the reason) So maybe MDMA induced therapy could be something I should look into... or those serotonin inhibitors eventually as MDMA spike serotonin 🤷‍♂️"
Anxiety,my poem about anxiety enjoy!,"Anxiety has been assigned to me/ since I was a teen/ going back in time you would see/ me running from the doorbell to hide from these thieves/ at least that's what my mind says to me/ now I've been diagnosed with PTSD/ see what just gets me/ is I am kind as can be/ holding on to hope so I don't dive in the deep/ haunting thoughts are just mean/ consistently attacking my self esteem/ holding on to hope to try and believe/ this fight or flight mode will die and recede/ my sympathy goes out to all who are just trying to breathe/ it seems never ending but that's just a lie we believe/ so that's my time thanks for your time and the read/

The adrenaline and heart racing anxiety gives me is killing me and I just want a way to make it stop that isn’t a prescription or career shift. If you have any advice please let me know"
Anxiety,"I am starting with Citalopram, and I have some questions","Hi guys,

Im new to this subreddit so if these kinds of posts are not allowed, please let me know. So I have been dealing with GAD and panic disorder since I was about 12, and I was always against using medication as I wanted to try and deal with it myself. Well, 13 years later, I figured, 'Fuck it, I will just see how it is'. So today my GP prescribed me Citalopram and I'm already getting anxious just thinking about using it after reading the side-effects. I just took the first pill and I'm already dizzy and panicking a bit because of it.

 So some questions I have:

\-I love to drink with friends every week or 2, I read that it is not dangerous to combine but it'll just make you very tired. Anyone have experience with this?

\-How long did the initial side-effects last for you guys? I read that some people get more anxiety at the beginning stages, as well as an increase in bowel movements. I already need to go nr 2 multiple times a day because of my anxiety so I don't see that getting any worse.

\-I read that driving might be unsafe, this would be a big reason for me to not take these pills for a long time. At the moment I am studying from home, but when I find a job and start work, I definitely need to be able to drive. Anyone got experiences with this?

\-I read that this is something you take every day, what if you skip a day or two accidentally? Is this dangerous and will you immediately feel the effects of your body missing the drug?

And just in general: how did it/didn't it affect you and your daily life? Thanks a lot."
Anxiety,Advice for how to cope with health anxiety,"So I've been having a lot of health anxiety ever since I've developed  pain and tenderness to touch in my left breast along with other things such as slight patches of discoloration (kinda look like mole but lighter). My right nipple also has this weird tiny skin tag kinda thing on it and I'm terrified that it's cancer, specifically Inflammatory Breast Cancer, which though very rare, happens in younger women, is much more fatal and very difficult to detect. I went to a doctor but instead of it being a reassuring process, the doctor didn't really listen to my complaints or examine me properly and now that has only added to my anxiety. Sometimes i feel like I'm overreacting maybe, but other times I'm almost convinced it's cancer and i have really bad anxiety attacks. I really don't know what to do. Has anyone experienced anything similar or does anyone have advice on how to manage my anxiety."

Anxiety,this one's real,"i've had this really ugly mole on my breast for almost seven months now and am seriously kicking myself for not getting it checked sooner. asymmetrical, uneven borders, almost 1 cm in diameter, it fits ALL the criteria and is definitely different from all other moles on my body. there's absolutely no way this isn't melanoma. i've been crying all day. with the delay in diagnosis the prognosis is sure to be far far worse. it hasn't changed or evolved in any way but fits all the other criteria + everything ive read about melanoma so that doesn't matter anyway. this isn't me seeking reassurance at this point i honestly give up. 

i have exams (that i already haven't studied for AT ALL) and am instead wasting my time crying and hyperventilating over this. but honestly if it turns out to be what i KNOW it to be, then what's the point in writing those exams anyway?  i have terrible health anxiety but this time is truly TRULY different this is real. i give up"

Anxiety,Twin with separation anxiety,"I have related my anxiety that I get when separated from my wife(and anxiety in previous intimate relationships) to being separated from my twin in school in a very sudden, cold way when I was too young to understand. Before this separation we had basically spent every waking hour together.

I figure fellow twins or sufferers of anxiety may be able to understand and offer some advice. The problem is that whenever I am left alone, for any length of time I over eat and damage my health from doing so. I could really use some help calming myself. I have actually been to many therapists for other things and made a lot of improvement in my life as a twin who is far away from my other twin, but I still struggle- mainly with eating and finances, impulsivity when I’m left alone. 

It doesn’t feel like traditional anxiety, as it’s not the bone rattling, nervous feeling kind that affects your breathing, heart rate, at this point, probably having lived with it for 32 years, it just feels like my baseline. I know it must be separation anxiety.
Please- anyone- help! Maybe there’s a book or something out there for me/us? 

Thank you."
Anxiety,"Anxiety leading to thoughts of suicide, but it’s not because I don’t want to live","My anxiety lately has been out of control and I’m constantly plagued by thoughts of death lately. I feel like it’s evolved into severe OCD as well now and I’m honestly scared to even write about this as I’m anxious I’ll “jinx myself,” but I know I need to talk about it. 

It’s not because I don’t want to live anymore. No, it’s the opposite. I am so scared of dying and of death but I am constantly plagued by intrusive thoughts surrounding it. I have health anxiety, anxiety about war, anxiety of flying on planes, trains, riding in cars. You name it, I’ve probably had a thought of dying. 

I am just so tired of it and it’s become so out of control that thoughts of suicide have surfaced just so I can escape from both a painful death and my intrusive, scary thoughts. I don’t feel like me. I can’t be around my friends. I don’t know what to do ):"
Anxiety,I (m18) hurt myself after my parents had a fight.,"My parents were having a drink when my dad got mad at my mom for no reason, I don't wanna go to deep into that. But after being screamed at and insulted multiple times trying to help my mom and backing off my dad. They went to bed. So at that point the voices started getting to me. I made myself buy cigarettes in a hope that I would get serenity and alcohol to make me go to sleep any how. So when I was through 1/3 of my whiskey I started putting a warm lighter on my hand (but luckily the lighter didn't get very hot), my voices in my head were telling me to that (they said that I should hurt myself).. so I went outside for a cigarette in the hope that it would give me a peace of mind. So when the cigarette was nearly finished my mind started saying that I should put out the cigarette on my hand it was constantly going through my mind and when the cigarette was finished I gave in and I put the burning cigarette out on my finger burning ash also fell, I also put my finger on that all with the intention of hurting myself. What do I need to do and should I tell a therapist when I go into therapy. This has been my first encounter with self harm."

I once had a Nanna nap and I woke up and struggled to walk, it was like I was drunk, with that came nausea etc.  I hated that feeling and touch wood I have never had that again. I am assuming that was a panic attack as I woke up with a jolt and kind of forgot where I was for a second lol


On the other hand the dizziness that lasts a few seconds and feels like you are falling I can absolutely deal with, I just tell myself it will go soon and sometime I even laugh when it happens. I think this makes it go quicker by telling my brain there is nothing to see here lol
The nausea and diarrhea in the mornings I can stand too.  To me they are the least of the symptoms and now they both have completely gone I think because I was able to cope, paid them no attention and just though “ this too shall pass”


The only symptom I  mainly have now is a feeling like adrenaline or nervous.   It’s for no apparent reason and breathing technique helps.  It’s a weird feeling and not sure if I like it or not.
I am tapering off medication too so possibly could be a side effect from that.


What are some symptoms you struggle with and what are some that you can cope with no worries?"

Anxiety,Is coffee coffee causing my anxiety to spike?,"I know this may be odd to hear, but recently I saw a post on meditation where a Redditor was explaining that his coffee intake was causing him to have trouble concentrating. So, he switched to tea. That post caused me to wonder, am I going through the same unaware of the consequences? 

My coffee intake is this. 
6-7 AM - 2 mugs of coffee before the gym. 

10-1 PM, potentially another mug or two. 

2-5 PM, another mug. 

I need to explain that I drink black coffee because I do intermittent fasting, and I suppress hunger with it. The question becomes, is this intake of coffee spiking something that's preventing me from focusing and then rushes thoughts into my mind uncontrollably?

Anxiety,"Wanting to leave a few days earlier from vacation, GF doesn't like it","Hi dear community,

&amp;#x200B;

I have anxiety for a long time, but I am diagnosed officially with GAD and Emet\* since a good year. Traveling was never easy for me, as I don't like to be away for a long amount of time from my home and area. My girlfriend and I are going to South East Asia from Europe. We booked for two weeks. However, in retrospective, I feel 2 weeks is too long for my anxiety. I also have to take Benzos\* to ease the anxiety while there. I proposed to my GF that we change our booking to maybe 9 to 10 days instead of 14 it would be a lot easier. But she doesn't want to, and I should stay, she said. She thinks I should stick it out. Her family will also be there, so if I would leave earlier, she wouldn't be alone. Do you guys think, for my own sanity, I should leave earlier even if my GF doesn't approve this decision and risk some relationship problems? I'm also thinking if it's hurting my comfort zone, I should do what I think would be best.   


I like to also have some days at home before I have to work again, since I will start a new job two weeks after vacations and still have a lot of work to do in my current job. Btw, the flight is tomorrow, so I would tell here that I leave while we're there.

TL;DR: Traveling to South East Asia from Europe tomorrow, and I feel with my anxiety I can't handle two weeks and want to change booking to 9 days to go home earlier. GF would be there with family, but she doesn't want to go home and insist that I stay two weeks.

Anxiety,Anxiety and stress is making me vomit,"It’s been a few weeks now, and I’m still having issues with vomiting. I’ve dropped a lot of weight. I’m trying boost and other supplements to help try to keep calories up. This has happened to me in the past, but it’s never lasted longer than a week. I’ve kept up with my therapy and psychiatrist appointments, but everything the psychiatrist has prescribed for anxiety isn’t helping. Any advice?"
Anxiety,I'm a failure.,"Hello everyone, M28 (29 in feb), i live in south Italy and for the last year i've been dealing With anxiety attacks, the ""Heart Is racing i'm having an Heart Attack"" kind. The fact that i'm obese and a smoker Doesn't really help. Been obese since i was at least 15 and smoking since 2013 circa. I Always hated my body but never did anything to improve myself until i reached a ""fuck, i'm gonna die young if i keep going Like this"" Moment in around 2018.My maximum weight was 163kg, i was so fat that even walking my dog for 10 minutes caused me back pain and fatigue. So i decided to go to a nutrinionist and in a year (With no exercise cause i'm a lazy ass) i've lost 50kg, still obese but With basically another human being off mu back while walking. I felt great. While i started my new diet i'd also found my First ever job, i was 24 and never worked before. I tried going to universities but Always quit cause i felt Like i did not have It in me to finish what i was starting. Work goes good, i freaked out in the first week cause i was changing my oh so comfortable routine of doing nothing but playing videogames, but i adapted. It was only a 6months gig, but it's still experience i guess.2019 was probably the best year of my life, nothing extraordinary was happening but i was able to do stuff i previously not allow myself to do, like going to parties, going out With people i barely knew and stuff. My girlfriend has been by my side since 2012. Next month Is our 10th year together and we both loved eachother in pur best and worst moments. My family has Always been in a tight spot when It comes to Money, they never actually denied me something but still i understood when to aks for Money and when to help of i could. I am really attached to my family, this probably sounds silly for american readers or someone else, but here in Italy it's still a thing to live With your parents till you reach your 30s, for some people Is a necessity, Like in my case. Since my First job i didn't really found something else, i still did not have a driving license (could not afford It at the time) and that made me think ""i can't find a job without a car"". 2020 starts and i finally can get a driver's license! Of course covid hits before i could do my theory exam. Family did not work for the majority of the year and Life was getting pretty depressing. I regained 30kg. I could blame It on covid but i know it's my fault, i'd already started not respecting my diet in the last months of 2019, so it's totally on me. If 2020 succede ass, 2021 was the cherry on top. My girlfriend's father suffered from diabetes, he lived alone and only my GF and her sister took care of Him when they could. He was the kind of guy that did not give much thought on treatments and stuff, and living alone he was also depressed and drank all he could. I knew Him, i was not really close to Him but he never was a Dick to me or something, he was troubled, but a good man. Long story short: After a year of dhialisis, drinking, smoking and suffering he got covid, then all his organs started failing Him and After 4 days in an hospital bed he died, in his 50's. That was the First really close loss i suffered in about 20years or so. In the same period my father started having intense headaches and found out he has High Blood pressure, he's on the pill thingy and ok now, but since that happened i'm Always scared something might happen to Him.  If his BP Is too High when we measure It i start panicking and i feel my Heart going insane. Since then i'm convinced i also suffer from High BP and probably have diabetes too, i'm too scared to get tested and i Just panick at the idea i might have some of those things. My family never had diabetes cases, unlike my GF's father, all his Brothers have It to, so it's probably genetic. What haunts me to this day Is the phone call i got when my GF learned her father passed... She was crying and screaming, and She said something so innocent and sincere that It makes me cry even now: ""i don't have a father anymore"".

The thought of losing my loved ones now Is super scary to me, and i'm also paranoid about my Healt. Also, i Just got a job in a callcenter, we call people and try to sell them stuff, it's been 2 days and i'm on my way to work now, and i feel so anxious every time... I cringe at the thought of talking to people on the phone, and the thing that stresses me the most Is that i'm now breaking my routine of doing nothing all the time and complain that i don't have a job. I'm 28 and i want to be indipendent but i'm scared of changing my routine of complaining about finding a job, laying in   
my bed while watching YouTube or Twitch and playing videogames. That's what i am. I honestly am Better today than i was 2 days ago, so i probably should Just adapt to this new routine and give It a go, but my brain and body try so hard to not let me try this... Anytime i have to go out now seems Like a super hard Quest, i'm almost scared of going to a movie  don't even know why i'm saying this, probably feels Better to write It Down somewhere. I know i should see my nutrinionist again, i probably Will. I know i should quit smoking, i know i should get tested for my health paranoia, i know all that. It's Just so hard, even if It isn't. I'm a failure."
Anxiety,Anyone else find they pee a lot of work only ?,"I go to the toilet about 10 times in a shift. My shifts are 8 hours long. A GP diagnosed me with overactive bladder years ago but did not tell me what could be causing it. I struggle with Anxiety and only now just making the link. I have a therapist who is a psychiatrist so I will ask him in my next therapy session but Jesus Christ! I have suffered with Anxiety for so long and had no idea  it was wreaking havoc in my life like this :/. I think,  because I don’t have panic attacks, I didn’t take it seriously. I pee a lot less when I am at home; I hypothesise that I am less stressed and anxious and that is why 😭."
Anxiety,constant feeling of dread,"for the past 3 days i’ve had the kind of feeling you get before an interview, but all the time.

my chest feels like it’s falling, and my stomach is always tight.

in the back of my mind i feel like something bad is going to happen sometime soon, and i’m waiting for it, but idk when it’ll happen. i’m waiting for everything to fall apart.

the only time it doesn’t feel like this is when i’ve had alcohol.

is there anything i can do to stop it, or do i just ride it out?

do i just keep drinking till it fixes itself?

thanks!"
Anxiety,"My anxiety has invaded every part of my life, and it is ruining me.","Hello. This will be a long post, so I implore you to stick to the very end. 

I’m a 21-year-old student currently in my third year of university, and I would just like to rant about my anxiety. 

Before the pandemic, I went into college expecting everything to adhere to the typical university fantasy—an active social life, amazing extracurriculars, academic achievement, etc; and I was actually on track to make at least a part of this a reality during the first semester of my freshman year. However, as my second freshman semester progressed, COVID-19 suddenly came out of nowhere, the world was put on hold, and I stayed idle for a bit.

The first few months passed by uneventfully, but as my university moved towards a fully-online setup, something changed, and it suddenly became harder for me to pay attention to my lectures and to my academics. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Physics, and I used to think that I had a passion for the subject as a freshman, but during the pandemic I ended up languishing and slacking off. I suddenly fell behind on my classes—concepts became harder to understand, I received mediocre grades, and my academic sense of urgency just completely disappeared. 

All of this, combined with turmoil in my relationships and me pushing my friends and loved ones away as a result of my isolation, has contributed to me developing acute depression and anxiety, and my actions which led to developing this disorder remains one of my greatest regrets as I am still suffering the effects of these actions to this very day.

I am currently back in university, but I feel like such a shell of my former self. I had to take an informal “Leave of Absence” from my university for one semester last year, and even if I am supposed to be graduating next year, I still am considered a sophomore credits-wise, and being 21 years old, I feel like I am running out of time.

I do not know how to get back into the hobbies I once enjoyed (reading and music being my main ones), and every time I think of academics I always get hit by a severe wave of anxiety and nausea.

I am trying to get myself back in track, as I am doing my best to schedule my academic work along with subjects I haven’t completed yet via a task-scheduler such as Todoist, but I feel like such an imposter. I haven’t told my parents about my leave of absence yet, and feeling that I might graduate super late stresses me out to no end.  I feel like a fraud for essentially doing nothing during my “online” university semesters, and now that I a, getting back into face-to-face classes, I feel lost and unsure how to navigate this space once again.

Whenever I try getting work done, I always get stuck in the “scheduling” phase, as my brain continually tells me about how I need to get EVERYTHING ironed out before doing the real work. I also feel severe anxiety whenever I try communicating out to my professors and groupmates online, as I fear that they would be judging my for replying and reaching out too late in the semester. I always freeze in front of the computer whenever I am about to email them, and I end up flaking again and again.

All of this anxiety has also taken a toll on my social life. I am lucky to have a supportive girlfriend who has been with me through thick and thin, yet I worry because sometimes I think I become too clingy and overattached to her due to my anxiety issues, and that that may just drive her away. My brain constantly overthinks all of her interactions with me, and sometimes it makes me think of scenarios whenever she goes out without me. I sometimes think that I am constantly “bundled” with her whenever she does something, and I am painfully aware of it. I love her so much and I do not want to push her way, and this is why I hate my anxiety so much.

I have also pushed away so many people away during the pandemic, and I am at a loss on how to reach out to them once again. My brain tells me that I am the bad one for suddenly disappearing and hiding away from them, and yet whenever I try reaching out my anxiety takes over and makes me think of different scenarios about them rejecting me, ignoring me, etc. I have withdrawn from all social media, yet I yearn to restart my social life and reach out to people once again.

All of this anxiety culminated in an episode last week. As I was alone in my dorm room about to visit a family event, my anxiety overpowered me in such a manner that it manifested as loud voices in my head, ending up with me on the floor alone, clutching my head having a severe. panic attack. It took me hours to recover, and worst of all, I still went ahead and attended my family event, having to put up a façade that everything was okay. 

The mere act of writing this down in words, however, has comforted me a little, and I would just like to ask if any of you can offer advice or some words on how to slowly get back up. As of now, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, though I desperately want to become better again. It’s just that the voices in my head have been too loud as of late, and I am trying to seek ways on how to slowly become better again and to get rid of these anxious tendencies.

If you have reached this part, I sincerely thank you. Just knowing someone out there has listened makes me more at ease, and I wish you good luck in whatever this is we call life.

Sincerely yours,
OP

TL;DR: Developed anxiety because of pandemic, pushed people away, faced turmoil in lots of my relationships. Now feeling that I have lost my passion for my academics and for life, and am extremely anxious with reaching out to the people I have disappeared from. Need advice with getting back up and getting rid of anxiety."
Anxiety,My roommate is leaving for a vacation and wants to rent out his room for a month,"It’s a few months away but he told me recently and it’s stressing the fuck out of me. He’s also one of my best friends and he is well aware of my anxiety. Sometimes I think he just doesn’t care or can’t relate. This is like a nightmare come true. Living for a month with some random person.

I’ll have to stay in my room all the time. It makes me angry and tired. I am sick of always having to adjust to other people. I wish I had enough money to live on my own. 

I understand he wants some money back for the rent since he won’t be here for a month. But I am also tired of being understanding."
Anxiety,How do you handle toxic bosses?,"I cried so much today because my boss who has had an issue with me a long time since she joined made me doubt my self capabilities and job competency.

I have been in this role for so long and my competencies have been honed over the years by my previous boss who has now left. 

My current boss corrects my work and I cant disagree with her. She harps on small mistakes and gets a junior staff who she likes to 'guide me'. I've been silently taking it all in because I need this job but today was so humiliating. I've been passed over for promotion because I cant play the game. 

She likes the whole team but me, and I just got to know everyone received a good grade except me. She sidelines me for any major projects.

I dont know how long I can keep this up. I have tried sending out job applications but no luck."
Anxiety,Does TikTok make anyone else’s anxiety flare up BAD?,"When I felt at my worst, I coped a lot with TikTok. It let me turn my brain off and ignore my depression and anxiety for a little bit. But a lot of times things would show up on my for you page that triggered my dissociation, something I struggle the absolute most with. I also consumed a lot of horror and true crime content, which couldn’t have been good for me either. So I’m sure that’s why I feel the way I do now related to the app. I deleted it years ago for the overall sake of my mental health.

I’ve been on lexapro for a month now though. It’s truly changed my life, and I wish I went on it years ago. I didn’t know it was possible to have a head this calm and quiet, and I feel so present. So I decided “Hey! Maybe I can finally download TikTok again!”, and I did. I’m really into The Sims at the moment, so I even decided to make a new account and like purely sims content, so maybe I could associate TikTok with something good again. This worked for about a day. But near the end of the next day, I started feeling incredibly anxious and was dissociating. The most anxious I’ve ever felt while on lexapro. I was almost scared for a minute that they were just suddenly not working.

I knew what it was over. My heart started racing whenever I saw the app on my screen. But I decided to give it a couple days to hopefully clear up because I was really enjoying the sims content the app had to offer. But after a couple more days, I couldn’t take it. I told my fiancé my problem. I told him the app was making me anxious but I was really enjoying the sims content, and asked what I should do. We talked about it for a bit, and decided I should delete it again for awhile. When I did, all of the anxiety I had let up nearly instantly.

Does anyone have this kind of relationship with this app? Have you gotten over it? I’d really like to comfortably have it again :/"
Anxiety,Irrational fear,"Physically I’m healthy, I know rationally I’m doing fine, and have loved ones who are supportive, but my anxiety is driving me nuts. I feel so insecure and keep having compulsive recurring thoughts to quit. Quit my job, quit my 7-years relationship, quit life. My boyfriend has been so supportive and reassuring but I feel like I’m such a toxic waste to him, I’m constantly in fear that he will finally get sick of me leave me. I have a decent but stressful job and I’m again living in deep fear of making a mistake that could cause fairly severe consequences. I’ve been wanting to switch jobs or go back to school but worry I will fail and want to quit before I even try. I just feel like I can’t have anything nice or move onto next stage of life/relationship cuz I’m so afraid of losing it.  I mean if I don’t have them, I can’t lose them right? I’ve brought up my anxiety with my doctor and she just brushed it off every time attributing to normal stress but I’ve woken up in panic attacks crying and feeling like vomiting. 

This all got really bad the last decade, I remember when I didn’t have these thoughts ever. I just want to reverse it all and I don’t know what went wrong. Is this something I can get over with… will I be able to live and breath without all this worrying… I feel so stuck"
Anxiety,Is it normal to talk to yourself internally?,I’m not sure if these are intrusive thoughts but during the day I constantly have to tell my brain to shut up because whenever I make a mistake I automatically in my brain say things like “I hate myself” “fuck you” or “you’re stupid”. Each time I try to stop myself and in my brain I tell myself no I’m not but then my brain says it again and I’ll try to distract myself and I just keep going back and forth myself in my head.
Anxiety,I want to end my life,"I'm a 22 year old male. Finished College last July. Can't find a job, can't even get into unpaid things. I can't bring myself to work to achieve these goals, all actions towards those seems shallow. I feel like my life has no purpose, that I'm a burden on my friends, one that would live better off without. It's too late for me to reach the responsibility I think I should have. Maybe my death would be good for people to value their other friendships, the rest of their family. Maybe that could be my last good deed, my final purpose."
Anxiety,Internal shaking,"Morning all :)! 

Wondering if anyone else deals with a shaking feeling that feels like you are cold despite … not being cold? I can see my hands visibly trembling but the feeling feels more inside of my body than anything else , it kind of feels like adrenaline and im overly excited despite not being. 

Any tips to helping calm it down? It’s been consistent the last few days"

My mom takes me to work, she also is up for days at a time driving uber. She's been bitching about driving me so I told my dad and stepmom I want to drop my Tuesdays to give my mom (and myself) a break. (I'm too anxious. This job is thankless, and I'm barely making anything as is)

Of course they shoot it down. ""You need the money!"" No shit. But im starting to regret this job entirely because everything else. I literally wake up in the middle of the night and think, anxiously. For hours. Tossing and turning. Crying

Now they want to schedule who takes me and when. This also includes me having to go to work an hour before my shift and sit there doing nothing because I can't clock in. (Because my stepmom has to do some medical shit) so I say ""I'm not going in an hour earlier to not make any money"" I'm not there for my enjoyment, I'm there for a fucking paycheck and to leave. I dont want to sit there 7 hours working. Let alone an hour twiddling my thumbs. 

To which my dad says ""it's a sacrifice you have to make."" It really isn't. I didn't physically say I wanted to make said sacrifice. ""Well until you get a car, that's what you'll have to do. We're trying to give your mother a break"" what about me? I need a break too to get my fucking mental health in order.

 I'm not cut out for this. My social battery is drained entirely, my parents are dictating my life at 28, and honestly the more I think about walking in front of a car and either breaking bones or dying, either is fine at this fucking point."
Anxiety,Im scared of what kids in my school think of me,Ive been studying for the last two terms in a private school because of how bad my anxiety got. I realised that it wont get me anywhere for my future and agreed to go back after the school holidays.

Anxiety,25M about to employed for the first time and I'm scared,"Short backstory - I left school at 17 because of severe mental health issues that left me housebound and it's taken 8 years to get to the point where I'm able to think about getting a salary job (vs the minimal bits of freelance I've done here and there). 

I've just heard back from a job after months of applying with 0 experience and I'm getting massively in my head about it. It is working night/early shifts (3am-10am), 20 hours a week, preparing online orders for a big supermarket here in the UK. 

I think I'll be okay with the time of day (especially as they are relatively anti-social and I'm a night owl) but I'm getting so anxious about whether I'll be able to keep up with the 7 hour shifts after not having a regimented work routine for nearly half my life. I'm anxious about what's expected of me, and whether I'll mentally manage it all. 

I know a lot of this is just my general anxiety being... exactly that. But I can't silence it because I don't have any plausible advice for myself.

Does anyone have any advice for part-time work or night-time work for an incredibly nervous person?"
Anxiety,should i let her go or i wait?,"My girlfriend and I just broke up today. And everything is messed up. She broke up with because i was toxic because I'm at lowest point i know it will not validate my bad behavior. And she's trying to overcome her depression and right now i know i can't help her or maybe support her 100% because even me im not okay. 

She wants to break up and we heal apart to avoid toxic relationship and she want to save herself. But im afraid that we can't go back together again.

So now I said okay lets break up I understand you and i dont want to be selfish. So i let her go and said i will be better, i will fix myself and when I'm ready and she's ready we will comeback. 

But she dont want to give false hope in the future. I dont know what to do. I want to keep her but i dont want her to suffer. I want to save our relationship 😐"

Anxiety,I’m scared of being alive,I cant stop thinking about death. It’s making me absolutely spiral. how did the world even come about? what’s the point? how am I even here right now? I cant stop.

Anxiety,I may have rejected a good job because I was afraid of it,"I'm 22 and I only have 3 months of experience as an intern. A few days ago I applied to a job because I thought I suite perfectly. 

I don't have a car and the workplace is, at least, 40 minutes away, and that's when there are buses available.

But my goal is to get my driving licence as fast as I can (it would take me around 2-3 months, having the time to study the tests and driving a bit), improve my English and, if possible, getting a C1 certificate (I'm B2 at the moment) and also I'm studying for a competition (?) idk how it is said but these are the exams that let you work for the public administration, and it takes a lot of effort to pass them.

The job that I applied to has somewhat good conditions, but it forces me to be around 12 hours outside of my home, and it would be really difficult for me to combine the job with my goals, while also maintaining an enough amount of mental health to survive.

They've called me and have told me that I got the job, and I have told them that I'm sorry but some medical inconveniences about my grandmother (which are not false) (I live with her and the know) have forced me to only being able to accept the job if it's from 9 to 14, and that I would understand if they aren't able to hire me with that condition.

If they accept, it's alright, I will earn some money and I will have the time to continue studying without losing my mind in the process.

But if not, I would've literally rejected the first job I got accepted at. What do you think?"
Anxiety,First date anxiety,I am going on a date tonight that I’m really excited for but also so nervous about.

Anxiety,so many ppl were staring at me,"   Once during highschool, I sat by a girl named Alyssa. I dated her brother during my freshman year, we broke up because he let his toxic Masculinal guy friends micro manage our relationship. 

   Junior year us students sat in the auditorium for an assembly, I was sat next to Alyssa. We didn't talk, she didn't even say hi to me, no Acknowledgment whatsoever. I was chill just waiting, typing away on my chrome book. Alyssa gets up, didn't think much of it. 

   THEN, she's not even halfway across the room. She walked over to her brother POINTED at me and tells him how I'm sitting next to her. Him and his friends just stare and start laughing. EVERYONE else is looking around for who she's talking about. I half way buried my head into my chromebook. 

   Anxiety came, I was completely in shock and embarrassed. She came back and sat back down NEXT to me. I asked her why she would ever consider doing what she just did. She says "" I thought you still liked him.?? "" 

   I think it's safe to say ppl who suffer from anxiety ( or other mental health problems. ) do not appreciate unwanted attention whether it's good or bad. I'm talking about the introverts. That day made me realize anything was possible."
Anxiety,It’s my (22M) birthday week and I hate it. (TW: Existential Dread),"Ever since I was in high school I’ve hated my birthday and the days surrounding it. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed with GAD and Bipolar 2 and started therapy that I realized I have a borderline phobia of getting older. Don’t get me wrong I have no problem with aging or looking older. My “issue” is more on the mental and emotional side of things. I know that as I get older I will never be who I once was. I’ll have to make long standing commitments and every choice I ever make will have reverberating consequences throughout my entire life. But I have no idea what those consequences will be or what the future will hold. Whenever people asked me what a wanted to be when I “grow up” I could never give a legitimate answer. I hate the idea that I have to conform to a set identity. That I have to be (insert my name here). Meanwhile while I’ve got all this shit going on inside my head all my loved ones are all excited with their puckered grins. “Oh 22! Are you excited for your birthday? How are you going to celebrate?” No. I’m not excited to be one year closer to my inevitable demise. No I don’t want to celebrate given the fact I’ve been having panic attacks all week. And the fact that everyone but me is excited only makes things worse. 



TLDR: I’m scared shitless of getting older and social stigma only makes it worse."

Anxiety,I passed my driving theory test,"I pushed my date probably just under 10 times in the past year, but I did it today! I beat my anxiety, I studied, worked hard and I passed! Now on to the practical :) Yay me!"
Anxiety,Why am I so anxious to text my landlord…,"All I had to text him for is to see if he’s still interested in selling the home I’m living in, I have no reason to be anxious but I’m shaking I’m so anxious. I finally forced myself to text him this morning, I made my husband really clean up the yard and weed whack things just in case he decided to swing by. Im also always so worried he’s gonna come around unannounced. He did once and the yard needed tended to because of our lawn guy quitting. I felt mortified when I got the text.

I just hate feeling so anxious and stressed over such a small thing."
Anxiety,How can I get over a fear of messaging / meeting people??,"I'm on a gap year and all my friends except 1 have gone off to uni so I need to try and meet some new people. Doing it in person seems totally impossible - I have no idea where I would go and even if I did that would be too scary. So I'm trying to do online stuff but I am just too anxious to reply to anyones messages. I feel stuck. Damned if I do damned if I don't sort of thing. I get so stressed out by texting (so much opportunity for overthinking!) but you have to for at least a little bit before you can meet a person. I would also be terrified to meet them though, I used to be able to get drunk enough to where I could do something like that but nowadays it doesn't have the same effect on my social-ness. 

I thought me getting my first job and having to interact with coworkers would help but it hasn't, I almost feel I have less confidence in myself now than I did before I started. Sigh. 

I know I just need to start messaging people and not really take it seriously; just see it as a bit of fun chatting with a stranger who I never have to meet or see ever, but it feels like a massive huge gigantic thing that I just can't do."

Anxiety,Traumatized by someone with extreme narcissism &amp; having panic attacks because of it. Any advice?,"Long story short I met this guy 2 years ago at my job. He pretended to like me as a joke and also to use me for free therapy. After my job did nothing about the gossiping and bullying I quit. He then moved to my dream city after my friends told me. He messaged me that I was fat, ugly and that I was having a ""mental breakdown"" over him. Then proceeded to call me racial slurs. I did a idiot thing and looked at his Instagram and got anxious seeing him trying to thrive in the city. I have never met anyone this fake, hateful, and cruel. He's got a lot of people fooled. Not me and my friends though. I just want to get through this and not think about it anymore. It's also hard not to get revenge. I feel like I didn't stand up for myself at all against him. P.s. my friends think he may have NPD or BPD"
Anxiety,How to manage your anxiety when you have a bit too much in your plate,"Hey all! 

I'm a college student and I do photography and web design on the side. I currently have a bit too much on my plate, not enough money to hire help and clients behind my back telling me to hurry up. I'm working a lot but I also have a lot to do, I suffer from anxiety and I'm reaching a boiling point. Any advice on how to push through this?"
Anxiety,Fight or flight before public speaking,Does anyone else get a severe fight or flight response before having to speak in groups or to an audience especially in work. I get this so badly I can never calm myself down and it’s affecting me badly. It’s making me want to quit. I have tried to push myself to expose myself to the situation but the panic before is so severe I can’t control it
Anxiety,What are some good YouTube channels where the creator talks about interesting topics in a soothing voice?,"I don't know about you guys but listening to people speak in a relaxing tone of voice really calms my nerves more than music. I prefer videos over podcasts because they can display images and clips and I don't lose my focus.


Do you have any good recommendations? I'm open to all kinds of topic but my favourites are paranormal and true crime. 


Also please no ASMR or whispering because I find it infuriating lol."
Anxiety,anxiety or not?,"i’m so used to having health anxiety but that’s not really the case right now. I’ve been obsessing over death. It scares the hell out of me. Its on my mind all the time it’s all I can think about. anything I go to do anything my brain is like “you’re gonna die, you know that right” like why. I feel like I don’t care about anything anymore because of this. I may also have some kind of depersonalization or dissociation going on. I’d honestly rather go back to how my anxiety was before. I go so deep into thinking about existing and it literally makes me panic. I don’t know how to make this stop. I just want to live life. the world seems so scary, people are so crazy. Idk if this is anxiety or not."
Anxiety,Anyone has used lavender oil to anxiety? It worked? It does not?,"Hi, everyone, I am using lavender oil since March this year. I never believed homeopathy or essential oils, but the doctor on ER suggested and I was desperate for some thing to help me with my anxiety. Well, the results seemed very well, it helped me to not have more panic crisis during the night (I am living alone abroad and my anxiety was sky high), but I started to be constipated. Now, after a lot of research, I discovered this can be a side effect from lavender oil and I will stop it immediately to see if the constipation also stops (despite this test, I will have an appointment to a bowel expert next week)

My question is: has somebody already used lavender oil? Got any side effects? Thanks in advance for the replies!"
Anxiety,Am I experiencing a period of anxiety?,"Last few days, I have had (and still have) the following physical 

- A loss of appetite. 
- A dry mouth. 
- Tingling / warm feeling on my tongue, cheeks (inside and out) and lips. (Lips occasionally felt a little sore too.)

I have been worrying a bit lately. I think it’s caught up on me physically. 

I’ve never felt like this before."
Anxiety,Anxiety: the control freak who puts you down,"Since this is a subreddit for anxiety I’d like to say a few things about my anxiety without being judged. I hope my experiences will help people with anxiety/anxiety disorders. So I’m experiencing anxiety about 1,5 year now. It all started this damn Saturday when for the first time I had my first panic attack. Since then it’s like a switch that never turns off. Constant  Physical symptoms like fast heart rate, heart palpitations out of the blue, constant dizziness, tingling in legs, cold and hot flashes, scared of what people will think of you or say to you, overthinking Every. Single. Thing you are doing, habits like biting your nails or leg fidgeting, unable to sleep well without waking up gasping for air or waking up every half an hour. it’s a circle that never ends. Ever. It never ever ends. Will it be forever like this? This thought crossed my mind a million times. I can’t live the life I want cause anxiety holds me back. No I can’t have a nice dinner with my loved ones, I can’t watch a movie at the cinema with my friends, I can’t ride roller coasters, damn I can’t even take the bus without feeling my heart racing. I CANNOT enjoy ANYTHING in my life cause I’m just so anxious for absolutely NO reason. “Eat better”, “exercise” sure it helps. But if you don’t do that for like 2 days that’s it, you go back to anxious state. This isn’t a life. Anxiety is a curse on earth, it’s worse that Hell and I wouldn’t wish it to my worst enemy. It robs you from your own life, it dooms you forever. I wanna do wild things, I wanna go places I haven’t been, I wanna meet new people, I wanna be completely free of the anxiety chains but they will never break and I might as well try to accept it. It so depressing feeling that this might never end or the only solution is to start taking anxiety pills for the rest of your life to just normally just “live”. I had to get it out of my chest and hopefully things will get better."
Anxiety,"My ""daily crash"" is hurting my social life and self-esteem","Male, 33 here. I have diagnoses of GAD and mild depression and am in therapy. I am on Lexparo and Lorazepam. I used to have severe sleeping problems to the point where I've once gone to the hospital because I'd been awake for so long I'd just lose control mentally.  


Well, I got a 9-5 job 4 years ago and it's been the most stable career for me and after starting seeing doctors and through a lot of work, my sleeping problems have gotten incredibly better. (still have a few bad nights but nothing like it was). Now I can generally live life day to day and get through most weeks feeling good and stable...but I am thinking it's at a cost. I ""crash"" very hard at the same time, every single day, no matter what. That time is around 730pm every night, even weekends. I wake up around 530, exercise, eat and work. I think it's normal for most people to be tired around that time, but I get more than ""tired"". I just completely turn into sludge, not up for driving or socializing because I don't like my friends seeing this flat and anti-social side of me.  


In recent times, I've tested this by going to some social gatherings, and every single time around 730 I just close up and shut down and often leave early and my friends often joke with how I always leave early. How do other people push through that fog? I love my friends and miss them dearly but anything involving late nites or driving I get real anxious about and the anticipation leading to social events eats at me. It's also really embarrassing when I get laughed at about how early I go to bed and that I am so tired.   


I guess I am asking, how do you deal with those severe end of day crashes?"
Anxiety,I just did something stupid due to not focusing properly and now its giving me alot of Anxiety,"I tried getting out of a car when I was distracted and a car went right by and honked at me loudly now I feel very stupid because I wasn’t focusing properly on if a car was going by or not and I was tired so.

And I was having such a good day but now I think I’ve ruined it due to this.

Is there any way to get over this feeling its irritating to deal with."
Anxiety,just a little vent,I’m so used to having constant anxiety. for the past two years it’s been mainly health anxiety. lately my anxiety has changed more to general anxiety. Im so used to constantly worrying about my health I feel like if i’m not worrying about it that’s bad. it’s almost like if i’m not worrying about it then i’m being too sure. if I say “i’m fine nothing is wrong” that i’m almost being like cocky. i’m so worried about death lately that I feel like nothing matters anymore. I don’t even feel like me anymore. I don’t get excited about anything. I feel like nothing matters. Im disconnected from myself. I want to go back to before. I cant tell if the way i’m feeling lately is anxiety or if something is actually wrong.
Anxiety,Clonazepam not really working for panic attacks? (TW),"Hello hello 👋 

New poster, long time panic attack haver. I’ve mostly been able to manage panic attacks with basic mindfulness and the occasional low dose Xanax, but the last few months have been absolute hell - I was getting hellish panic attacks with really bad disassociation, feeling like I can’t breath etc at complete randomly moments,
often in the middle of the day at my work/office (TW: once to the point where one time I seriously injured my legs in a meeting to stay grounded and then couldn’t walk for a few days - in my 33 years of life I have never self harmed, and this fucking scared me)

Now, I’m prescribed Xanax for acute panic attacks, but I started needed it every day to function (see: severe panic attacks at work) but 1) I obviously don’t want to be taking that every day and 2) I also have ADHD, bipolar, and CPTSD, and worry a lot about mixing drugs and dying lol. 


As it turns out, I had an issue with my thyroid (I was over medicated and my TSH dropped from 1 to .1) which explains the constant panic etc, and my psychiatrist has prescribed me 1mg clonazepam 3x a day until my TSH levels out.


The problem is that this isn’t actually working 🆘 Clonazepam helps, but I’m still here hiding in the work bathroom trying to regulate my breathing and posting my woes on Reddit so what does that tell you


Have other people had an issue with clonazepam not really working well? Is 1mg a high dose? Are there other things I can do? I’m really just out here trying to live a normal life and now have a meltdown at work 🥲"
Anxiety,Having a horrible insomnia flare-up and feeling very stuck,"I haven't been able to properly fall asleep in days. I'm exhausted and I can doze/sleep lightly, but I can't fall asleep or get any deep sleep. I'm conscious and my mind is going all night. So not only am I sleep deprived, but I'm not getting any break from my thoughts or from the conscious realm. It's driving me crazy. 

Sleep supplements don't help and they even seem to make it worse. Everything seems to raise my heartrate and give me dry mouth - melatonin, weed, benadryl, valerian - which just makes it so much harder to drift off. I'm so uncomfortable at night. I took a 5mg ""sleep"" edible last night and had the absolute worst and most wide-awake night so far. 

I'm doing everything I can to relax. Going on walks and meditating outside. Doing dynamic stretches to get tension out of my body. Muscle/back self-massages using ""stress ease"" scented oil. Cup after cup of chamomile tea. I can get to a point where I *feel* very relaxed, but I still can't fall asleep. It's like a superficial relaxation. Deep down, the tension is still very much there and I can't shake it away. 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is the worst it has been since I was a teenager and I feel totally blindsided. There isn't an obvious cause, no new stressors, just the same old ones turning around and around in my head. I feel lost."
Anxiety,Is this anxiety or do I need the ER?,I’m feeling shaky and hot and almost like I can’t catch my breath. This is my 3rd day on lexapro. How can I tell the difference??? I’m out for a walk and feel better but still feel a little out of breath.
Anxiety,extreme anxiety over breaking laptop,"I spent 1000k on a laptop for college and im terrifyed about breaking it by accident. Anytime i think of something new that can possibly break it I get really scared and that is all ill think about for days, googling how likely these things are. Im really shy and gaming on it with my friends from high school is the only social interaction i get through my week and ill loose that if something bad happens. That and idk if I can afford another one if i do end up breaking it. Everything from power surges to just dropping on accident has me so scared. How do i stop this?"
Anxiety,What do you do when you’re so anxious that you can’t ask for help?,"tw for brief mention of suicidal thoughts

My anxiety has always been pretty bad but it’s gone off the charts since I went on Wellbutrin for depression and fatigue a few months ago. Every second of the day feels like torture and I can’t imagine ever enjoying being alive because of the constant stress. I feel like the world is collapsing all around me and I’m disappointing everyone with my inability to function. 

I unfortunately can’t schedule an appointment with the doctor who originally prescribed the Wellbutrin since I’m now living in a different state. I know better than to go off cold turkey and I can’t ever taper off because you can’t split these pills. 

I know I need to find a psychiatrist because I’m really reaching my limit and I honestly feel like hurting and/or killing myself because of how much I can’t stand the person I am. I feel myself slipping from the ideation to planning phase even though im still not sure if I’d really go through with it. 

I need to get off this medication badly and find some coping mechanisms I guess. But I can’t imagine opening up to a complete stranger like that right now. I really crumble and panic before any authority figure, my throat closes up and I can barely speak. I can only think of the million ways the appointment could go wrong- what if they hate trans people even if their website says they’re lgbtq affirming? What if I freeze up and can’t admit how I’m really doing? What if they (either secretly or openly) think my problems are trivial and I’m just a whiney brat? What if a new medication is just worse than this? What if they try to commit me? 

I do almost wish I’d get hospitalized just so I could get more intensive treatment and get away from the real world. but as a trans person in the US with shitty health insurance I know it would probably not be beneficial. I really feel like I’m on the verge of breaking down completely at any second but I’m also trying to act like everything’s all right externally so I don’t worry or disappoint anyone. 

I want to drop out of college, quit my job I just started, and take a big break from everything but I know that I’d still be anxious and miserable even if I was doing nothing. And I don’t think I could stand the way my family would react, let alone the guilt over the money I’d waste by quitting in the middle of the semester. But at the same time I don’t know that I can get through the next few months like this. 

I legitimately don’t know how to get out of this. I want help so I don’t do something drastic and hurt my family with my choices but I don’t think I can ask for it anymore. I’ve been on three different medications and they haven’t helped. I tried therapy a few years ago and I just felt worse after every session of having to talk to a stranger about my feelings. I even tried going to my schools student health services a few months ago and they told me that I couldn’t see the psychiatrist on staff without doing 10 weeks of talk therapy with a student therapist in training (which sounds awful) and that they were were all booked up for that anyways. 

Now Ive progressed to the point that I can’t even bring myself to make phone calls or seek out a new doctor because of how anxious I am. I can barely get out of bed and my whole body aches from how tense I am. Does anyone else feel like this? Or has anyone found a way out of something similar?"

I started to get really nauseous throughout the day from the 13th December 2021 and it just hasn’t stopped, I also have emetaphobia, which kinda explains the panic,, but I get symptoms ranging from dizziness, stomach aches to the point I can’t move, migraines, and recently,, super bad period pains,, all of which are accompanied with nausea, it makes me super tired since I’m just panicked all the day and I can’t go out much because of the fear of feeling ill, does anyone have any advice or ideas to if it’s anxiety or not?"
Anxiety,Hallucinations caused by anxiety,Does anyone else feel like their body is spinning or sinking in the mattress of their bed or see patterns moving when their anxiety gets really bad? I also have auditory hallucinations of my parents fighting which also contribute to my anxiety
Anxiety,Worried and Waiting,"So I’ve been experiencing dizziness for the last four weeks. Every day. I have also had strange neuropathy throughout my body that sporadically comes and goes. I’m getting muscle twitches and some aches. But that’s about it. I have no muscle weakness or balance issues or any other symptoms for that matter. 

I Went to a doctor got blood work and it all came back normal. Waiting on my MRI Monday. Thought this might have been a bad bout of anxiety but I’m beginning to think that’s unlikely. As I’ve had anxiety my whole life and never have experienced symptoms like this. I’m an athlete and I haven’t noticed any muscle weakness or atrophy so that makes me feel better somewhat. But I’m curious, has anyone else had these symptoms as a result of anxiety, or if you did have these symptoms, did you find out it was something else? 

I’m thinking it’s MS, or a Tumor etc. can’t stop worrying."
Anxiety,Weird Anxiety Thoughts / Fear,"Ive been having this weird thoughts due to somatic ocd, like my brain tells me to unfocus my vision and that i would go crazy constantly unfocusing my vision. Also like moving different parts of my body. Of course I avoid doing this things like voluntarily unfocusing my vision but for some reason this thoughs make me hyperaware of my eyes and make me think that at anymoment i might go crazy and start doing it.

I feel like im going crazy. Does anyone else had this

What should i do to spot thinking about this? I feel pain in my eyes every time i think about this. Maybe its the anxiety…. Help"
Anxiety,Victory!,"I’m so proud of myself today. I had the worst panic attack of my life yesterday and woke up to being in incredible pain/unable to move/sensory issues (I also have ADHD) I emailed my professor to tell her I probably wouldn’t make it to class today, which made me really upset because I just want to be a “normal” college student. 

I have no idea how I did it, but I got up and went to class, purely just to spite my anxiety. Like “I DARE you to stop me, you bitch”. I participated in class and everything 🥹 I’m just really proud of myself for being able to do that. I’ve been having so many problems recently, and I really needed that win

Obviously this isn’t the case for everyone; I’m just really shocked and happy that I did it"
Anxiety,Chronic pain and health anxiety,Does anyone deal with chronic pain and (what feels like) muscle tension in particular down one side of their body ?? My fingers hurt as well as my wrists/hip/groin/upper back/neck/shoulder but only on my left side ??? Doctors I’ve seen seem to have brushed off my concerns and blood tests have come back clear so far but I’ve not been given an answer. I have been through immense emotional distress (A level exams/parents divorce/sudden death of close family member)  in the past year on top of my HA and I live alone with my severely depressed alcoholic mother who is not someone I can vent to. Everyone I speak to seems to disregard me but the pain is so real and while it doesn’t stop me going about my day to day activities I’m terrified it’s cancer or something else sinister. Before this pain I was experiencing anxiety attacks that meant I missed a lot of school however these have subsided since I finished exams.
Anxiety,someone please answer fast so I can stop panicking,"Okay so here's the situation: I woke up at 7pm last night at took my meds (300mg extended release bupropion and some vitamin D.) Due to taking a nap around 5am and waking up around 8am, I forgot that  I took Wednesdays meds already (I have a habit of forgetting to take my meds.) And this, added with brain shocks due to tapering off of venlaflaxin, I believed I had not taken my meds at 7pm and so took them, the same dose as last time with the added 35.7 venlaflaxin. This occurred around 12:40pm. 

I've realized my error, but do I have anything to worry about here? Cause right now I'm strongly considering forcing myself to vomit just out of panic. Seriously close to a panic attack over this. Please help me, am I worried over nothing or should I take steps to fix my mistake. I figure I took the doses around 16 hours apart, if it helps. 

I'll delete this within the day, just need someone advice."
Anxiety,How do you calm your anxious stomach?,"I just got back from a 24 hour travel and all the anxiety made my stomach feel terrible.
What helps you in those situations?"
Anxiety,a new meaning to ‘being scared of growing up’ *panic attacks*,"So, I have anxiety of course but my issue is when i get really heavy attacks (panic attacks). I am currently 17 and i graduate in less than a year. Everyone I know has a job or at least work experience. Everyone I know went to that one online meeting our school set every year 11 student to go to. Anyone is able to get an apprenticeship, a school job. But even the word job is a trigger for attacks.

It’s such a “pick me girl” thing to explain. I hate it so much. that in itself makes me stress about it more. Having to explain to people that the reason I’ve collapsed due to numbness in my legs and hands, on the verge of vomiting and extreme hyperventilating is because I got stressed thinking about getting a job, or talking to a teacher.

My grades have slipped, I avoid important life events, I can’t even talk to my doctor on the phone! I need a job as soon as possible and I need to ask for more help in my classes. The worse part is, I am seriously convinced no one believes me when I tell them I have anxiety. Most people don’t know because of that. But when I have an attack and I explain, I can tell and from how they treat me, like i’m a joke, that they don’t believe me and that i’m being a “pick me” person. 

The main reason why I believe no one believes me is because of how I am around people. I can talk pretty fine, to my friends, to strangers, I am very polite and get along with peoples families pretty nicely. I’m extremely bubbly and get along with everyone, making jokes. But the inevitable important aspects of my life I tremble before. Talking to teachers, meetings, sometimes even cashiers (but i’ve been really good at them). Every encounter I have is a 50/50 chance to me. If i feel nervous to a point i start breathing heavily or sweating, i avoid it. Because i’ve dealt with this for 4 years now. I’ve been to a therapist before but stopped because I thought it was gone. But the last time i was referred to a counsellor I seriously ran out the door and ran to class like a cartoon character. I walked backwards to the door while she wasn’t looking and ran. I had an attack while standing there and left before I had to be taken to the office for the billionth time in my senior life.

I’ve been taken in a wheelchair before, i’ve hidden under desks, i’ve cried uncontrollably, i skipped class. I don’t even mean to, i’m a good student, i know my manners and the importance of these things but my natural instinct is to avoid having an attack. It’s horrible. I don’t know what to do anymore, my family keeps reminding me of what i have to do before i graduate and it becomes more of an impending doom to me. I feel like all the people who do know are exhausted with me and in the end no one can help me. i want to reach out, i want to get help but i don’t know what to do anymore."
Anxiety,The Only Thing Keeping me going is the thought of my daughter without me,"The Only Thing Keeping me going is the thought of my daughter without me

At the beginning of 2021 I went into a spiral whirlwind which left me mentally paralyzed with anxiety and depression. 

I worked my ass off for almost 2 years with therapy and medicine to get better and things were improving greatly.

All of a sudden this past week I saw 1 thing. 1 thing that triggered a complete relapse. I feel back to where I started. I don’t have the energy to do this again. I’m so distraught. I’m going through the motions of life again. Living In paralyzing fear and anxiety . Always worried, always worried about things I can’t control. I can’t let it go.

Suicide has been on my mind again. I just can’t imagine anymore of this .

The only thing keeping me going right now is my 5 month old daughter. I want so much for her. I want to see her grow .

But I just can’t fathom living in my brain anymore."
Anxiety,I'm terrified and anxious about traveling internationally for the first time.,"I'm a PhD student that is ABD (all but dissertation), and I'll be traveling internationally for the first time ever (other than Canada), in the next few days. I'll be spending 2 1/2 months in Berlin, Germany to conduct my dissertation research, and I am *terrified.* I know this is something that I have to do to finish my PhD, and I want to do it so badly, but I don't know if I can. 

Every time I try to do something to get ready, including packing, shopping for the trip, etc. I have a panic attack and spiral into thinking about all of the things that could go wrong. What if I miss a flight? What if I lose my baggage? What if I can't handle being so far from my support system for so long? What if I can't communicate because of the language barrier despite knowing some German? What if I get there, panic, and can't do any of the research I need to while I'm there? I was so panicked about the idea of having to go grocery shopping in another country, I spent hours watching YouTube videos of people comparing German grocery stores to grocery stores in the United States. I also don't want to live up to the ""stupid American"" stereotype that is so prevalent, or come across as disrespectful, ignorant or rude to anyone in Germany. I just want to blend in. 

At this point, it's made it extremely difficult to be excited for a trip that I've been waiting for for nearly five years and have worked so hard to get to. My anxiety just keeps screaming that I don't want to go because I don't feel safe, and I'm scared to be doing this alone. This is all despite knowing that I'll be safe. I'll be staying with a very, very kind older (77 y/o)  German woman who hosts students all the time and that one of my professors has known for over ten years, and she has been unbelievably sweet when we've spoken. But I'm worried about overwhelming her with any questions I may have about day to day life there. I don't want to be a burden to someone who was already kind enough to open their home to a stranger. 

I've talked about these concerns with friends and family members that have traveled internationally before, and they all tell me I'll be fine, but I'm still so anxious about it. If anyone has any suggestions on how to combat this kind of travel anxiety, or can offer some words of encouragement, I would greatly appreciate it."

Anxiety,so I dropped my grandma's peeling knife down the sink drain,She was peeling potatoes and she finished and said wash it so I went to wash it. I saw a cup there so I washed the cup and then the knife. I went away for a bit to do something and came back and the knife was gone. I am really hoping I put it to dry and it didn't fall down because I'm not 100% sure bu I'm like 99% sure. I would go check but she is by the sink and I'm too nervous to go there and I'm too nervous to tell her. What should I do?
Anxiety,Please help!!,"3rd day on lexapro. I woke up tired today but then after a few hours I felt like shortness of breath. I tried not to panick, but it felt like I couldn’t take a whole deep breath. I think I ended up hyperventilating and my hands became stiff the way they do if they fall asleep. If I clenched them they’d go right back to being stiff. I called the paramedics and they checked me out. Everything was normal. My heart rate slightly elevated. Did I just have a panick attack or is this something more serious? Should I get my heart checked out ??"
Anxiety,weighted blanket,has somebody tried weighted blankets for anxiety because i heard it can help but i dont want to waste my money
Anxiety,"Crazy anxiety symptoms- brain zaps, panic attacks, etc.","This is my first post hi everyone!

SO I'm currently going through the most intense manifestation of stress/ anxiety in my life and I'm wondering if anyone can relate.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, I'm an actor and I just finished a summer contract in Maine. I was at home in LA when I got sick with a bad cold (tested for covid twice and was negative.) While I was sick, I would have episodes of pretty intense head pressure that would last 30 minutes or so. Now, I'm not a person who generally gets headaches, s this was pretty surprising, but I figured it must be because I was sick. When I started to feel better, I noticed that I was still having headaches that turned into pain at the base of my skull. I moved back to NYC at this point, and the pain got increasingly worse. I went to urgent care because I thought I might have meningitis (I have pretty intense health anxiety) and they sent me home saying I was fine. The headaches kept getting worse, and I went to the ER and got a CT scan which was normal. After I went home the headaches started to turn into intense back and chest pain. I went back to the ER thinking something was wrong with my heart. Of course, all tests came back normal. I was told that I was having an ""atypical"" migraine. A few days later my symptoms started getting better and I saw a neurologist who did an EEG and other tests, all of which were normal. He ordered MRIs of my brain, neck, and multiple areas of my spine. I was so anxious and in so much pain that I had the brain/ neck MRI early in the ER. AT this point, I was convinced I had a brain tumor, but of course the MRI came back normal. 

Since the headaches and body aches have gotten better, I've noticed new debilitating symptoms. I'll have what I can only refer to as brain zaps all throughout the day. They are a little bit different from the zaps that come with SSRIs, but almost feel as if my brain is ""skipping"". I'll feel anything from the electric shock of a real brain zap, to feeling like I'm spacing out for a split second and then I'll come back. I'll have these at times every 30 seconds are so. They are accompanied by occasional panic attacks during which I feel dizzy and faint and fear that I will pass out, night sweats, waking up in the middle of the night feeling incredibly nauseas and feverish, and occasional waves of terror that wash over me. 

I have yet to have the other MRIs but my symptoms are so varied that I'm sure this is all anxiety. I do worry though, because the brain zaps really feel like seizures. I was prescribed gabapentin, which I  have been on since yesterday and it has barely made a dent so far. I'm just curious to see if anyone else has had a similar experience, and particularly brain zaps without withdrawing from SSRIS.

Thanks for reading everybody &lt;3"
Anxiety,Chamomile,"Has anyone tried chamomile? If so, was it helpful to you?"
Anxiety,Lexatin or Tranxilium to calm a lot of anxiety quickly?,"So, basically the title. I haven't had so much anxiety in a while, and honestly I'm not having a great time.

I've looked through my meds cabinet and I have Lexatin 1,5mg and Tranxilium 5mg, both were prescribed to me a while ago but luckily I haven't had to use them recently, so I kinda forgot which one would be the best to calm myself down quickly.

I would also like to be chill tomorrow morning because of work, at least not having a full meltdown, should I take another one in the morning? I can't consult my doc until next week, already have an appointment, but until then I need some advice.

It's almost night in my country, so I'm okay with going to sleep or whatever, I just need to calm down pronto because I literally cannot stop crying, and I don't want to reach the full blown panic attack stage if I can help it.

Thanks in advance and sorry for the length of the post"
Anxiety,20F and scared I’m dying,"I’ve been having lower back cramps, also pelvic pains and cramps. The back cramps feel very similar to my period cramps but I’m not on my period. I’ve also seen a little blood in my poop about 3-4 times. First time I saw it I was constipated and it was on the toilet paper. Dr suspects anal fissure or hemorrhoid. I had bloodwork a few months back and it was normal. Dr won’t do more bloodwork. I had transvaginal and pelvic ultrasound that came back normal. I was also examined down there by my dr (both butt and vagina) and they saw/felt nothing wrong. My dr doesn’t think what I have going on is anything serious but I’m so scared it is. My dr won’t do colonoscopy because I’m 20 and he isn’t very concerned. Everyday I’m nervous and stressed. I have really bad health anxiety. What’s happening to me?"
Anxiety,How do you cope with spiralling thoughts?,"For example: I find 1 flea in my car. instead of thinking 'ok, I need to flea treat my car to prevent them coming into the house' my mind jumps to 'oh my god they will be absolutely everywhere in my house, they will have already spread and my landlord will kick me out and my housemates will be so unhappy'

&amp;#x200B;

I find a mole and suddenly am obsessed with the idea that I must have cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any tips for stopping thought processing jumping to the worst possible idea? I know it stems from my childhood - my mother would threaten me with something very scary when I did something small. For example I picked a scab on my ankle and she told me I may have to have my foot amputated if I keep doing that and it gets infected.

I would like to work on this thought process, but I'm unsure how. I'm in therapy, but has anyone got any other tips/ books/ YouTube videos they recommend?"
Anxiety,I have just realized a hospital gave me about 35 CT’s in a years time.. anxiety about cancer.,So I’ve had this anxiety of being sick somehow all my head and neck issues I was having over the span of the last two years has made me go to a hospital in Tennessee multiple times and almost every time they ct scanned me. Resulting in about 35 scans on just my head and neck alone. Now I’m having bad anxiety that I will have brain cancer or something because of all these unnecessary scans when they could have just did mris the whole time.. thoughts?
Anxiety,Looking to see if others can relate,"Life is hard. Really hard. Sometimes I wake up and am consumed by thoughts that scare me and make me feel uncomfortable until I go to bed, only to sleep for like 6 hours despite spending 12 in bed, wake up, remember the thought(s) causing distress and have another terrible day. These thoughts don’t leave. Sometimes I resolve them in a way that can make me feel satisfied with my life and my thoughts for a couple of hours, but it never matters because the thoughts will come back again soon enough. It’s as though I’m in a constant nuclear arms race, but too often I find myself behind on development. Even still, I love life, which part of me doesn’t understand how I could possibly do so with all I go through every day, while another part believes that I’m not allowed to think anything to the contrary because of how much I’ve been blessed. Some days I’m lucky enough to wake up and spend a whole day without ever thinking some of these distressing thoughts or rather never reacting to these thoughts when I have them, other times I can go weeks without issue, even though in moments where I’m at my lowest I can’t possibly imagine such a possibility. I find myself excited to go to bed at these times just because of the possibility that I end up waking up the next day without these thoughts. The answer a lot of people give to dilemmas like this is that there is something within me that I need to work through, and resolve, and then I’ll be released from these thought(s) and not have to deal with them. I disagree, I’ve thought about everything that plagues me for hours upon hours each day for literal years, coming to conclusions that satisfy me for short periods of time before I return to feeling worried. I genuinely don’t think that my beliefs towards these thoughts are wrong and yet everyday I’m still forced to deal with them. Every time I give a concession to these thoughts, room to believe that they could be right, I’m sent in a spiral down to the lowest places of my life only for me to look back later and completely disagree with the concession I had made at the start which caused this anxiety tumble. My sense of who I am doesn’t change with these thoughts, my sense of what’s right and wrong does not change with these thoughts, and yet these thoughts determine how I live my life, things I’m terrified of being true despite the fact that I in no way believe them to be the case. These thoughts that scare me are made up of things that other people have thought about me in the past. Too often someone makes an offhand comment about something that they thought that I was that I didn’t believe myself to be, only to be put into a loop of wondering if this person is somehow right and they know more about me than I do.

I know that it is healthy to question things about yourself from time to time to give yourself a healthy dose of perspective, however these thoughts I have are constant and not spaced out ever, and my answers do not change because the questions are rooted in things put upon me by those around me unknowingly. These expectations about what I am based upon how I act only serve to make me feel crazy for what I think I am since “surely these other people have some kind of perspective on these issues that I don’t”. I don’t tell people my worries because I find that the advice they give me tends to be relevant to their own experiences and yet they treat it as the only truth and the answer to my subconscious prayers, when in actuality I’ve already considered the worry from that perspective and didn’t reach an answer that felt true in any sense. People commonly say things like “You just have to come to terms with your hidden secret emotions, if you investigate further and accept that answer you will be at peace”, “Your worries are proof that you’re not what you think you are”, “If you’re just honest with yourself they’ll go away”. I’ve thought about these worries every single day of my life from middle school and now through to college. They've kept me from being able to do things, from being able to be confident in myself, and have stopped me from being at peace throughout a majority of this timespan. I have had discussions in my mind going through every possible hidden emotion I could possibly have on this issue, I have heavily considered and have at times let myself believe that I am those things that I worry that I am to see if there’s any relief that comes with coming to terms with it (no, most of the time I do this I just feel like I’m further away from who I really am, and end up kind of disappointed that I wasn’t more confident), and I promise that I have been as honest as I can be with myself on these worries, and yet they are always there nonetheless.

I'm not really looking for advice in the replies but you're free to give it, just looking to see if people have or are going through similar loops. Just knowing your not alone really helps after all!"
Anxiety,I love you.,
Anxiety,"GIVE ME SPACE: 2 minute YouTube Video for those who suffer anxiety and depression, and who need to be uplifted, and feel good about themselves. Inspirational music plays an important role in defeating anxiety and encouraging positivity. Peace and tranquility.","Hi All, I suffered depression and anxiety for the greater part of my life. It has taken me a long time to deal with it. When the ""Black Dog"" would sometimes visit me it would drive me into a deep depression . I would turn to inspiring music of the great composers. And working in media, I found certain music could help me meditate and pivot a bad mood to a good mood. I started to research this genre of smoothe music which had special qualities that could bring about calm at the same time inspire to live a full purposeful life that awaits you. It's now my turn to pay back, so I'm producing music videos to deal with sleep deprivation and traditional meditation. I'm new to Reddit and only just joined this community. I've read many letters on Anxiety and I admire the collective positivity provided to those who need help. I hope ""Give Me Space"" in some small way helps people suffering anxiety to focus on positive things that can happen in your life ahead and not the past. Stay safe and well, Somna"
Anxiety,"extremely anxious, please talk to me","Having an anxiety attack and feel extreme dread, can't get out of my head, please I just need someone to talk to"
Anxiety,My dad is stressing me.,"I don’t know why I made this, but I needed something to sort of speak my mind. 
I’m currently in college and I’m 19 yrs old. I’ve used to think that me and my dad had a pretty good relationship when I was younger. But around 3 - 4 years ago, I decided to move from my mothers house and stay with my dad and step mom. 

Since I lived with my mom for so long, I figured I’d stay with my dad, for us to be closer. 

I think I’m quite close with my dad to a degree, and he’s a very supportive person as well. But… I’m not really sure how to explain this, however, I his supportiveness can be a bit “excessive”, in a way. 

(I’m not entirely sure how to say it)

Ever since I was a little kid, he’d always give me prolonged, (maybe an hour or longer) speech’s about life. Whether it’d be controversial, sports, women, political views, anything really. Like I said before, he’s been doing this for a very extended amount of time. Which of course, I know he’s only doing what he’s being; a father. 

Albeit, it feels like he doesn’t look at me like I’m his own son at times. Almost like I’m just a literal clone of him self. 

After every accomplishment I could achieve, being in sports, school, drawing, a job or etc, he’d lecture me into doing better. Like I’m never good enough or so. His expectations are just so ample, that it stresses me because it feels like I can never just be enough.

After years of lectures, now, I just feel drained from speaking to him at times…. Hell, even being around him makes me feel exhausted as well. It’s at the point now to where I feel that I can’t even have a simple conversation with him, without being lectured. 

Now, whenever he speaks to me I kinda just listen and not indulge myself in our — or his conversations. Even when I do say something, he acts like he literally knows everything. Which he corrects me, then switches the previous dialogue into something else. 

I’m also very knowledgeable of his more — no so healthy tendencies— such as drinking, or being an alcoholic. And when he starts drinking, is when he becomes more obnoxious, aggressive, and speaks even more. I try my best to tolerate him, and now I just stay in my room. But it’s basically futile sense we live under the same roof. 

After living with him and my step mom for the past years, I’m came to understand that there’s a grand difference between living here, and living with my mother. 

I think I was more at peace living with my mom.

But here, my step mom and dad argue almost every week. And their feuds become extremely chaotic to the point that I can’t even watch tv, play the game, or even draw without hearing them cuss each other out. They had even gotten into a physical fight and I had to hold him back. 

I just feel dull, drained, and exhausted living here.

And now my dad wants me to work full time while being a full time student in college. Now, he’s never been to college before, and I explained that working full time wouldn’t be the best option. I have no qualms with working part time, but full time doesn’t seem like a great choice. 

I understand that money is a necessity that everyone needs to live. But I’d like to focus on school without stressing myself even more working full time. Other family members of mine even said that’s not a good idea, but he doesn’t listen.

I’m at a point to where I feel lost, and empty living here.

I completely understand that there are others who have it much worse than me, and I have nothing but respect to those people who managed, or are managing to live a much better life. 

But I’m getting tired, and I can sense that I’m slowly losing myself. I think that I should move back with my mom, but I know that my dad will just tell her that I’m being lazy of the sorts, although I’m not. 

I know he wants the best for me, but I feel as if he’s doing and saying all these things to kind of shape me into a better version of himself. Not exactly me as my own. 

But thank you for taking the time to read my little rant. I just didn’t know where else to turn to."
Anxiety,I feel violated and disgusting TX: Swearing),"I just need to tell it someone so i wont just suck it up again beause it is already making me feel shitty as fuck.

On Saturday i was sitting on a staircase with my girlfriend, in front of a Train Station. We were just eating our food and a guy there was constantly insuting everyone and being verbally agressive, but he never moved from his spot. on some point he threw somehting. he constantly made racist and homophobic insults to everyone around him. He was about 18-20 and might have been on drugs but idk. 

We were watching the pigeons and apparently we offendet him or something because all of a sudden he called ""ey harry potter you hoe!"" (i was wearing glasses that day) and we just tried to ignore him. he didnt stop calling me names and shit like that. then he stood up and i was scared as hell because he was angry as fuck and came over with a bottle and a bag of chips in his hand. he said ""dont look that stupid you slut!"" and i told him in english (he didnt speak english to me cause the country i am from is not english) that he should please leave us along. he yelled ""speak \*\*\*\* you bitch!"" emptied his bag of chips over me and kicked me in the side so i fell down the last few steps and doubled over. 

idk what to do now. i feel like hell and i cant get myself to chill anymore"
Anxiety,I have a fear of death,I have a fear of death and it has really affected my mood every day. I recently got this fear because randomly one day I thought of one of my family members or myself dying. And the thought of that happening stresses me out. And the fact that death is unpredictable and random also scares me. Can anybody help me with this anxiety problem?
Anxiety,Help,I am just so insanely sick of myself and tired. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel like I’ve run out of options for things that make me feel better. I hate myself and I can’t stop hating myself. I get distracted for a bit but then I always come back to hating myself. I don’t even know if it’s anxiety anymore or depression I just feel like my head is a giant mess and I have no idea what to do. I wouldn’t do anything bad or permanent but I’m just so tired
Anxiety,I use to be so social,"I use to be able to talk to anyone and be able to make people smile and I was able to have a postive conversation like nothing. Girls tended to be really attracted to me and I was able to have no worries talking to them. Now, 8 years later I’m the opposite and riddled with worries and second guessed. I don’t feel confident and feel like I’m bothering people. I panic talking to girls when I use to be stone cold. It use to be so easy now it’s so hard. Am I just over thinking it?"
Anxiety,I need some sort of confirmation/validation before I do this,"For the past hour I wrote out this whole elaborate story time of my anxiety attack that happened today to post it here and I read it and immediately jam packed/stuffed it in drafts. because now I’m having anxiety because it’s super super long (lotsss of text) and it might come off as too much or dumb/annoying in some way. It also might come off concerning and I DO NOT want anyone to worry too much because its just meant to share and possibly see what you might want to share after reading. Looking for a green light go if you feel that it might be okay (I feel like I need that with most personal decisions I make 🙃) I’m trying to avoid embarrassment and stern “maybe next time, DONT”s because there is a very real possibility someone might go that way. Please honestly let me know if that happens a lot here because then I’m not going to post it for the sake of my anxiety."
Anxiety,Time off work for burnout?,"I've experienced burnout at work before - I've been doing the same job for a while and although it's fulfilling it's quite demanding - but recently it's just gotten so much worse. This is because there's a big looming anxiety over recruitment for senior roles in the organisation which mean the company can't currently function as expected. Plus with the cost of living crisis I find I get teary every few days, I am irritable and angry, and I've stopped putting in so much effort.

I am actively looking for a new job, but I'm just so upset and anxious all the time. I've not taken more than a day off for anxiety before but I'm wondering if I should take some sick leave? I am in the UK and have passed probation so this is possible. I don't want to waste my annual leave but I don't feel productive or happy at all.

The thing is, I am currently buying a house by myself (will complete next month) and while I have an emergency fund I'm terrified my burnout will mean I won't be able to pay the bills, or I'll be stuck doing this job and then will come home to an empty house (currently live with family) and feel even more miserable. 

Does anyone have any advice or kind words? Could taking some paid sick leave help in the short term? I'd love to hear from anyone who has done it."
Anxiety,hitting the gym for 3 weeks now and it's life changing!,"I started lifting to gain muscles but now I'm gaining more than that, my confidence is sky rocketing, now I can talk to strangers without trembling, I ask the gym dudes for assistance, we shower together, I can even hold conversations on discord vcs, and I feel like I can meet random people irl without panicking, ik I'm not there yet, I'm not where I want to be, but at least I'm progressing, perhaps connecting with our bodies is the answer to SA, try it guys, it's okay to be nervous, I was nervous the first day, that's why I went there at 9 am, it was empty which played a huge part in me getting familiar with the gym."
Anxiety,anyone else feel like they have a list of health issues?,"does anyone else here feel like they just have a list of problems they need to get checked for but are to afraid to do so? i just fee like i experience problem after problem. i experience so many things and am worried whether they’re anxiety or not because i do have crippling anxiety but i also dont maintain myself, and fall into self destructive habits which i fear might cause health issues. i wrote down a list of symptoms since im planning on making a doctors appointment soon just to clear my mind but am embarrassed to list all these symptoms i think i might have.

if anyone else feels this way please let me know because i truly feel alone currently"
Anxiety,Feeling dumber since i've stoped !,"Taking couple different for anxiety since 2 years of trying none of them work .... (paroxetine, venlaxafine, lexapro,  cymbalta, brintellix).

BUT even if it do nothing for that it do feel a difference since i've stoped for cognition ? Like i feel less alert and awake without it.

Is thus normal ? :("
Anxiety,Do you have a job?,"if so, what job do you do?"
Anxiety,Anxiety over using pirated software at work,"Hi guys, so just a little background. I was first diagnosed with ocd 2 years ago when I started to feel guilty about past events, this led to me confessing about every wrongdoing I ever did. This almost led me to 
1) Lose my job

2) End up in court because I phoned the police

Eventually I got diagnosed and brought it under control. But so much can change in 24 hours when you have this disease... I have no idea why but yesterday, all of a sudden, I started to feel guilty about past events again... This time it's about downloading pirated software. I've used pirated software such as Photoshop, AutoCAD, Solidworks etc in my line of work for a long time. And now I'm having the dread that the software would alert their parent companies that I'm using a cracked version and they will come after me. I'm worried that the company will either sack me or fine me heavily. I've texted my boss multiple times but he stopped replying me... He didn't even give me a direct answer and just told me its fine. Please, someone help..."
Anxiety,I cant stop having back to back panic attacks every single morning,"It’s getting fucking ridiculous. I get them in the morning while getting ready for school, waiting for the bus, riding the bus, and sometimes during first period. I get panic attacks from being afraid I’m gonna have a panic attack. They just make me wanna cry. How do I stop them or at least lessen them? Because if this keeps up I’m not gonna have a good quality of life."
Anxiety,"Help. I upped my antidepressant dosage but I'm still very anxious, having nightmares every single night.","I think I might be even more anxious than before. I know antidepressants take time to act, but it's been two weeks already. I'm less angry and more contained, for sure, but I think I'm a bit more anxious, with horrendous nightmares every night (horror movie type thing) and physical symptoms, such as trouble breathing and restlessness. My psychiatrist is on vacation. What should I do? I'm afraid she will just keep upping the dosage or that I'm just helpless. I'll have a psychology appointment tomorrow and I can't wait to talk about how my head has been working so poorly... Does anyone have advice? I'm so tired of this. I can't take this."
Anxiety,Crohn's Anxiety,"Recently someone who was close to my mom died after having really severe symptoms that indicate Crohn's (she didn't go to the doctor until she was literally in the hospital and it was unbearable). 
As someone who has tummy troubles and told it was IBS with little to no testing except some bare minimum blood tests, I am freaking out. Could I have Crohn's and not know and could my life be at risk and I don't know? 
I'm going through some other health diagnosis' and REALLY don't want a colonoscopy if I can help it... Is there a more in depth blood test that could ease my mind? 
I hate my brain and am literally just anxious as hell now."
Anxiety,What to say to decline job?,I applied for a part time job but started feeling really anxious and cried while filling out the application (but at least managed to turn it in) and I just really don’t want to work there after that. It’s also due to other reasons like misophonia. I hope they don’t call back but if they do I don’t know how to turn them down and I figured I’d ask here since y’all’d understand how I’m feeling.
Anxiety,I feel like I'm spiraling.,"It's 4am again. I have not had a decent amount of sleep for about a week now. I feel like I'm letting everyone and everything down. I'm antsy, I'm scared. I want to feel tired and don't know why I don't. 

I've been having trouble with meds and switching up meds as they've been making me awfully sick and my doctors aren't helping. I feel like I'm delusional. I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

Send help."
Anxiety,I worry I may have undiagnosed ADHD,"I consulted with my psychiatrist yesterday, I told him that I procrastinate literally ""everything"" even my hobbies and I have short attention span. He replied me that it is caused by your GAD and it has nothing to do with ADHD. He sounds right because I don't used to procrastinate and was even a successful student back when I was a child. But I can't stop worrying that I have ADHD, I am breathing too fast and I can't sit still because of anxiety. Any advice? I procrastinate things because they are too boring."
Anxiety,Creating imaginative stories in job searching,"Having a tendency to create imaginative scenarios about a potential future job position is really frustrating and leads to many defeats.

When applying for a job, and especially after a job interview, I often imagine how my daily routing will be at the job. How I will interact with my future imaginative co-workers, and how these will become my future imaginative friends. How future imaginative skills that I'll gain will improve other areas of my life. Etc.

... And then comes the call: ""You haven't got the job, we found another."" - All these imaginary scenarios just crash and burn and leads to a feeling of depression because of so much energy put into it."
Anxiety,Talks faster when anxious,"Recently I've noticed that everytime I get anxious I start talking faster and essentially look like an extrovert in other people's eyes

I don't really think before I speak at this moment and always regret after the conversation is over for a few hours

I don't know whether I'm faking being anxious or anything but I've got rejected from 3 job interviews in a row because of this problem and I have trouble with conversations(say whatever comes across my mind without thinking)

And sometimes I just can't carry on the conversation since I blank out and I feel bad since it looks like I wasn't paying attention to them but I really did blank out and I couldn't process what I was thinking"
Anxiety,Feeling defeated,"Hey, I’m new here.  Feeling in a lonely place right now and don’t know what to do about it.  I have been suffering with anxiety for almost 10 years and although I have gotten significantly better I still feel nowhere close to where I want to be.  I am 21 and I have never gone clubbing or really partied much(I am in Australia so you can club at 18) I find it difficult to do things alone cause I feel so awkward and I feel I am being stared at, and new places terrify me.  My sister who is 3 years younger is the complete opposite and has done so much and it just defeats me, I don’t have a ton of friends because I don’t socialise much and that’s the same with my girlfriend of 5 years so we really don’t push each other to do anything social.  One of my biggest embarrassments is that my mum has been cutting my hair for years because I have this irrational fear of going to the hair dressers, I HAVE NO CLUE WHY?!?!

I know this rant is all over the place but I really just had to get it out somewhere, just really in the dumps.

Hope everyone is going okay :)"
Anxiety,Verbal communication difficulties,"I’ve had problems with verbal communication since I was 4. Because of this, I’ve been extremely self conscious about my voice and I did not have the chance to have actual conversations with people in person. A child psychologist said that I had delayed receptive and expressive language skills.

I am extremely behind when it comes to basic conversational skills, I am monotone, bland and non-descriptive. It is hard telling stories and recognising when things are funny. On the other hand, I am very good when it comes to writing. I can not say the same when I am drunk, even though the anxiety has disappeared.

I.e, someone asks me how I found the Better Call Ending, my first reaction is just responding with “good”. Very bland, maybe that’s ok, but it’s like my brain doesn’t want to think in words. My brain “fatigues”. This is probably irrelevant, but my typing speed is also extremely quick and I can think of sentences instantly, but with speaking, it’s so much slower and the pacing makes me annoyed. I end up saying “yep”, “no” all the time.

I’ve been told that I’m funny, but I genuinely have no idea why. It’s some type of inside joke, I have no clue because I’m not even trying.

My words aren’t very emotional, I’m not very sentimental, I don’t laugh at perceived jokes, I’ve been called a robot on too many occasions. 

How can I improve?"
Anxiety,I'm scared.,"I'm 18 and in a few months I'll be turning 19. I left school in grade 9 and in grade 10 stopped talking to anyone and locked myself inside my house. I've been incredibly lucky to have the luxury to be able to hide away from the world and develop a fear such as walking outside. I've become very comfortable in this reality although I feel depressed and anxious about it and about my future. I have a counsellor who for the past two years has attempted to contact me. I'm not sure what she wants but it might be a chance for me to graduate with a diploma and not a GED although I'm 18 now, which I think is looked at better by future employers and schools. I know that if I text her this comfortably reality will have to change. I still fear outside. I still have many fears and issues that make me feel so abnormal. I've never been able to succeed in anything I've tried . I've tried to get help for myself mentally but with little support to do so. I don't feel ready to take this step.

Anxiety,I’m 19 and I I find it extremely hard to even try and talk to anyone. Better I should just die now.,"I don't know, I don't even know what to say here in all honesty. I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship. Not to mention I'm high-functioning autistic, so yeah there's that...

Anxiety,Got in trouble with my boss for the first time and now I’m anxious.,"So I work in a factory doing plastic bags and packaging. I’ve been here almost three months. My boss is usually really laid back but this morning he got upset with me.

We’re allowed to be on our phones as long as we’re doing our work. I had my machine running on the lip part of the bag was coming out longer than it was supposed to. Now I’ll admit I wasn’t paying close attention like I normally do and my boss noticed the bags coming out weird.

Thankfully there weren’t too many messed up ones before it got fixed. My boss still was upset though. He basically said you’re not paying attention and this job isn’t all about sitting on your phone. You’re not paying enough attention and you can’t keep this job if you don’t pay attention.

I also normally fold up and tape a bunch of boxes and count out my wickets (metal things we use to pull the bags off the machine) when I first clock in so I have a bunch made and don’t have to keep doing it every few minutes. It usually takes me about 20 mins, not too long.

My boss never seemed to have an issue with me doing that but when he was saying all that other stuff to me he was like oh well you spent 45 mins doing this or that. I was confused because I didn’t take 45 mins.

Anyways, I’m just stressed about it. I’ve never been in trouble with him before and I didn’t get written up or anything. 

I talked to one of my coworkers about it and she said he can be short tempered sometimes and might just be in a bad mood or something this morning and not to worry about it."
Anxiety,does anyone else get this paranoid is this normal?,"(was diagnosed with gad when i was about 8-9) my gf and i are long distance and we have spoken and spoken on cam many times and are meeting irl for the first time in a few months, a few months ago she did an art commission and i went to look at the guys account idk why i was just bored and i looked at the times he had tweeted at and it was a pretty weird coincidence but  idk how to explain it but basically within 10 days my gf had 4 days off of school and the only times he had posted during school time was when my gf was off school, which the chances obviously go against and from that i thought maybe there was some sort of group trying to trick me or she was being forced to talk to me or something, it lasted about 2 weeks before i noticed he started tweeting while she was at school and had done in the past just not during them 10 days, but for 2 weeks i kept making her turn her cam on and occasionally show me no one else was in the room, put 2 fingers up, tell me personal info on myself that i told her so i knew i was talking to one person idk where im going with this but does anyone else get this worried ?"
Anxiety,Anxiety about Vape.,"Hey, I'm 21 and been vaping since I was around 18. Recently as in the past 2-3 Months I've been having shortness of breathe and chest tightness. I've had issues with this and the past and got real worried its vaping etc but then it ended up not being vaping. I don't know what to think because sometimes i dont feel it or im not paying attention to it and other times i feel it strongly. Especially when I lay down to sleep. Other symptoms sometimes include coughing/gagging and I have a sense to take a deep breathe a lot. Any others had similar things happen to them with vaping?"

Anxiety,Master’s thesis defense,"I’ve been living in a perpetual state of anxiety, barely able to step out of the house on my own for the past two years. I somehow managed to turn in my master’s thesis earlier this summer, and now my thesis defense is scheduled in 2 days. 

Needless to say, my anxiety has been acting out ever since I found out about the date, and the closer it gets, the worse I feel. It’s far from some moderate level of anxiety that anyone would feel in light of public speaking and being judged by a committee of professors. My physical symptoms are already showing, I’m barely able to eat, I feel like I’m on the verge of an anxiety attack all day every day. 

The time leading up to it is probably worse than the event itself. At this point I don’t even care if I do well or not, I just want it to be over with so I can go to bed and hopefully wake up feeling less burdened by anxiety the day after.

I guess I’m just looking for some words of encouragement or advice from anyone who’s gone through something similar, to possibly make it a little easier to survive. Thanks!"
Anxiety,Is this just anxiety and stress related symptom?,"I suffer with health anxiety, social anxiety and GAD. Since i was 17 (currently 30) i have always noticed heart palpations, like little flutters or jumps which can last few secs or a few minutes then they eventually go especially when i am anxious. When i used to play football at 17 i used to get them bad my heart was beating really fast and fluttering/jumping it would scare me but eventually would calm down after a minute or so, i never got chest pain. I have noticed exercise is a big trigger, i could be going for a long walk and i get them, football definitely triggers them and can make them feel worse for some reason, hot weather also and if i am really excited about something that can trigger them too. I have had numerous standard ECG over the years and blood tests and everything came back fine but they are the only tests i have had done. I worry because i know they are other tests that can be done and worry incase they have missed something. Can you get these symptoms even when you aren’t anxious, like a simple walk giving you these heart palpitations for a straight minute or so?!. I also have asthma i know using  your inhaler too much can cause side effects but i don’t. Anyone got any advice, maybe i am just overthinking but seeing young people die in footballer due to heart problems is kinda scary."
Anxiety,Was there another SSRI that worked for you if lexapro didn’t?,"I had a really hard time with lexapro- even cutting my 5mg pill in half

Curious to hear if anyone had this issue and made the switch to something else that helped? Thanks!"

Anxiety,it’s never what i think it is,"right now, i’m stressed about my job. i haven’t admitted this to myself, because it’s terrifying that this is my future for the next few years. it’s high stakes, lots i could fuck up. you know how it’s manifesting? anxiety attacks that my fucking cat has ear mites. there’s no indication she has ear mites. her ears are clean. she just shakes her head sometimes and grooms herself a lot. like every cat ever. what’s more, i already have a vet visit planned for a few days from now. 

in the past? it’s been my teeth. thinking my teeth are going to fall out, my gums are going to recede and im going to get an infection to the brain. 

before that? it was STDs. i was a virgin. i thought i was the mary magdalene of HIV as a 14 year old virgin. i bought $200 worth of at home tests for it. it was how i coped with the stress of living in a toxic household, and the stress of being a teenager. i projected my anxiety onto something “smaller” i could try to justify and even “control”. 

i have known this is true about myself. i know why i do this. but i can’t change it. i still fall in to these same patterns. it just sucks."
Anxiety,Can weed be used as a long term solution for anxiety?,"Hi guys- I’ve suffered with depression and anxiety for many years, and I currently take Sertraline to treat both. I have been a casual weed smoker for a few years, but recently I have been smoking almost everyday. I’ve noticed it really helps with my anxiety, it slows my brain down, and allows me to collect my thoughts and distress after the day. So my question is, is this a safe long term coping mechanism?

Of course I am aware of the physical negatives of smoking weed, but in terms of mental health, is smoking weed regularly going to ultimately worsen my anxiety?

Last week I took a break from smoking for a 7 days, yes I wanted to smoke but I didn’t experience any withdrawal symptoms.

I’d love to here about someone else’s personal experience with this problem also. Thanks is advance!"
Anxiety,Going to get cavities filled,"I'm extremely anxious. I have an appointment in 30 minutes to get 2 cavities filled &amp; I'm so nervous.

I just need to get through this for the sake of my health but I'm so anxious."
Anxiety,Blocked my boyfriend’s friends on instagram because they made me anxious,"Me and his friends don’t really get along and really it is his fault. The first things that he told me about them was that they were dumb junkies so I didn’t even think they were REALLY friends. 
When I met them they were just weird and too needy of my boyfriend. Whenever I would get out of the club to smoke and get him they would also come with (they don’t smoke) and would never just let us be alone for even a few minutes. I stopped hanging out with him whenever they would come along because I didn’t want to hang out with them. This became a huge problem. They were so offended that I didn’t really like them that they staged an intervention after I asked my boyfriend to leave a party for 30 minutes to come pick me up bc I was scared to take an uber alone late at night. (He didn’t even come because they told him he would be a bad friend if he left and I wasn’t worth it) I got my friends to come with me so I wouldn’t be alone and we got there. I was pretty mad at first but I got over it quickly and tried to have a nice night but these people would not even let me dance next to my boyfriend alone. They were always there. So I left him alone and went to dance with my friends, he was pretty mad that I did that. Fast forward a few days and a random guy masturbated in front of me at a bus stop. I got him on video and put it (censores ofc) on my Instagram. His friends then followed me (ig because they felt bad that they didn’t let him come pick me up that night) and I blocked them because I want nothing to do with them. They make my anxiety go through the roof and I don’t want them to know anything about me because I believe they have bad intentions. Maybe I’m just being crazy but that is the way that it is. They got extremely offended by this and of course confronted my bf. And of course he made me feel bad about literally protecting myself against people that make me feel terrible. Why can’t they just respect my decision of not being friends with them and move on?"
Anxiety,blood Bourne pathogens during a tattoo,"Start this off by saying that I have high functioning anxiety so if these questions sound ridiculous, I'm sorry ahead of time. My anxiety fucks with my mind alot. 

I got a tattoo 4 months ago. Ive been to this artist before and he's always cool and pretty Clean. But this time after this tattoo I got a allergic reaction, he said it was probably from the saniderm that was put on...he said he had a couple of other clients that had bad reactions to it as well. 

He used a new needle. The needles were prepackaged. He wore gloves. But I'm not sure if he cleaned the tattoo gun. He uses a portable like hand held one that doesn't have wires coming out of it. The part where you hold it was covered in the wrap that doctors wrap your arm with after you give blood. But it was the color black so I couldn't tell if it was dirty or not. He used a new ink pot as well and I watched him at the ink from the bottle into the ink pot. 

My worry is, he was pretty booked that day so there was a guy before me that got a relatively big peice. After that guy left. The artist cleaned up and I was back there...within a span of maybe 15 minutes. So my worry is, what if there was blood from the guy that went before me still on his tattoo gun. What If the artist refilled the ink pots during the session instead of taking out multiple ink pots and filling them when he needed more ink. I've read about blood being transferred into ink, so if he just refilled the ink pots instead of taking out multiple ones and filling them then blood from the previous guy that went before me could possibly be in tbe ink if the ink bottle tip touched the other ink that already had been used. I'm worried about hep c and hiv pretty much and my anxiety is driving me crazy. I rushed to urgent care yesterday and got a blood panel done but it's only been 4 months so idk if it will actually be accurate.  And I'm also worried if possibly if some blood could have transferred onto my skin if it wasn't properly sanitized. 

And yes I agree i will probably never get another tattoo after this much anxiety that I'm having. I have messaged my artist but he hasn't responded and probably won't tbh. Can anyone give me some sense of relief ? I went to the doctor and asked questions but they didn't know anything about tattoos so they were little to no help. Please don't judge me. I have high anxiety and I know all this sounds crazy."

Anxiety,I need help making friends,"Hi there people of Reddit! Thanks for reading. I (F27) have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (GAD). No biggie, I always figured as I overthink everything. It has recently been brought to my attention that I do not have any real friends outside of my boyfriend (M27). Typically this is not a problem, as I get very anxious during social interactions, but my bf insists that I need other people to talk to. He feels that I am always bothered by the fact that he is having conversations with his other friends and also has access to other people when he needs to vent. He’s also stated that it can be overwhelming when I need to vent as he is my only outlet. Overall, this has become a strain on our relationship. I can see his point of view, however I don’t really know how to make friends. It’s very hard for me to step out of my comfort zone and reach out to others. All help is appreciated."

But right now, I’m unable to do any of because my laptop that I haven’t used in weeks is refusing to start up properly. It’s an HP Windows laptop and for whatever reason after it gets past the first HP loading screen, the screen turns off and then the rest of the laptop itself.

I've seen a viral post about someone walking another through the process of ordering a Subway sandwich and that's what I need. I need to go vote today and I was wondering if anyone can explain step-by-step how it's done. I hope this is a safe space because I know this probably sounds so ridiculous."
Anxiety,Was this friend (who has a boyfriend) flirting with me? 25F/23M,"Whatever the answer is, I wouldn’t pursue anything. I’m just curious what to think of it, and it’s kinda been in my head rent free for the past few days

My friend (“R”) has a roommate (“K”) who I’ve only met a few times. The first time I met her, I told R I thought K was cute but told me she has a boyfriend. In retrospect R has a big mouth and probably told K I said that

Last weekend we went out bar-hopping and when introducing my new friend to the group, I actually blanked on K’s name (embarrassing lol) since I was a bit drunk and it’s been months since seeing her. That sparked some teasing, her saying smth like “ugh I hate you, (my name)” and I’d tease back like “alright well I hate you more”. She made those types of teasing jabs throughout the night. At some point Taio Cruz “Break Your Heart” starts playing and she jokingly yells over the music, “Are you only gonna break my heart, (my name)?”. She probably doesn’t remember saying that, I almost forgot too

Later we became separated from the group for a bit and when commenting on the drinks I owe her (for forgetting her name), she said “they can’t be green tea shots though. Not while S is here!”. Now S is another person in the group who I very briefly dated. I’m not sure why K brought her up, but it sounded like she associates GT shots with me and S, so i have to choose something else to be “our drink”…?

The other thing was she said, “the other 3 think there’s something going on between us”, I replied with “well they also thought I liked R which I never did so don’t listen to them”, and she said “no, they think you like *me*” and then I didn’t really know what to say. 

The last thing was standing really close in front of me, holding my hand and talking about her parents divorce. But I just attribute that to drunk girl behavior haha. Another thing that got me wondering is I’ve heard her boyfriend is apparently “not her type” for being “bland” whereas I’m definitely the jokester/goofball of the group. The next morning K texted me asking if I got home safe, and asked “sorry was i really bad yesterday?” and I said it was fine

**TL;DR** Felt some tension with a friend’s friend who probably knows I think she’s cute. I wouldn’t do anything, just curious what to make of it. Flirting or just drunk? Both? Just likes the attention?"
Anxiety,Does your anxiety have a clear trigger or ... ?,"TLDR please help me understand the anxiety disorder of my boyfriend, which doesn't have obvious triggers anymore. He says that he feels anxious literally all the time, and sometimes it morphes into a panic attack and nausea. It is all aggravated by depression. 

It all began when he learned that his beloved elder dog is ill with cancer. The dog died shortly after the diagnosis. In addition to anxiety my boyfriend developed depression, 2.5 months have passed since then. He got very distant. He says he can't point out the triggers for his daily anxiety now, it's just always there. In the beginning he was saying he is anxious when we are talking (he got the idea he needs to give me answers about out future together literally in every interaction we had), so I gave him space and time which he wanted, we speak every week or two now. But the anxiety is still there, I doubt I was ever a trigger. We had a really secure and loving relationship for years before the dog's illness.

Please explain me what is going on in the head when there are no triggers but the anxiety never leaves? I genuinely want to understand, I have never felt it for a prolonged time like this, and it was always reasonably timed around specific events, with an obvious reason. I really would like to hear about other people's experiences with such persistent anxiety, thank you"
Anxiety,How to regularly breathe deeply,"I recently noticed that my day to day breaths are very superficial and I would like to learn how to breathe deeply more regularly.

Anxiety,Eat more cantaloupe guys!!!,"Last night I was hungry at like 10pm, I ate a lot of cantaloupe. As i was going to bed, i noticed i was genuinely calmer than I usually was, but thought nothing of it. 

Then, completely unrelated, I wanted to give my dog some cantaloupe and googled if it was safe for them to eat, it listed a lot of benefits to giving it to ur dog so i was curious and looked up the benefit of eating cantaloupe for humans:

Cantaloupe apparently helps you sleep better! And has anti-anxiety properties due to the antioxidants! it’s an anti-inflammatory, great for your skin, health and energy. It’s a super food.

I actually did find it helped me sleep better, and stay calmer. just wanted to share! Google the benefits of cantaloupe!"
Anxiety,will i ever find peace? i really dont think ill live a long life if i stay at this level of stress.,"I have been through hell. My parents split 8 years ago and me and my brother had to deal with the direct fallout of it and i wheni turned 18 it was bad enough for me to never want to see my mom again. Skip to now, 1.5 years later and my dad and stepmom are spliting. My dad is really hurt by it and things ended very messily with my dad getting a restaining order filed on him. They both could have handled things a bit better but i still love them both. My dad does not want me talking to her out of fear of her using it against him in court somehow but i dont care and am going to text her anyways. She is my stepmom still and they both have been good to me. Things are going to end badly though i just know it. Ive never had a truely happy times in my life that last since i was a small child, things are just good for a time then everything goes to shit. Maybe it is an effect i have on people, idk. My body is constantly sore and exhausted from the stress ive put on it and hopes of getting better and calming down seem gone after this happened. I know my heart or brain will go by the time in in my 40s so idk what i even have to hope for anymore. Am i going to die? Is there hope of me ever living a normal life? I still have nearly 8 years of education left before i cen even start my career."
Anxiety,Is it possible to damage mental health beyond repair?,
Anxiety,How did you taper off of SSRIs without losing your mind?,[removed]
Anxiety,Why do i stop overthinking when at school?,"Whenever I've been at school, my overthinking stops. Because I'm focusing on other things, meeting people, hanging out etc. My brain doesn't have time to overthink but in a good way, part of me also feels like its because everything is laid out for me, I just have to do it. There is little decision making once your subjects are chosen or your school or whatever. You just turn up and work, like autopilot in a good way. Even when I came home from school it wasn't there. When I go without school for long periods it manages to creep back in and gets worse and worse.

Why is this? And what can I do to solve it without school?"
Anxiety,Panic feeling worse?,"I’ve been taking Clomipramine for severe panic and OCD and I just went up to 200mg a week ago, the panic seemed to have completely gone away when I got to 150mg but I’m still going up to see if it can help my OCD more but now my panic seems to be getting bad again? It seems like everytime I go up another 25mg I feel great for a few days and then when I adjust to it my symptoms come back again. Is that normal? Will it stop when I’m at the right dose? I metabolize it quickly so I know I can still go up a bit more."

Anxiety,How I've almost completely cured my anxiety and panic with a few simple life changes(diet),"Before doing these I was agoraphobic had a big issue with showering (did it anyway with huge difficulty I felt dizzy and crazy in there) couldn't go out for a walk couldn't meet with anyone or do anything without panicking or needing medication. I started thinking about this because every time I'd visit a doctor he'd be like: what are you thinking about/ worrying about that is causing you to be anxious and I told him that's the problem /  I'm not thinking about anything when this happens first comes the bad feeling, then anxiety then the feeling death is gonna happen then panic. He never believed that tho just kept asking the same question or saying maybe subconsciously I was processing something but I knew for a fact I wasn't.

So we all need dopamine hits and serotonin and after taking benzos (which somewhat worked) and ssris which really didn't work at all and came with mega side effects and a long withdrawal period( even more anxiety) I came across a study that talked about things that raise your dopamine. 

First was chocolate raises dopamine in blood by 2 times

second was sex or pursuing a partner raises by 2-3 times

third was relaxation techniques. raised by 1.2 times

So I began thinking of ways to incorporate these. Every time Id go to the grocery store by the time id get to checkout Id start coming up and couldn't drive, So I began buying 1 or 2 kinder surprises. The chocolate gave me a dopamine hit and building whatever was inside allowed me to focus and relax.

Never buy any chocolate with high caffeine like dark chocolate that will make the problem significantly worse for days as unlike coffee which is in and out quickly chocolate will sit in your gut for a couple days building in potency the more you eat.

after ssris I had a pretty bad pain in my stomach (probably an ulcer) and an inability to eat much with severe gerd. A drink of water or a small meal once a day would cause me to burp for hours Id also have extreme tightness and a clearly inflated stomach which made me feel like it was a heart attack. So I began drinking lemon ginger tea with every meal and every snack( antacids helped very little but did do something) for relaxation I added chamomile.

I also found I have to workout or run once a day to become tired and more relaxed as well as roll/ stretch my muscles once to twice a day or id start coming up( after ssris I found I had extreme extreme muscle tightness) I found I need to do this because after going to a missuse my anxiety was heavily improved for a couple days. I had my back done first and when it released I got anxiety because my front was so tight it was pulling me forward fighting against my back muscles making me think I had chest tightness/ was gonna die.

Keeping my food fairly bland but still tasty with a decent amount of salt but very little veggies. After cutting out all food that made my stomach go crazy I found that even a lettuce leaf on my sandwhich would cause the gerd to go crazy for hours. Also by this time the gerd was my only source of anxiety and if Id just burp or fart  a bunch it would go away.

Now the last one sex or pursuit of a partner. This is quite annoying because I needed almost constant attention for many months. I found out this helps heavily because once I was at the beach with this girl and my heart was going crazy and my stomach was as well so I sat down and she jumped on my lap wrapped her legs around me and held me into her chest and a extreme amount of relaxation washed over me. The only problem is this leads you to constantly be on bumble or tinder and meeting people so much so that it can disrupt your life. But its infinitely better than freaking out. After I had sex my anxiety/ panic would go to nothing for hours or even a day or two.

So combining all these I now have pretty much no anxiety and even when a stressful situation pops up I don't freak out. I was able to come off all medication and just keep my clonazepam in my pocket as a comfort blanket but i haven't used it in months. I can go back outside for long walks and even go water skiing. I feel like I could go on a plane as well as I'm really just back to normal and usually in a very good mood!"
Anxiety,Are these all symptoms of anxiety?,"So I was prescribed Prozac (20mg) for a combination of depression and anxiety. I’m on day 15 now but was wondering if anyone could tell me what your physical symptoms of anxiety were/are? A huge trigger for my anxiety is health, so obviously any little ache, pain, lump or bump freaks me out and sends me into a spiral. About 4-6 weeks ago I started having issues with headaches, pressure in my ears/face/right eye, a weak feeling in my right eye and dizziness/lightheadedness. I also occasionally have pins/needles or a burning sensation on my skin in random areas. I’ve just recently learned that anxiety can present itself in crazy ways so I was curious if anyone else has experienced these symptoms and can attribute them to anxiety? I’ve had tons of blood work done and a CT scan and all came back normal. My doctor gave me antibiotics just in case it was a sinus infection and I’m on Zyrtec D and a nasal spray daily  as well. So I’m not thinking it’s allergies/sinus related. Any personal experiences with anxiety symptoms would be super helpful."
Anxiety,Should I stay or should I go…,"
Ok hello, I’m a [f]42 and I’ve had a crush on this [m]46 I’ve been seeing this past month, but only in my bedroom. He’s someone I’ve known sense I was a young teenager and he’s a pretty popular guy in town. He was always in a band playing guitar and I would go to his shows through the years just because he was in the band. 

We have messed around a couple times way in the past but we were always partying and really can’t remember what all happend but I never thought he would look at me in any way more than just a fling. I never thought I was good enough for him sense he was in the band and all these beautiful women would throw themselves on him…..so I always stood in the back ground thinking I’m not good enough to hang out w/ the band members girlfriends etc. 

Anyways I would message him occasionally through the years saying how hot he is blah blah blah. Then this past month he hit me up and we get to talking &amp; him saying I was the only girl who never done just this one thing;]….he was talking about giving him head. So I said come over and I could change that lol me still crushing on him as always lolz……so this past month he would come over and hang out watch movie and We would hook up. He was teasing me the first time we had sex [this time]telling me I should swallow so I did!! I said that’s the first time Ive ever done that before and I really reallly like it!!!!!!!!!! 

The thing is he has a krazy ex girlfriend and he lives w/ her cousin and his cousins woman and kids. He wants me to keep it in the down low about him coming to see me. He said he never gets to have a private life cause someone always in his bizz. I told a few ppl we were hanging out before he asked me not to say anything &amp;I trust these ppl…..So no one else knows. Srry this post is so long but I’m really starting to have more feelings for him and I think in a way he is too but he won’t answer any of my messages now so I think I’m starting to get to “clingy”. 

Should I stopped texting him to see if he will text me first lol [feel like this is high school crap].So what should I do ? Should I keep having him come over or should I end it cause of the feelings? I really can’t see us together no way for right now anyways cause of his living situation.I have NOone else to talk to about this so that’s why I’m opening up on here. Plz help I  feel like I’m getting to old for the games…….."
Anxiety,Can anxiety cause bad memory problems?,"I was diagnosed with PTSD and GAD last summer after a traumatic event. My anxiety is still pretty consuming especially now since I’m studying for a big licensing exam. And I’ve realized my memory has gotten really really bad. For me, it’s always name recall. The name of a movie, of a famous person or even once my boyfriend’s mothers name who lives in another country (although I remembered after a few seconds). And now THAT gives me anxiety, so I test myself to see if I remember a certain name and I immediately feel the rush of adrenaline (anxiety) because I’m scared of the implications if I don’t remember it. Otherwise, every other aspect of my memory is fine. It’s always freaking names and I don’t think I ever had this problem before my severe anxiety 😔"
Anxiety,reason of my social anxiety,"the reason for my social anxiety is 
my negative self-image. i think i'm ugly and have a babyface. i'm 23 and people don't think i'm older than 16. you could say that it's maybe a compliment but i feel that people don't take me seriously and don't see me as an adult. besides that, i have a low iq. i have almost no general knowledge, can hardly find the right words in a conversation, i learn very slow and i have no talents at all. i'm just stupid and also come across as stupid :( these are the main reasons why i have social anxiety. i don't really know why i posted this i just wanted to complain a bit i guess."
Anxiety,Does anyone else go through this,"I don’t feel like myself. I’m almost to aware of the fact that i’m alive. I feel distant from myself. It almost feels like i’m trapped in my own body. I just feel like nothing matters and there is no purpose in anything. I keep randomly thinking back to when I was a kid and i don’t like it. it feels like i’m in a dream. i just want to wake up. My mind just feels like it’s in such a weird state all the time. I’m never relaxed. 

I used to have bad health anxiety and always worry but now it’s so different. I kinda feel like i don’t care about anything anymore. I never feel happy or excited. This feeling is so scary. I just want to go back to how i felt before. 

I don’t understand what this is. I also cant stop thinking about dying 24/7 every single day. it’s really bad. I keep getting a feeling like something terrible will happen to me at any moment. 

Does anyone else have this or am i losing my mind?"

Anxiety,Switching meds... advice?,"After 3 years on Effexor with no real improvement, getting more dependent on klonopin, I convinced my doctor to switch me to Cymbalta and start trying to find a medication that works for me.

Anxiety,Life,"Does anyone else have a boring life, but is ok with it? I have anxiety and I used to get mad about the way my life was, boring and uneventful. I have a wonderful girlfriend, family, good job, nice coworkers, food, etc. I don't have a car currently due to a loss in an accident but I share one with my gf. When my anxiety was bad I'd be super depressed about my situation. Im 24. I used to envy others who had eventful life and were always busy with something. But you know what? Im content with going to work, coming home to my gf and dogs, playing Xbox, playing guitar. I don't need to go far away. I think working on my anxiety and depression made me realize I really like life even if it's dul and boring, at least I have money and love and hobbies. Im not sure if this fits into anxiety but I just wanted to write my thoughts out. Thanks for reading :)"
Anxiety,Went to an Urgent Care for chest pain and dizziness,"Got an EKG and chest x-Ray but they said they couldn’t find anything. I’ve felt sharp pains in my chest for two days, and last night and today my head feels tight.

Anxiety,Can anxiety trigger physicals symptoms?,"So im an 19 year old caucasian male (175cm 73kg). I Dont smoke or do any drugs but i might drink some alcohol from time to time.

Its been more than a year that ive started getting terrible heart pain that lasts for too long. it all started after i had my covid J&amp;J vaccine (im not anti-vax at all im just pointing this out). when after 2 weeks i woke up with a squeezing pain in my chest and went to the ER. the doctors did an EKG,ECHO, X-RAY and bloodwork and they said everything was fine. the pain though didnt go away. Everyday i get this shooting chest pain multiple times a day along with crazy palpitations which make me think im constantly dying. i decided to visit another cardiologist who said that my heart was also fine but i have some arrythmias (PVC's) he also mentioned that i might have a bicuspid heart valve but that wouldnt cause any pain at the time being. (So he just gave me some magnesium)

Anyway they also made me wear a holter monitor for 48 hours which showed 500PVCS(250 per day) they said that its benign and that i dont have to worry about my heart. i also forgot to point out that there is no family history of heart disease. At the meantime i also started developing spasms. i have fascicualtions nearly everywhere in my body, the worst ones are in the chest theyre so awkward and painful. i get them literally everywhere (eyelids,legs,arms,chest,back) but at one part each time. I also get this symptom multiple times everyday its just exhausting. (thinking about visiting a neurologist as well)

ive told my PCP about this and he said that it could be magnesium defeciency, ive been taking big doses of mangesium and Vitamin D for months but nothing has changed. Ive also caught covid twice in a year and H1N1 once as well. im afraid that i have long covid or something. My bloodwork comes fine except my WBC and lymphocytes which have been slightly elevated for almost a year now. (WBC's run at 12-13k range and lymphos at 45-50). ive went to a hematologist as well, who diagnosed me with reactive lymphocytosis and said theres nothing malignant with my blood

Anyway im getting pains daily all over my body. my belly hurts a lot from time to time as does my head, back etc. I dont if covid has triggered anything autoimmune like fibromyalgia but i feel like an 80 year old man who is ready to die. I was a healthy 18year old before all that and this 1 year has been pure hell. Ive been to so many doctors but no one has helped me so far, its just so painful to live like that everyday. i have a 9 to 5 job that needs lift weights etc and each time im struggling and get out of breath very easily although im quite fit. I also wouldnt say that im stressed or anything, my life has been pretty normal and stressless these pains though that came out of nowhere and have destroyed me, any ideas what should i look into? i ve also checked my CRP, igg,igm,igg all negative. and my thyroid functions fine. the ALS/CANCER/HEART DISEASE thoughts are killing me. these symptoms are very costant like every few minutes or so, might get a terrible headache out of nowhere"
Anxiety,Waiting for medical test results,"I’m going to take a medication that was recently approved for a condition I have that would allow me to eat gluten again. To say the least, this would make my life so much easier and I also would be able to eat all the foods I miss so much, go out to eat without getting sick, live with people that eat gluten, etc. I get the medication soon and then after maybe 2 months I try eating gluten. I can’t stop thinking about it when I know I can rush it. There’s nothing I can do right now except wait to get the medicine. After that I wait for the medicine to set in for a few months. Then I finally try gluten and find out the results. I cannot stop thinking about it. I want to be able to eat gluten again I’m just so nervous. I haven’t been present and in the moment for a week now."
Anxiety,Mood feeling worse?,"I went up to 200mg of Clomipramine 2 weeks ago and I just started feeling the effects of it over the weekend, I had 3 days where I felt completely normal and amazing but now since yesterday my anxiety and mood are feeling really low again and I’m not sure if this is normal? I emailed my doctor asking but he hasn’t replied. I’ve been on this medicine for 7 weeks but I didn’t start feeling anything until I got to 150mg because I metabolize it quickly. I just am really scared because I know they always say medicines can make your depression and anxiety worse but like does this just mean I need to go up on my dose again?? I don’t want to go back to where I was before and I’m terrified."
Anxiety,cbd oil?,"i’ve tried a lot of meds for my anxiety with pretty much no effect. i’m looking into trying cbd. i’ve never been high and i don’t want to but i’ve heard promising things about cbd use for anxiety.

Anxiety,"Only just realised that I've got anxiety, and have had it all my life. Where do I start.","M35 here. I was diagnosed 18 months ago with ADHD, and just 2 weeks ago in therapy, my psychologist told me that she believes I have an anxiety problem - a significant one. 

I knew I struggled with it, but kind of figured it was normal, since I've been anxious literally my entire life. 

I've been thinking about it now for 2 weeks, and it's only just sunk in today. 

Where do I even start, guys? Meditation is a huge priority, I believe."
Anxiety,Starting Lexapro 1.5 weeks before a work trip,"I was prescribed Lexapro today.  I have been dealing with crippling anxiety for the better part of 3 years now. I have put it off and tried to ""man up,"" but it just isn't working at all. I decided that I can no longer do it, and I refuse to keep living like this.  I am scared to do anything anymore, and I feel like my life is just dragging on.  Anyways, I am excited to give this a try.  I have a 4-day work trip out of state in about 1 1/2 weeks from now and am worried about side effects.  I have been on Zoloft in the past for IBS, and it tore my stomach up to the max.  I cannot imagine feeling like this in a situation where I am supposed to be performing to a high standard.  I am so worried (as usual :) ).

Anyways, this is my first post on here, so nice to meet you all!"
Anxiety,How to start a conversation,"There’s a colleague of mine that I see occasionally, and had my friend ask for their number, cause… Anxiety.

They said sure, but I don’t even know if the person remembers me or not — since we’re in a high traffic place.

Just want to reach out and get some friends, but now struggling with what to say. Maybe it’s a bad idea.

I just don’t know how to start.

I feel like maybe just trying a boring “what’s up?”

I wanna talk about video games cause it’s an easy topic.

I feel like normal people don’t overthink this stuff so much, but my brain is fried."
Anxiety,How to stop thinking everyone is judging you negatively,"I impulsively think this in every social situation.

Anxiety,I hate kids,"My front door leads to a little concrete courtyard with a security door, and an open walkway above it. I was out putting rubbish away, heard a bunch of kids on the walkway talking about me. I was getting passed off, but I just went inside. I keep my door propped open because my cats love wandering the courtyard, and I prefer to let them out during the day. I'd barely got in when one of them launched an old smoke detector at my door, trying to get it through the gap. So I told them to f* off and shut the door (my cats got spooked, so they were already inside.) A minute later, a rock got thrown at my door. I'm alone, I have agoraphobia and it just sent me spiraling into a panic attack. An hour later, I can't even push the handle on my door withing hyperventilating and ugly-crying. All because of some stupid kids."
Anxiety,I’m just out of it….,"For my whole life I’ve been depressed…

Idk if it’s genetics, my mindset, people around, or demons in my head but I’ve always had a negative mindset to things.

Educationally, I’ve been really focused on school my whole life … straight A student, joined a band after school and now everyone sees me as “potential” or “doing something great …career wise”. 

I’ve recently graduated with a BS in speech pathology in May 2021 but I do not want to follow up with the masters as I realized I do not want to do that and basically did it because I listened to everybody else. I haven’t worked a whole year from May 2021-July 2022 due to anxiety and stutter (Is this considered laziness? As my dad gave me money every now and then and my grandpa is paying rent). 

I’m working as a case manager right now and it’s a good job I’m helping others but I just don’t have the drive at times just motivating myself out the bed, putting a fake mask on everyday etc….

I was thinking about finding another job to take care of my mental health as this job is good as I’m helping people I’m doing a great deed…but I’m just fucked up in the head right now and this job calls a lot out of me and I can’t help other people if I can’t help myself.

My mom keeps referring to clothing jobs as mediocre and I just want a job because “I need money” I don’t want a job that I have to do after work…just a job I can do at work and leave at work for now."
Anxiety,anxious about class today,"I just want to share because im feeling anxious.  So I'm starting one of my classes today in 4 hours, and it's a class that teaches you how to Mig weld.  For those of you who don't know exactly what that is, it's a form of welding uses electricity.  I took a basic welding class a year ago and every class I would nearly have an anxiety attack because I  thought I would be injured or die.  My professor was wonderful and went over everything with me and reassured me I was in a safe learning environment.

I got shocked while doing another form of arc welding and have felt anxious ever since then about welding.  So I just feel super intimidated and I'm trying to keep a positive attitude.  I'm hoping I can make it through these next 15 weeks without freaking out during class.  My friend gave me his welding gloves as like a good luck charm.  I don't even want to be a welder, I just need to pass this class for my degree."
Anxiety,PLEASE just help me calm down,"I have had so many things going on recently. Too many to go into great detail but essentially I've been having major health problems but doctors can't figure out why, my boyfriend broke his leg and I had to take care of him for 2 surgeries, he's still out on workmans comp, I am having relationship troubles with my mom, always have been but they've been especially bad since my divorce and dating again, I just was in a car accident a few months ago, and finally got my car back, and now my already toxic job cut back my pay 2 dollars an hour and cut me from salary to 4 days a week. So I'm out 200 dollars a week. I was already living check to check and now I'm struggling to pay my bills. I haven't told them I'm quitting yet. I accepted another job and felt so great about it, and set a start date for august 31. but a week went by, and I'm supposed to start tomorrow, and mind you I just recovered from Covid as well, had it all last week. I've had such bad feelings about taking the job and I've been in turmoil. I've cried all week and had panic attacks and chest pain. So I called another job I turned down originally and asked them if they'd still take me.  They said yes. I thought I'd feel better by doing this and making the best choice. But I'm still having wild anxiety out the wazoo. I am out of my Xanax right now, but I hardly take it because my boyfriend doesn't like for me to take it.  He says it makes me act like a zombie. I am so high on edge I feel sick and in pain and in misery. Someone please help me. How do I get better, what do I do?? I am at my witts ends. I am out of strength. Please help."
Anxiety,Just had the worst anxiety attack ever,"Woke up at 4 for no reason but to start shaking, then I started getting nauseous, so I threw up absolutely nothing.   
Throwing up on an empty stomach feels so weird. I did this 7 times and now I’m having the worst stomach pain I’ve ever had… started crying afterwards.

 What’s makes it worse is that I’m on my period. My body feels so weak. I feel so tired. Thanks to that I skipped school. Seriously, fuck this. I keep shaking so much. Thanks, anxiety!!!"
Anxiety,Anxiety and Menstrual Cycle?,"What is wrong with me? I have untriggered anxiety AFTER my menstrual cycle, not before.  What the heck is going on?  What types of questions should I be asking to get to the bottom of this?  I take Effexor daily for GAD, and it works fine most days with the exception of the days following my menstrual cycle.  It is the weirdest thing, and I am now just annoyed by it."
Anxiety,Paranoia anxiety,"I feel like I’m always being watched, and people are out to kill me. When I’m at home or out in public I’m always on “guard” looking around all the time and my heart rate is always high. I get so much anxiety that I feel like throwing up. I can’t even sleep at night anymore cause of my anxiety. I would appreciate advice on how to deal with this."
Anxiety,I feel like Im losing the battle with anxiety,"It doesn’t matter how hard I try to be normal, I feel im never going to be normal again🙁. Currently trying to sleep but when I close my eyes my stomach all the way to my chest start to feeling weird and I just can’t sleep. I don’t want to live like this forever🙁 thanks for listening"
Anxiety,I am really struggling and finding it hard to reach out to anyone.,"I just need to vent. I feel this huge wave of embarrassment come over me whenever I think of something I’ve said or done in the past. These memories literally make me tense up and say out loud “I am so stupid” or something along those lines. I keep thinking that all these cringey interactions I’ve had are why I don’t have many close friends, and I’m really beating myself up lately about it. To the point I don’t even want to be on social media, text my friends, see them, etc because I’m just so afraid I’m going to do something cringey. 

On top of all this I’m having some issues with my heart and blood pressure and it is boosting my anxiety. I get blood test results on Wednesday but until then I’m just waiting. It got so bad Friday night I had a severe anxiety attack, called an ambulance and went to the ER. Of course, I felt embarrassed halfway through the ambulance ride as I started calming down and realized I wasn’t going to die. I felt like I wasted the paramedics time and space in the hospital for someone who probably actually needed it..

I feel totally lost and don’t know what to do. I’ve been in therapy for a couple years and never really brought up how debilitating my anxiety can be because I thought I had it under control for a while. I guess not. Yesterday my therapist told me she doesn’t like how I downplay my anxiety by saying “it’s just my anxiety” to everything I worry about and it hit me hard. She told me anxiety is a problem and affects quality of life more than depression does. Idk. I’m just so sad."
Anxiety,Barista made a rude comment about me to my friend,"Forewarning: really long rant about a really small thing. 

So today I went to a cafe with a friend of mine where neither of us had been to before but I chose to check it out because it had really good reviews; I like to go to places I know have really good service because I hate interacting with strangers who have a bad attitude (who doesn't) because I find it hard to not take it to heart (I try to constantly remind myself it's them, not me, and none of it matters in the grand scheme of things, yada yada but you know, easier said than done). 

So I thought it would be a non-issue seeing as the cafe had a whopping 4.8 stars on Google (out of almost 200 reviews). The barista that took our order seemed friendly, helpful, and my friend and I made small talk with him about work as we are also both baristas. After getting our drinks and sitting down, I mention to my friend that I really don't like the drink I got (she tried it too and didn't like it either) so she offered to tell the barista and see if maybe he could make me a new drink because I honestly hate to be a ""Karen"" not knowing how they are going to react to my request. She gets me a new drink, we have a fun time chit chatting at the cafe and leave.

Later on, after we left, the topic of our visit to the cafe came up and I told her how I thought the barista was nice, but she went ""I don't know, he kind of gave me the impression he looked down on us and made some rude remarks."" When I asked her to elaborate, one of the things she told me was that when she got up from our table to ask for my drink to be remade for me, he obliged the request but went ""what, she couldn't even ask for her own drink to be remade"" under his breath but still loud enough for my friend to hear. After hearing my friend tell me this my heart kind of dropped for a second. I thought the guy was totally chill and we were all friendly to each other so why  say something like that? I tried to justify it and asked my friend if maybe he was messing around or something (idk) and she said no, he definitely meant it the way it sounds and his manager who heard the interaction even said ""dude stop"" to the barista. 

Anyways I know typing a novela about such a small interaction that I didn't even witness myself is so ridiculous but I hate vocalizing things like this to the people in my life because I feel like a burden and so silly. It honestly fills me with so much anxiety whenever I experience things like this because I can't understand it and I felt like I didn't deserve it; personally, I'm never rude to people even in passing and especially not at work to people I'm serving and especially because it was unwarranted. Like dude, have a little compassion, what if I was occupied with something at our table and couldn't get up to say something? Or what if my friend is just kind and is willing to be a ""Karen"" for me? I could get behind saying something like that if my friend and I were being impolite or inconsiderate but that wasn't the case at all. When I gave him back the drink I didn't like, he even said ""haha it's okay, it's usually a hit or miss"" so later on hearing what my friend told me made me feel even worse.  

Tldr: barista probably thought I was being a wuss or lazy/entitled etc. for asking my friend to have my drink remade. Idk but being judged about something so miniscule makes me ridiculously anxious and weighs heavy on me and you would think that you just have to get used to people being a little passive aggressive but it never gets easier for me and I feel so defeated because I feel like things like this are nowhere near the most anxious, depressed, or beaten down I have ever been so why does it have so much control over my emotions?

I guess some days it's easier than others to just tell myself that sometimes people are dicks about stupid things and that's just life and so what if some random guy at a cafe thinks I'm stupid or stuck up or I don't have the courage to speak up for myself. Or maybe my friend somehow misjudged him. In any case, no matter how much rationalizing I try to do it doesn't seem to ease my anxiety about it and the only thing I can do is try to forget about it. Changing your mindset about people's perception of you and how much it really matters doesn't happen overnight after all, but it really doesn't feel like it's getting any easier even after the years of improvement I've made with the crippling social anxiety I dealt with as a child/teenager. Can anyone relate at all? Or am I being a silly goose /rhetorical"
Anxiety,Can't Sleep b/c I Need to Confront Daycare About Sleep,"My daycare let my babies sleep with blankets, and I'm going to confront them seriously. I'm terrified. 

I know that my kids safety is paramount and that's why I'm confronting them at all. 

But I am shaking just thinking about it. This lady is a older person who raised their kids during a time where safety was very different. She seems to have a lot of survivor bias. 

I'm also worried that I'll be freaking out about whether or not they're actually doing the right thing when I'm not around. Unfortunately, I have no other options."
Anxiety,What do I do,"I have bodywide twitching and something called central vertigo and it hit me suddenly after trying a medication years ago. It set off a really bad health scare for me for many months and I started experiencing anxiety + panic attacks after I was getting no answers. I've learned to deal with it better though It's always there and randomly it gets worse at night every few months. I feel ""off"" like my brain isn't fully there and my eyes start shaking worse than usual. I really try to watch my breathing because maybe I'm hyperventilating but it doesn't help. I stopped bringing it up to doctors because my testing is pretty normal so I've always been diagnosed with anxiety. I'm so frustrated living like this but I don't have any options. Benzos calm me down about worrying over it but doesn't help the symptoms at all.

I have my next physical on Tuesday and I'm wondering if you guys think it's worth bringing up to the doctor again or if it's just heightened anxiety like they say. I'm called a hypochondriac often but there was a point in time where I felt like a normal person and it's like a flick of a light I changed after trying that medication. Does anyone else deal with diagnosed health anxiety and do you feel relieved with annual testing?"

I am unsure where it is coming from…I mean I went out with friends yesterday night, but i didn’t drink any alcohol. 
Anyways, i woke up with the urge to puke, my heart is beating so fast and i can’t seem to find any inner peace or rest. My thoughts are spiraling about all the things in my life that i regret. 
Do you have any tips to come out of it? I usually just suffer until it’s over, but i feel like i am dying to some degree right now :("
Anxiety,"Anxiety and buspar, weird side effects.","I got diagnosed with bipolar around 4/5 months ago, and since then I’ve been prescribed lamictal and welbutrin which have absolutely worked wonders for me, my anxiety however has not improved very much. Right now there’s a lot of change and stress happening in my life so my doctor prescribed me buspar. It’s only been a few days but I keep getting crazy hot flashes. Has anyone else experienced this? I read that this may be common among anti anxiety meds but because I have anxiety, I have anxiety about the meds lol. I always feel anxiety in my chest, and I’ve gotten better at identifying it and trying to sooth myself but it’s gotten pretty unmanageable and I just want this work. Getting hot flashes in 105 degree weather sucks. Any experience someone may have to offer would be much appreciated."

Anxiety,Intrusive thoughts,"Does anyone else when they are having a bad theme and struggling with ocd feel like paralysed. I feel like I can move because if I move it’s going to trigger more thoughts and then I’ll be more anxious.

Anxiety,"Can’t yawn due to tight head, neck, other muscle. So can’t sleep because can’t yawn.","I sometimes experience this, can’t sleep unless I yawn, but can’t yawn because of tight muscle.

Anxiety,Leg pain and difficulty walking,"Hi everyone,

Over the past 7 months my GAD has gotten progressively worse. Recently my brother in law passed away and with it a whole host of physical symptoms have manifested.

The most worrying one though has been body pain. In particular the legs and feet. It feels like walking and standing are in manual mode, I feel uneasy when walking and constantly making small corrections when standing. My brain is convinced I have motor neurone disease as my hands are also experiencing tension and mild pain. Paracetamol did nothing and sleeping is not at all restorative, even if I get a full 8 hours.

I have a GP appointment in a couple of days but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this as a result of anxiety? It's terribly taxing on my body and mind."
Anxiety,I just want to die,I'm so done. It's 4 am and I still can't sleep. Anxiety is ruining my life. I can't take this anymore I'm gonna end it all.
Anxiety,Meds help?,"Not sure if this is allowed here but I posted on antidepressants and got no help so sorry beforehand if it’s not.

Mainly aimed at people from UK because of how different it is to be prescribed something here than in America from my own personal experiences and what I’ve read on here.

This is going to be long so sorry.

I’ve suffered with depression since I was around 15, I’m 27 now and although it’s a bit of a crutch I can sort of handle it 90% of the time but over the past year or so I’ve gotten anxiety, too. 

I’ve had the same amount of anxiety as the normal person and only would be anxious to do things you’d expect to be anxious about but since the past year I’ve had it constantly and to the point of panic attacks. November 2020 I lost 2 of my uncles within the space of 5 days and I found one of them dead in his house, I was close to both so it impacted my mental health slightly but I was getting through it, then in the following February my father died and I had to give him CPR suddenly at our home, I was in shock for a few months I guess until I went to a therapist with my mum for moral support for her and then I myself had a panic attack. Since that day I’ve been anxious and would have panic attacks here and there and I would try to control them but getting used to it all is a massive step that I’m struggling with.

I was on meds pre covid for depression but I’ve stopped a few months ago due to various side effects. I was initially on Sertraline and went up to 200mg, I felt good on them but I put on a lot of weight and I wanted to stop them to try something else to which my gp recommended Fluoxetine, again I went up to the max dosage and I still gained weight but not as much as Sertraline however on these I just felt numb to everything and just felt like a zombie so I stopped them, too.

Recently my mum was having tests to see if she had cancer so my anxiety went even worse and I was given a short term small prescription of Diazepam in case of panic, they help but I know benzos can be super addictive and you can get a tolerance built quickly so I wanted to avoid taking them as much as possible. My mums test came back and she’s in the clear so that was a massive weight off my shoulders and I didn’t need to take any of the Valium which I was proud of myself for but I do carry one in my wallet wherever I go as a bit of a safety blanket.

Yesterday I had my first panic attack in a while and I took the tablet which I’m beating myself up over now because I didn’t want to have to get to that stage but it’s made me feel like maybe I need to give the gp a call and see if there’s any antidepressant I can have that will be helpful for my anxiety.

My gp is quite open when I’ve asked for specific ones in the past so I’m wondering if there’s any I should look into trying, I really want to avoid any that are common with weight gain as that’s one of my biggest struggles with these meds.

Sorry for rambling.

Thanks"
Anxiety,Does watching dark/negative content trigger anxiety?,"I watched true crime YouTube, murder, etc everyday. My mind feels fine, but my body experiencing anxiety related symptoms. Tight muscle, can’t sleep, can’t yawn etc."
Anxiety,Can someone please talk to me?,"I lost in here a lot and it’s super embarrassing. I’m having horrifying rabies health anxiety (I hope).
A month ago I noticed two small dots on my hand. Rinsed them with alcohol and that’s when the freak out began. The past month I’ve been having a tingling in my hand which I know could be explained by anxiety. Everyone in my life thinks I’m insane. I have fully convinced myself I got bit by a bat in my sleep and it got out of my house (well, basement. I live in a basement) before I noticed.
For the past week I’ve had a headache. Never any fever. No loss of appetite. No vomiting. Really, I’ve felt fine aside from the headache. Tonight it went away, and here I am at 4 am unable to sleep. I can’t help but wonder if this is the end. I don’t know what to do, my entire body feels like it’s on fire and I’m absolutely losing my mind. I feel like I need to reiterate, I never once saw or heard a bat in my home. I’ve never even seen a bat around my home. The closest I ever saw one was  over a mile away off campus. Someone please help."
Anxiety,Buspar / Buspirone withdrawal?,"So I was prescribed Buspirone 5mg 3x a day on July 7th. I was directed to take it ""as needed"". After researching, it looks like it doesn't work that way which was evident by the side effects I experienced. I wasn't taking it at random however, I would take one every day when I woke up (with food). I noticed in this trial period I got angry super quickly and it actually triggered more panic attacks and made me feel spaced out / fuzzy. Not so much memory loss but like I was in a constant dream state. That being said, I stopped on July 15th all together.  


So my question now is, would 8 days of semi-regular use on such a low dose trigger withdrawal? A little over 2 weeks later I've been having relentless headaches / pressure feeling, my neck has been stiff, I still feel a little spaced out / fuzzy and occasionally my anxiety flares up WAY more than it used to for zero reason. I have a follow up appointment in a few days so I'm just curious as to what you guys have experienced."
Anxiety,monkeypox,hi im freaking out ab this. i flipped out during covid but i didn’t have a job so i could be pretty isolated. i work as a receptionist at nail salon and idk if i should quit because i need the money. i can’t get this because it will mess up my travel plans for school. im studying abroad will that get shut down? im a germaphobe and i’m so scared. im scared to see anyone but i’m so isolated.
Anxiety,How to get over the fear of being alone/feeling unsafe in my own body?,"My fear stems from medical PTSD I developed in 2019.

It has exhausted the tiny support system I do have, pushed away partners, and stopped me from doing what I want to do the most: travel and/or move to a new city. I want people to be gentle and safe with me in those moments but now they often get upset because they are tired too.

Part of me is so tired of trying to better myself and get over this stuff, and maybe just exhausted from it being hard, but I don’t want to give up still. 

I want to be able to self soothe more effectively, and be able to have better judgement in a moment of distress or if I’m worried about something medically. I don’t want to mentally rely on others.

The funny thing is, I actually do better mentally and have better judgement when I’m on my own anyways, and find I get more anxious with other people- yet I want them there. Even though sometimes my judgement has even been the right call over others.

What can I do? Where do I start?

PS- I’m already in talk therapy!

Thank you!"
Anxiety,Can’t sleep becasue of sleep anxiety.,"I’ve been a very anxious person all my life and recently sleeping has been as close to impossible (and feels like torture). 

Every time My eyes are closing I jump out of the bed feeling like I am dying or that I’m having a heart attack. I’ll be short of breathe or my heart rate will be high and I’ll feel heavy. Regardless, it feels like every night I am doomed and the sensations I get never feel the same so it always feels new and terrifying. I’m very fortunate I’m in good health but These sleepless nights are wrecking me. 

I’m just trying to sleep but idk if I’ll be able. Pls help"
Anxiety,I swear give up so bad I'm so tired I don't sleep at night thinking im going blind but I'm told I'm not by doctors can't focus on anything but my eyes smh,
Anxiety,Can anxiety cause random chest pains?,Off and on today I’ve had some chest pain that comes and goes after a second. I don’t think it’s heart related because I had a ekg and chest X-ray done a few days ago and they were normal.
Anxiety,SETRALINE and Migraines,Has anyone experienced severe migraines while on sertraline? Ive been on it for like 5 months but just recently i been getting terrible migraines and idk if its the sertraline or what😭😭😭😭
Anxiety,Voices in my head,"Another week has come and gone. The voices in my head keep reminding me that I am not strong. Family, friends all around tell me to keep pushing through because it will get better but the voices in my head tells me I'm a failure.

Tomorrow I go back to work. 8:30 - 5, I sit at my desk listening to people telling me to not think but do as I'm told. No context or guidance, I question my purpose at this job. Is this the right career or am I just wasting away with the voices in my head telling me I'm not good enough, useless and slow. 

Slowly but surely, I feel like I am becoming a person not worth listening too and my voices in my head are spewing negativity when all I want is just someone to acknowledge my emotions and hardship, wrap me in their arms and let me cry my pain so I can get better and not stay in this state."
Anxiety,Propanolol,"This one will be the latest drug to try and curb anxiety symptoms. We are trying to wean me off of taking klonopin as a maintenance drug. We have also tried almost every ssri and snri. My concern with propanolol is I have a really low resting heart rate and low resting blood pressure. Will it affect me more if my resting rate is usually sub 60 bpm?
I try not to look at the side effects so if I feel something it’s genuine and not in my head."
Anxiety,Talking to people is hard..,I have a job that involved talking to people 8 hours a day 5 days a week on the phone and that’s hard enough tiring me mentally and physically but I had people trying to speak to me on my day off when I was out and I almost started crying and having a panic attack it’s too much
Anxiety,Feeling bad,"i might of developed health anxiety a few weeks ago, after trying out the gym for a week i had an episode or something where my heart was hurting a bit and the i nearly fainted, after that i just kept gettin dizzy every time i tried to workout without the heart pain, i went to the er they checked my blood, heart, chest. i was fine it eased my anxiety a bit but its back, im at home i feel like i have shortness of breath, random 1 seconds aches from time to time, and im terribly tired even after i slept for 8 hours like i have no energy, my head feels foggy. Im really tired of it and i keep thinking something is wrong with me. i do have vitamin d deficiency but im not sure if thats the only thing affecting me right now."
Anxiety,Sudden thought made me anxious,"I was mastrubating imagining my girlfriend and when I was about to orgasm I suddenly thought my friend with her.

Now I can't shake of this thought and feel anxious all the time what if this thought again come to my mind while mastrubating or while having sex with her.

I tried mastrubating, my friend did show up but I tried to supress. 

Would I able to get this thought out of my mind completely? Any help for this.

Me and my girlfriend are close and she is loyal to me its just this sudden thought and I totally disgust this thought."
Anxiety,"Anyone else feel this daily, just another anxiety/stress symptom?","Everyday it’s like i feel a tight band around the back of my lower head/neck. When i go out in public my head feels really heavy and especially when i look left and right makes me feel a little off balance and dizzy. If I move my head too fast right and left it automatically triggers my anxiety and it hits the roof and i start to feel really lightheaded and shaky even if i aren’t worrying about out. Must be the pain my head is feeling in that scenario. It’s like I feel it daily, my sleep isn’t bad but it’s great, I drink allot of water but i also game allot and worry and get stressed allot. Hate feeling this way most days."
Anxiety,Set your intention,"Happy Sunday /r/Anxiety! 

It's everyone's favorite day of the week... Sunday, the last 24 hours before Monday rears its head again. Let this thread be a space to set your intentions, share your goals and concerns, or just to check in, about the week ahead."
Anxiety,Had anxiety for the first time in a while,"I suffered with pretty severe anxiety last year. I was jobless, was recovering from the lockdowns, had no friends, and was in a failing relationship. 

The worst was from like June-August when I pretty much had bad anxiety every single day all day. I could barely eat and was extremely exhausted all the time. 

But thankfully I have a supportive mother who gave me some tips to help, and then I went to a therapist. Since then I have really learned how to handle my anxiety.

I've been in a better position in life as I am now in a happy relationship and have more of a social life and some direction, so that has obviously helped a lot, but I honestly just don't get actual anxiety much anymore. I stopped getting it around Feb/March this year I believe.

I still have ""anxious"" thoughts sometimes or worry about becoming anxious, but I don't generally get full on anxiety. 

However recently I've been feeling a bit shit. I don't want to go into why, but I've been feeling a bit trapped and slightly existential. 

Last night I went out drinking and in the past drinking used to give me really bad hangxiety. Luckily it hasn't much this year, but this morning I had it. I honestly can't tell if the way the anxiety reminds me of my past is worse than the anxiety itself.

When I started getting it it gave me that horrible dread and fear of it never ending that I once experienced every single day. I forgot how terrible that can be.

Luckily I was able to get myself out of it and I'm so grateful that I've learned how to do this. I find that getting up and doing stuff usually helps a lot. I got up, used the bathroom, got some water, got a snack, etc.

I then turned on my comfort show that I only watch when I'm anxious - Friends. I lay on my back cuddling a pillow as that position makes me feel the most comforted.

I text my mum telling her I'm anxious cause I find even just doing that gives me comfort even before she responds. I close my eyes and listen to the show and I end up falling asleep pretty fast. I then wake up like 25 minutes later with pretty much no anxiety."
Anxiety,Therapy,I have recently just started therapy and I’m wondering if anyone else can relate to this. I’m worried about discovering who I am without anxiety? Like I’ve put my life on hold for 10 years and now I’m starting to receive treatment I’m really scared
Anxiety,Woke up to a panic attack I think?,"I hate it. It’s 4:40 am, I woke up because it’s hot and I believed I came down with a fever (only because I had a stomach bug or 24 hour flu about 3 days ago). I go to check it and I’m at 97.0, my stomach starts hurting and I start to feel that whole “my lungs are shutting down on me” sensation all over again. My stomach hurts a bit however when I go rub or put pressure on it I don’t feel much of an ache or any form of that. I felt nauseous (again thinking I had a stomach bug pt2) so I went to the restroom prepping to vomit but all I’ve done is nothing but burps. 

Im not sure if my anxiety has caught up to me on being scarred by the bug that I recently had. I am petrified of vomiting so when I did I felt ok and didn’t give it much thought. In fact, I was actually surprised I wasn’t having panic attacks with the whole throwing up thing but now? Well now I feel like my anxiety is playing yo-yo with my sensations and it sucks. I have to be up by 8:30 for work and this is what I get 🤦🏻‍♀️"
Anxiety,Help! I have anxiety every time I try to read something/study,"Every time I try to sit down and read the material for my exams, I have a bad stomach ache and my mind starts wandering and I start thinking “I don’t understand any of this, how am I going to pass this exam”. I start thinking about the how hard the exam is going to be and how I’m not going to get a grade that is ‘good’. I just want to know how to overcome this painful sensation in my stomach every time I try to read something and how to overcome these thoughts so I’m able to properly focus."
Anxiety,This is scary bad right now.,"I'm doing so bad right now, but this has happened before and I'm pretty sure this is just extreme anxiety or a panic attack or whatever. 

I've had a casual night, just talking to friends online. Then this hit out of nowhere. My heart? hurts. My brain has completely shut off, so apologies if this makes no sense. I feel like I legit need a Life Alert and I'm young and healthy. My left arm is super numb and weird feeling. Same with my left leg. This has happened before. No idea what brought it on. I'd love to go to the hospital if I had $1000 to burn. But even if I did, they'd just tell me to take ibuprofen and send me on my way. 

Super nauseous. My back is all tight in sporadic places. My entire body is vibrating. I'm half-waiting to lose my peripheral vision. I'm alone right now and I really don't want to bother anyone at 7 a.m. on a Sunday morning. I have a text prepared to hit send if it gets a bit more dangerous feeling. I can't talk. My teeth feel locked in place, but I'm able to drink water and I'm trying to force down yogurt. 

Everything is shaking and my vision is all weird. My entire body is vibrating. My head hurts in many different places, like on the inside. I feel like I can feel my brain inside my head, and I can't stop ""holding my head together."" But I'm trying to just breathe slowly, in and out, and drink water.

I don't know what to do. I can't think. I don't know if I need silence or if I need a distraction or if I need actual medical care. But I'm so used to some level of 24/7 anxiety, I'm sure this must all be in my head. This time it's just really scary feeling. Whole left hand is numb now. 

Luckily, my friends who I was talking to are checking in on me and know who to call if I don't respond within 5 minutes, so that's comforting. Crazy heartburn. Every little noise is so incredibly loud and I can't help but jump at them. I can't type anymore. This is wild."
Anxiety,Does anyone feel a bit worse after missing a few meds and then catching back up?,"I missed two doses of my SSRI over the last two days. I took a single dose last night. I’ve been nauseous and feeling on the brink of a panic attack for over 12 hours now. But I keep reading that taking a dose after missing doses usually helps people feel better within like, an hour. 

Just curious if anyone else feels worse before they feel better after missing a few pills?"
Anxiety,My ex was abusive but i cant stop thinking of her," 

So i (m20 from Denmark) was in a long distance relationship with a girl from England (f19). It lasted a year. the first 6 months were pure bliss and ive never been happier. We would talk for days without end and do all kinds of fun stuff like play Minecraft, show eachother our intrests (her in jewellery and me with movie) and it was great. But after we saw eachother at christmas it started going down hill. She became more and more jugdemental and would never show any love. id read her harry potter almost every night, put on whatever show she wanted, help out when she was drunk in the middle of the night. But when i needed anything she would always make it a fight. one time she was sick for 2 weeks and id come how from work every day and tend to her. the week after she got better i got sick, but she just ended up saying she needed to study and preseted to ignore me while i was sick. id have panic attacks over past trauma and she'd just pretend it wasnt happening even do she would have the same and id drop everything help her. it ended a month ago and i cant stop thinking about her even do i know she was cruel to me. we called the other day and she told me about having sex with another man and it made me feel horrible. Also i see her slipping and it makes me feel so fucking sad, beacuse she tells me she doing Ketamine like its normal. I also helped her with her massive fear of anything sexual but 2 weeks after we broke up she goes and hooks up with a stranger after not wanting to have sex unless it was for her for 2-3 months

I just got a P.T.S.D. Diagnosis from all this and i dont know what to do Basicly, how do i stop thinking about her 24/7 and just move on"
Anxiety,I micro dosed on an edible last night.,"OMG.

I’ve been dealing with insane anxiety and depression for months. I broke down last night and bought some edibles from the weed store. I haven’t tried weed for probably 15 years.

Wow, wow, wow!!! I had my most anxiety free, depression free and pain free night last night. I got the best sleep in months. I woke up feeling so relaxed. 

I cut my edible up and made sure to start small. 

It was such an amazing experience. Just wanted to share."
Anxiety,pretty anxious because of my finger,"2 days ago, my fingers got trapped into a heavy door (a wooden door to be exact, i'm pretty sure the kind of wood is known as heavy here in my place) because of my clumsiness in which of course, led to minor concussion. i was downstairs as it was evening and everybody was asleep, so i have nobody in my assistance and did the first aid on my own. i compressed my finger with some ice and slowly relaxed it. the pain went away slowly (though i can still feel it whenever i put pressure on it) so i wrapped it with a band aid.

on the first day i removed it, my finger was okay. now for the second day when i removed it, the portion of the finger got pale and somewhat yellowish. i know it may be because of the lack of blood circulation in that area and i think i may have applied the band aid this time a little too tight, which cause to it. this is not my first time experiencing this however what i'm worried about is because the band aid's been on my finger for 24 hours, and I'm worried about the blood not being properly circulated for 24 hours. i don't have anyone right now since my mother's away from our hometown and my dad works outside the country, both of them are in a stressful situation so it's the best not to bother them anytime as of now. i live with my cousin and grandfather but as this moment, they are out of the house and i am also emotionally distant to them, so i don't have their phone numbers. i tried to research but I couldn't find any right words that describe the condition this english is not my first language. my anxiety over small accidents is crazy and i go paranoid over the smallest things.

i'm just pretty anxious about the circulatory, will i be okay, or will my finger be okay?"
Anxiety,Do you cringe a lot?,"I am curious if the overwhelming cringe when seeing others in cringe worthy situations or even seeing a bad movie has something to do with anxiety, or is it just me."
Anxiety,My husband is going to a concert tomorrow and I'm worried he'll catch monkeypox and bring it home.,"This might sound unreasonable but he's going out of town tomorrow for a big concert in LA and with everything spreading around I'm worried he'll catch it there. We're mainly introverts but his friend that's slightly disabled has been begging him to go for months. 

How can I overcome my fear about this? He never gets to do anything fun so I'm sure he's happy but I'm paranoid about everything."
Anxiety,I wish I was someone else.,
Anxiety,I was on a reality game show and it gives me anxiety to this day,"During Covid, there was this reality game show (like the Challenge and Big Brother) released on YouTube. I was one of the contestants, thinking it would be fun. It wasn’t fun at all.

I don’t remember how long I stayed playing for, but each round lasted an hour or so, and we would stay in a room for 8 + hours alone afterwords. Without food. Without water. Every round, a person would be voted out. A friend of mine played with me, and he ended up being the one to take me out. He used our personal friendship against me.

It was the worst experience of my life. Before I was eliminated, I had a full on mental breakdown. On camera, I just looked so weird. Like I was rambling and trying to be funny. But deep down, I was literally having a breakdown. We would have confessionals, talk about other players or so. I was done. Hungry and dehydrated, I think I was dying. I kept hearing voices throughout the day.

People online tweeted horrible things about me.

Guess what? I’m still alive. I’m learned from it all. Those people will never know what I’ve been through.

Idk felt like ranting about it."
Anxiety,Let me isolate in peace to recover!!,"I just want to be left alone and my recovery requires isolation when my anxiety gets bad (Which is pretty bad at the moment) but friends don't seem to understand this they continue to call or text and if I try to explain it I come off as a jerk. Don't try to guilt trip me over plans you're making without me, I don't care! I wouldn't go if you paid me!! I'm trying to get well enough to even function does that compute?"
Anxiety,I haven’t held a job for longer than a few weeks in 6 months,"And before then I was having extremely long gaps of unemployment or missing work a lot in general.

I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub or something but I’m lost and I just want to know if there’s anyone out there that can relate. I just want to know if I’m alone or not.

I was supposed to start a new job today but when the hour to leave approached it’s like… I had no control. Suddenly no amount of rationalizing worked. I felt dread. I always think myself out of doing things. I go through therapy rather consistently and I’m still so dysfunctional. What the hell am I supposed to do? Is it just going to continue until I feel there’s no hope left?

Can anyone relate? Can anyone help me or just listen?"
Anxiety,problems related to university,"Essentially, I can't study.

Anxiety,I'm considering cutting out dairy products from my diet. Does whey protein also need to go?,"I've heard from people how this greatly helped their anxiety. I don't think I have any digestive issues with dairy though since I've been consuming it whole my life, but I think I should give it a shot.

Now I've also started weight lifting and I take a protein shake 2x a day of which one of them is a whey protein shake (since it has the best amino acid profile). Do you think I should cut that out as well? My Whey protein is an isolate and so does not contain any casein nor lactose.

Is there anything else in dairy / milk that could cause the anxiety? 

Thanks!"

I am about to go on a cruise to Italy with my parents and I have been struggling with my anxiety for the past couple of months at a bit of a higher level than it has been for years. Anyone have tips on how to find calm when you are away from home/places that you feel safe in and in new places (especially where it is going to be super hot and I’ve never handled heat so well 😬)?
I take Zoloft and propranolol daily and have an emergency supply of lorazepam in case my anxiety is especially bad, but I really try to avoid taking it if I can.
Thanks 💕"
Anxiety,I posted pictures of my wedding reception invitations on a wedding sub…,"People were offering their unsolicited opinions about my reception and my invitations and it made me feel bad. And worried if my guests are really going to think what these people thought. Someone even sent me like 20 chat messages saying they didn’t want to embarrass me on the post, but here’s reasons a, b, and c why your reception party is going to fail. 

I just wanted to share my excitement over my beautiful invitations and I didn’t realize people would be so mean. I’m trying not to take their comments to heart."
Anxiety,Moms birthday dinner-huge trigger present(father),Today is my moms birthday dinner and a huge trigger for my anxiety-my father-will be there in attendance. I already couldn't sleep last night and I feel physically ill today. I know the ill symptoms are just me working myself up because I am so nervous. Everytime I am around him I am reminded of everything he did to damage me when I was younger and it makes me feel like I want to just die. My mom is expecting me to be there but being around him just makes me fold and ruins me for days on end. Does anyone have any tips that can help me in this situation? Am I a bad daughter?
Anxiety,Has Xanax made anyone’s anxiety worse?,"Been dealing with lots of stress lately, and recovering from a minor surgery. My anxiety peaked a couple weeks ago when PVCs (heart palpitations) started. I wasn’t sleeping well so doc prescribed Xanax XR. 

I started at a 1 mg for the first two nights, but still woke up in the middle of the night. I increased to 2 mg the next night and same thing but also woke up with horrible tremors and shaking that lasted the whole day. My doc thought it was probably a fluke so I took 2mg again last night and had an even worse night. 

Has anyone else experienced this?? I was previously on Klonopin as needed and I’m yearning for the calm therapeutic relief that provided. I feel like Xanax hasn’t done anything except give me more anxiety, shakes, and diarrhea."
Anxiety,Pls help to find the cause of my symptom.,"Hi all, i need a help from you guys. I have a problem that if I listen to some inspiring beats even at low volume(e.g., Radioactive, way down we go) or reading about anything interesting, Or getting excited about new topic, explaining a interesting topic to my friends or thinking about the tasks to do or imagining ambitious goals i feel my chest tightened, breathing becomes little difficult, sense of judgement not so clear.

I tried meditation, deep breaths, watching funny things, going for a stroll. These gives us a relief but everytime i cannot do this for e.g. if i m at work. Also if i abstain from hearing such things, stop getting excited at things, I cannot do tasks with love and somehow even as a little cheat if i hear one song, it gets so addictive and this painful loop continues. Pls suggest me any measures on what I am doing wrong. Will this lead to a heart problem later in my life. I really dont want to experience this. At the same time, i cannot give up being competitive or thrilled for doing some task.

Sorry i dont even know which is the right sub to ask this question as i am confused whether this s a anxiety problem or physical health problem.

Pls give me any useful leads.

Thanks for ur time."

Anxiety,School has ruined Sundays for me.,"It has gotten a lot better, but it's still there. Sundays used to indicate that school was the next day, which really spiked my anxiety. It would be really bad if I had a presentation or something. I'm 26 now, and this feeling shows up every now and then to fuck with me, especially if I have a dream about being in school.


It goes away after I refocus myself which I've learned to do over the years. I just hate being tortured by the past."
Anxiety,I'm going through a big change in my life and it has taken a toll on my mental health,"I'm moving out of country for grad school. I'm going to be leaving soon and I still haven't got used to the change yet. Additionally, I'm a workaholic and leaving my job has been difficult. However, the burnout has also taken a toll on me since I haven't taken a vacation in two years and I'm not giving myself enough time to get ready to move out. I'm overthinking and my anxiety has skyrocketed (I already take medication for it) . I don't know how to control my emotions. I've fallen into a vicious cycle to the point where I don't know what would give me joy. I keep bringing myself down and not having a job is going to increase my self-criticism. All of this is accompanied with a feeling of loneliness, which is why I decided to share my feelings here."

Anxiety,I’m convinced I have a brain tumor.,"I have a headache every single day 24 hours a day( went to tons of doctors and got no answers).2 years ago I was in the ER i thought i was dying. They did a head CT and at a later time i had an MRI done. They both came back normal. A little while after that I started to feel not as bad( still awful) but slightly better knowing it wasn’t anything serious. But lately i’ve been feeling really weird. Headaches seem different, sweat hands and feet, sometimes off balance, I get shaky and weak, nausea, don’t feel like myself. It honestly feels like i can’t think straight and it’s really scary. I am constantly worrying my mind never shuts off. I can never just relax. I am convinced that I have some deadly disease. My mom keeps saying it’s just anxiety and it’s like idk if it is.

Anxiety,"I asked for a demotion, now I feel like a failure","I've been with the company I work for for 15 years. I worked my way up and became a supervisor 3 years ago.  I hated it and was miserable, stressed out even when I wasn't working I was thinking and worrying about working.  

Logically I knew I was good at my job, but I had imposter syndrome and felt like I didn't  deserve the position and I worked so hard to become a supervisor that I didn't want to just give up on it. 

Lately our employee turnover has been high, I was sick of training people just to have them leave.   A month or so ago another supervisor started ""joking"" because I couldn't remember some of the new people's names.  Honestly I felt like why bother, they're going to leave anyway.  (No I didn't say that). 

Supervising was horrible for my anxiety, I couldn't even enjoy being out with friends because in the back of my mind I was thinking ""I have to do this and this and this when I get to work tomorrow"". 

Friday I asked to step down.  Well it was step down or quit, I'm going back to my old position and honestly I'm relieved.  I get to go to work, do my job and go home. I only have to worry about me and my performance and not 30 other people. 

Now I'm just like... everyone (in my personal life. I don'tcare what coworkers think) is going to think I'm a failure.   Honestly I sort of feel like one too, but this is better for me. 

My anxiety is too bad to be in management."

I don't want to get rid of a benzo addiction to then have to fight a Pregabalin addiction , Drs said it is not addictive but I read on internet that people suffer too when they have to take them off.

Than benzos been taking clonopin and have tried 8mg dose which is good but still not as much as I would like.
I also got lyrica which has done not so much so far but I know it takes time.

Anxiety,Boyfriends female friend that likes him texts him all the time… can’t stop feeling jealous,"My bf is aware that she has a crush on him but they have been friends for years and he has many times assured me that he has no feelings for her and she just comes to him for advice a lot. He says he only responds to her and does not reach out first. 

But it’s constant. Like I wake up and see he’s texting her. We’re in an uber and I look over and again he’s gotten messages from her. She’s always the first person to like his instagram posts. She has to message him directly about every story he posts. 

He says that she is annoying and he understands why I am annoyed by her, but they have a friendship history there that it’s not like I can be like stop talking to her. I don’t want one that gf who controls who my bf talks to. 

But seeing her name pop up on my bf’s on every messaging channel insta snapchat whatsapp gives me visceral anxiety. Sometimes I  can’t help but bring it up to him and ask if he’s being honest about their relationship and he always reassures me it’s really nothing. 

It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I have to look over his shoulder every time he’s texting to see if it’s her. I get urges to snoop on his phone, which I know is wrong and won’t. 

She lives in his home country so they can’t see each other in person but if they could I think I would go mad everytime they hung out. 

Has anyone dealt with this? How do I just stop caring?"

I can’t stop crying, I don’t know how I’m going to last, luckily it is only for a few weeks but I am also doing something that will take me out of my comfort zone so that has heightened my anxiety like crazy, I can’t sleep and I have no appetite. I don’t know what I’m going to do, I don’t want to leave and go home early but I feel like this is going to be really hard for me. I’m pretty sure I have separation anxiety."
Anxiety,Anxiety and working,"Does anyone else have a hard time getting or holding a job due to their anxiety? I feel so lost lately. I haven't had a real job in almost 8 years with the exception of a job I got in 2018 but only went for two days because I was so anxious I was getting sick and not able to keep up. I just feel hopeless and like I'm disappointing everyone in my life. I was recently offered a job doing something I love and I should be happy but I'm not. I'm so anxious I've been waking up to anxiety attacks again for the first time in a while. I want to take the job but my anxiety is making me think twice, I don't want to take it because what if I get too anxious and quit like always? But if I don't try I'll feel bad also. I'm just so down and lost lately."

I am not a shy or unsocial person, but when i have to speek in front of a group that i dont know, especially teachers etc, my voice gets really shake, Pulse goes to 120, i sweat a lot and my brain gets blank.   
I visited my doctor and asked her about beta-blockers because they can help with all the physical symptoms. I tried it 2 days ago and it worked kind of well, but it is still not enough.   
My doctor also prescribed me a benzodiazepine (Bromazepam 6mg) for emergencies.   


**Do you have experience with using these substances for oral exams, especially in view of coginitive abelities?**   
I know, that they can have negative impact on memory, but i read that it is primarely affecting learning new stuff. 

Thanks!"
Anxiety,how do you deal with (academic) burnout?,"So this year has been quite stressful and my mental health has been worse than ever. Right now I'm going through a burnout and I feel that anxiety and stress haunt me even now that I'm on vacation.

Anxiety,How do I get rid of the pain in my chest?,"Drs say it’s not my heart or anything serious as the symptoms would be different. So I guess it must be anxiety. But the pain is REAL. It stops me when I’m working or doing anything really. It’s interfering with my life every day. Any tips?

It’s on the left side of my chest. Like a pushing/stabbing pain. Kind of like when you pull a muscle. Please I’m struggling a lot."
Anxiety,Social anxiety AFTER an interaction?,"To preface this: I’ve always been a social person (but I also crave alone time). I’ve also always had anxiety. However, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve actually gotten worse with my social anxiety. The thing is, it doesn’t bother me until after I leave the interaction. During, I’m fine (most of the time) other than the occasional thought of “oh I shouldn’t have said that” but that’s about it. It’s usually after that’s the problem. I spend hours, sometimes days, picking apart my interaction, how it was perceived, etc. it almost feels like a bad hangover. Anyone deal with this? How can I manage? 
I ask my fiancé for reassurance often, and he tells me I never do or say anything wrong. But I know I don’t need to ask for reassurance as much as I do. I want to kick this habit myself. Advice, stories, etc are all welcomed! I’m so thankful for this Reddit thread! ❤️"

Anxiety,Morning sickness?,"Does anyone else with anxiety experience bad morning sickness? Ever since I got my new job a few months ago, I’ve been having BAD morning sickness. Every goddamn morning. I’m talking nausea and cramps so bad it literally wakes me up, sometimes I joke that I don’t need to set an alarm because they’ll always wake me up.

Usually it goes away within an hour or two, but there are times where I regrettably call in sick to work because it’s just so severe.

It really gets in the way of my life and makes it extremely difficult every morning. I know anxiety is the main cause of it, especially work anxiety, since I rarely get sick on the weekends. Still, I went to see my doctor just to rule out any other possible causes. I’m gonna get blood work done to see if I have celiac or if I’m lactose intolerant, but until then I just have to deal with it.

This is like a half rant, but I’m just wondering if anyone else deals with this too? And maybe if anyone has any advice? I want nothing more than to not feel sick every morning."

Anxiety,I'm tired of it,"I finished school 8 years ago.I changed a couple of schools.After I transferred to another school, my life got worse.My classmates didn't like me.Sometimes they bullied me.I was lonely.I considered myself the worst.My parents were unhappy with my studies, my father scolded me.

The girls didn't like me.I envied the boys that the girls liked.I wasn't attractive enough.I began to think that something was wrong with me.I tried to distract myself with video games and porn.Pornography made me feel worse.Sometimes I felt depressed, sometimes anxious.

In my soul, there was enough pain, loneliness, resentment, low opinion of myself.And after porn, it all intensified.I began to think that I have the wrong body, that I'm not beautiful enough, my dick is not right, the color of my hair, eyes, skin is not right."
Anxiety,To those of you who have legal benzo prescriptions — how did you convince a medical professional to sign off on the script?," I’ve struggled with anxiety since 2018 and it’s only getting worse. I’ve tried counseling/therapy, take CBD daily, exercise enough and eat somewhat healthy.   

My quality of life is taking a huge toll — afraid to go to social events even with family. Anxiety runs in the family and two of my siblings even got prescriptions but we don’t talk about that stuff ever otherwise I’d ask them.

I’ve taken benzos recreationally before a few years ago and they 100% help me feel normal. I know they would help.

Do I mention that to the psychologist and then ask for a prescription or would that raise red flags?  I’m worried if I directly ask and mention past use they’ll think I don’t actually need it and want to abuse it."
Anxiety,Help me please. Insomnia for 1 year. Its like dying everyday.,"Hello everybody. I am facing insomnia from the past one year. I got covid one year before. I was in hospital and at that time every few hours somebody is dying in front of me. I got so scared and anxiety hit me so hard that my mouth remains dry, my hands were shaking, my heartbeat doubles. I feels like i am going to die and this thought didn't let me sleep for 20 days straight in a row. Covid gone but now i got insomnia. I went to bed but didn't get even a single minute of sleep. I got so frustrated, the days was like hell, it was like somebody just take my soul out of body, i don't want to live anymore. Tried melatonin, Vitamin B6 Tablet, Got sunlight daily, nothing works. Then I consult to a doctor. She prescribed me to take clonazepam .25mg for 4 weeks and along to take mirtazapine 7.5mg. Then as per doctors suggestion i stopped taking clonazepam after 4 weeks and continued to take mirtazapine 7.5 mg. It was good for 8 months. I started exercise 30mins daily. Walk for 5 km daily. Now Few days before my body again started to facing insomnia( there is no stress, the insomnia comes automatically). In 10 days duration my sleep got reduced to 1 hour per day and now after 10 days i got no sleep not even a single minute. I don't know what happens to my body, i talked to my close persons tell about my problem but nobody understands me. Should i give a try to homeopathy medicine? I am sharing this to everybody on reddit, so that if anybody has any solution please guide me."
Anxiety,FMLA Leave for Mental Health??,"Has anyone ever taken medical/FMLA leave from work due to uncontrollable panic&amp;anxiety? I've always had anxiety, but never this badly or for this long and I'm not sure what else to do. I just need a break. How'd it go? Was it worth it?"
Anxiety,Anyone else have bad reactions to antidepressants when they first tried them?,"So I'm at that point with my anxiety where it's hit a new low. I was prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro/escitalopram by my doctor and was nervous about taking it but eventually I caved because my anxiety only seemed to get worse as time passed. What followed was completely awful. After about an hour I felt really short of breath, my heart was racing/pounding, I felt really weak and shaky, I felt nauseated, I kept getting cold flushes starting from my feet to my chest, I genuinely thought I might be having serotonin syndrome cause it felt that bad(there's no reason that would be the case though as I don't take any other meds that effect serotonin). My dad convinced me not to go to the hospital because he was certain it was just anxiety. I didn't get hardly any sleep(I took it at night), my heart rate stayed above 100 like the entire night(at least all the times I checked). Once I made it to morning I still felt weak and really anxious but after a while my heart rate lowered and I felt a little better. I couldn't do much, not even watch youtube videos which is usually my go to for distractions, it was just too overwhelming. I spent most of the time sitting in bed falling asleep and waking up every few minutes. The anxiety hit me again that night and the next morning and it kind of stayed that way for a few days. It took me around 4 days to finally gain my appetite back and feel more normal again(normal meaning at least able to function how I used to). Even so, ever since then I've been really easy to set off, my migraines have gotten worse, I've been having more brain fog, little to no appetite, I have more times when I feel depressed, it's been a bit rough this month :(

I truly don't understand how or why I had such a big reaction to it. It wasn't a large dose and Lexapro generally has minimal side effects for most people. I did not continue to take it for obvious reasons. It's a bit discouraging honestly. I guess why I'm saying all of this is because I'm just wondering if anyone else ran into the same problem as me? My options are a bit limited. I can try other medications or try to exercise more. Problem is I'm terrified of both. I've tried exercising in the past but I can never stick with it long enough to get to a point where it helps and I'm afraid of what my body will do if I push it past a simple walk. Taking medications makes me incredibly anxious because I really don't want to go through all that again. I was initially nervous about taking it and even then I wasn't expecting that bad of a situation.

Have any of you had something similar happen? Did you ever find out why your body reacted that way? What did you do moving forward?"
Anxiety,I get sad sometimes....," I dm alot of people from my college on IG, 70 percent of them are females and 30 percent guys, but the thing is many times I either get left on sent for weeks, either get left on sent or we just have a awkwardly forced conversation for 2 days and then I give up, but for the people that leave me on seen or sent really make me anxious I check my DMs 100 times a day just to see if they replied or not or hoping to get a reply from them.

I keep thinking about it all day and this just makes my day worse and sadder, I started out Dming people cause I have social anxiety and wanted to make some friends, but it came bitting back, I don't know what to do I always feel so under confident and low due to this.

I just want to be able to make more friends and lowkey want to develop such attitude where I don't really care about whether they reply or not I'll move on from it.

You might think why I do this online and now directly walk up to them, well my college is 300 km away from home, different people who speak different languages, different views and different persecptions, I get intimidated by this the thought of straight face to face, so I try to strike a convo online and then move forward with the face to face convo.

But I'm pretty bad at online also lmao. I just don't want to care about what people think or what happens, i just want to be happy and carefree that's all..........."

Anxiety,Cavities and dental anxiety,"My brain is really scatteted so I'm sorry if this doesnt make any sense. I'm going to the dentist tomorrow and I'm freaking out. I haven't been to the dentist in like 6 or 7 years. I am terrified of choking, since I had a bad experience last time I went when getting a filling. 

So, during covid, my hygiene got really bad. I was anxious all the time, and I stopped taking care of myself. I brushed my teeth like once every other day, never flossed, and showered like once a week. I was working from home and I didn't let my partner come over for a long time so it didn't really affect anyone but me. I've since moved in with my partner and he's helped me to take better care of myself. I'm brushing twice a day, flossing every day, and showering most days.

I'm worried that the time I spent at the beginning of covid caused some cavities. I swear I can see a hole in the back of one of my front teeth and it's freaking me out. I don't know if I'm feeling discomfort because the decay is too far gone or if I'm just hyperaware of my tooth and that feels uncomfy. 

My mother in law is a hygienist, and she and her coworker are going to be cleaning mine and my partners teeth tomorrow. She knows how scared I am, and I'm planning to take some xanax before but I'm still so freaked out. She looked at my teeth at home a few weeks ago to try to put my mind at ease, but the lighting wasn't great. She said my teeth looked really great and healthy but I keep feeling that spot that I swear is new but she didn't feel it with her tool or see it. 

I'm so scared that they're going to look at it and tell me I have to get a filling. I hate that I'm so scared of the dentist because I know now how important dental hygiene is, and I do everything I can to take care of my mouth now. But my stupid mistakes in the past may have caused huge problems. 

I don't know why I'm here. I don't want to bother my partner with this since he's already heard the story a million times. He insists that his mom is right but I'm scared that my front teeth and a few others will need to get fillings. 

Do you guys have any advice for tackling this appointment tomorrow? I need all the help I can get to survive this."

I keep worrying that in a few years everything will be really violent and that I will die. I don’t know. I feel like the world is ending and no one cares. I am trying to go about my day but with each day comes more disconcerting news. I am on Wellbutrin but I still feel anxious and think I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Anxiety,anxiety is so annoying,i honestly hate the constant worrying especially about future things and things that *could* happen even if they probably wont. i just shouldn’t even worry about these things unless they happen and i’m just tired.
Anxiety,lmao anxiety took sleep from me,"I didn't get any quality well rested sleep for almost 3 years since i developed anxiety disorder , i forgot how it feels to go to bed and wake up fully rested, I'm literally dying, my body is dying, at this point I'm giving up, I'm gonna get on antidepressants, i can't take it anymore, there's nothing I can do helps, no amount of meditation shuts my mind, it's like a part of my brain constantly keeps me in fight or flight mode, this happened after i experinced intense trauma from gaslighting. Like my brain is completely gone, i have no control over my anxiety anymore, it's self sustaining now.

For real i think antidepressants is necessary to me at this point, i don't think any of you understand how it feels to have a fast beating heart rate 24/7 , not being able to breath and feel peace for 5 seconds, not being able to join my classes at school, not being able to leave the bed, i regret for rejecting medication this long, maybe i would've been cured until i got into this state."
Anxiety,Anxiety about July 5th/cern,"If anyone could help with some reassurance, it would be so appreciated. I've been doomscrolling for about 5 hours now, and I have work at 6:30 am, currently 3:45am where I am now. I feel like the world is going to end, I've looked everywhere for some type of reassurance but it seems like everyone truly believes something bad is going to happen. thank you💗"
Anxiety,Mini Stroke or anxiety?,"Out of nowhere tingling sensation on left side of my face, but without any other symptoms. I checked my face and I was able to smile without problems, but now I’m very worried. I don’t know if I should go to the ER"
Anxiety,A favourite YouTube died and I'm having a meltdown.,"Ever since a mix of covid, family friend dying from cancer in December, etc, I've been finding cancer and illness everywhere. I feel crazy, I feel like I'm out of time and I have something hiding and undiagnosed. Just as I was finally getting a little better after getting a psychiatrist, and starting to talk about anxiety, a favourite YouTuber died from cancer, after I and a lot of fans were under the impression that he was doing better. I've been crying for 5 hours now. Anxiety is making my chest tight and once again, any and all pangs and pains in my body, I think are secret tumours. I go on tiktok, and I just find cancer tiktoks. Found a new song from my favorite band and it was dedicated to a person who died from cancer. I just know the upcoming few days, I will be weK and google things and panic from any and all new bodily sensations. I never thought I'd be the person who'd need trigger warnings, but here I am."
Anxiety,So good to know that I am not alone.,"I come from a third world country where anxiety isn't considered as a disease. Infact, I was diagnosed with GAD at age of 28 when I moved to America few years back. I lived my entire life thinking something is wrong with me and everyone else around me is fine. While I fight my demons like all of us, I am just very happy to know that I am not alone in this. Dont take me wrong, I am not happy on others misery and I really hope all us find peace and happiness in our lives. I am just happy to know that I am not the only one fighting my inner demons. I have spent my entire life thinking no one understands me and I am happy to know that its not true. I am writing this message at 1:40 AM struggling to fall sleep and calming myself by reading messages in this sub and reassuring myself that its OK. I am not alone, things will be fine. Hopefully soon...  Everyone please take care."
Anxiety,waking up in the middle of the night,"i have emetophobia, and when i wake up in the middle of the night it gets really triggered because i remember when i was a kid i would wake up in the middle of the night really sweaty and then it would happen. this night i randomly woke up at 1:30am and immediately was afraid it would happen again. i was really warm, probably because the ac had shut off, and my stomach did feel weird, probably because i didn’t eat dinner, but it still freaks me out. i try to go back to sleep but i don’t know why i woke up so i’m scared it might happen. please how can i fall back asleep!"
Anxiety,very nervous for work on saturday,"i have been working for a movie theater for a year now and i’ve been very comfortable here. except on wednesday i finally started “training” for box office, which wasn’t really training it was just orientation and giving us a tour of the box office and how to use the registers. i assumed they were going to be the same as the registers in concessions but there were SO many more buttons. it’s all so confusing. in concessions i felt the same when i first started but i learned as i went, so i was prepared to feel this way and knew it would get better. the reason i’m so anxious though is i have my first actual box shift on saturday, and it’s going to be extremely busy because of the new minions movie. i barely know the new register layout so being forced into this busy weekend makes me so nervous. it also doesn’t help that starting today we get secret shoppers that will judge our every mistake :( i’m going to make so many mistakes i just know it"
Anxiety,Gagging from anxiety?,Well this is a new one. Has anyone experienced this? My anxiety surprises me everyday with how much it affects me.
Anxiety,how do you sleep at night?,I have always had attacks over the realization that we all will no longer be alive some day. But normally there is days in a row where I can go with out panicking. The past year or so I have panicked every single night consistently. Have you found anything that can help turn your brain off and get a good night's rest. I'm tired of feeling exhausted over it.

Anxiety,Wisdom tooth health anxiety,Hello! Few days ago I went to the dentist and heard my wisdom teeth is growing sideways and need to be removed. Since then I have become really really afraid of infection and developing sepsis or something similar. I read infected wisdom tooth sympoms and what it can cause and know I have mild throat ache and I don't know if it's really hurting or am I imagining it and if it's somehow conneceted to the tooth. I don't even have any pain in the tooth itself. But the thing is I have really bad anxiety about this and my wisdom tooth removal is only in August and there is so much time left to wait and I am scared I am dying.
Anxiety,I've missed all of my classes for the past three months since the start of the semester.,"My anxiety has become even much worse since the start of the pandemic. I've managed to attend online classes at the start of the pandemic but my anxiety worsens as the pandemic goes on. We are still having online classes up until now. I've managed to enroll for the sem but don't have the courage to attend any class. I've tried for the first two months to even sit down and open my laptop to check my messages but I wasn't able to. I can't even bring myself to read something because I feel guilty that I should be doing my missing academic work. I always feel like I'm going to vomit or felt dizzy and going to faint. So I just lay down and do nothing at all. My parents are suspecting and questioned me if I still attend my classes so I just make up excuses about what I am doing at my uni at that time. I'm still feeling guilty because I think they are not fully convinced by my excuses and they just don't want to pressure me more.

Right now, we are still doing just online classes. I am able to sit in front of my laptop and read something but I still wasn't able to message my professors and attend classes. I always overthink what will my professors tell me or think of me, or what will my classmates think of me when I come back. My professors have become so much lenient since the start of the pandemic and I think I'm abusing it. I think I know what to do and think can do it now, but how do I do it? What should I tell them? How do I come back?"
Anxiety,failed my exams,i just failed my final hs exams. this means i have to waste another year in a house i dont wanna live in and go to a school i dont want to be at. wanna die. what can i do to feel better ?

Anxiety,How do you make friends after years of isolation?,"Hello. I am 23F!! I suffer from cptsd, mJor depressive disorder, and social anxiety. I'm also on the autism spectrum. and I've been isolating myself ever since lockdown happened. My grandmother died and this opened up old wounds and triggered my cPTSD, so I isolated and even as lockdown finished, I kept to myself. I have cptsd because my family hasn't given any emotional or holistic support and we're very broken, and me being the weird kid I was, how I reacted to this lack of love from family also affected how I view the world. I'm not very good in socializing, and even when I tried during high school I got bullied and left out. College was better but the damage was there and even if there were nice people around me, I was scared of opening myself up to them. I am great at masking my emotions so I can be a social butterfly but not great when life gets too tough to the point I can't hide my depression anymore. 

The isolation is really lonely though.. and I really wish to change my circumstances. How do you start? Now that I've graduated, I don't know where to find a community. And How do I also get over the fear of rejection or being bullied again? I'm worried people might get scared if I start opening up because my life is complex(?). They ask a question about my personal life and it's hard for me to answer because thr answer is always something heavy. I'm not even purposefully doing it to be sad but it's just a matter of fact uncomfortable (I think?) and I'm scared to scare people away. 

sorry for the long read"
Anxiety,Health anxiety about a real life condition,im not gonna go into the condition cause last time i made a vulnerable post someone i knew found me on here but my dr is reassuring me i am okay and thinks what i have is not dangerous but he wants to do a biopsy to confirm . since he told me about the biopsy i been having these strange pains in my body that i can definitely relate to the last time i was stressed about having a .. distressing illness . for a few days my body pain has been okay so if it was something serious it would be persistent . i do have asthma and its been really bad lately so since i been worrying about that all my “ body pain “ has went away . i know i have an amazing doctor who i can trust it’s just when my health anxiety gets to me i cannot function like an adult my age .  anyone else like this ?  Almost like a possible mind and body connection
Anxiety,I have to put on a completely different persona when I’m at my job,"Literally like real life roger from American dad. Except I’m anxious… before my shift and during it. They pay well. I really struggled to get a well paying job. I worked hard to find a well paying job. I’ve done acting in high school. I’ll internally have a panic attack waiting for someone to possibly scream at me or someone to try some shit. Otherwise I’m fine.  

I mean I’m drinking coffee now (not good for anxiety) but I’ve been trying to cut down (I can’t cut it out completely because a part of my brain enjoys it but the other uses it to overthink). I take buspirone but I’m still anxious and it’s obvious to everyone (the one thing I wish I could mask). I can mask it well in front of guests I work for but coworkers no…  also it doesn’t help that I have a hip sprain that is serious enough to need physical therapy and have to be on my feet. I almost fell over the platform my first day because my hip started to give out. I’m seeing a therapist and a doctor for my hip. Like I’m really trying to cope but I’m also really anxious."
Anxiety,Does anyone else really miss sweater weather?,"The 3 things that make me comfortable in public: hats, masks, and hoodies!!

Anxiety,Work anxiety,"Hi! So, I work in health care and my job is beyond stressful. Basically, I'm on a time crunch every day, I work through my lunch, I have a 45+ commute, and I go into overtime pretty much every week. I'm also constantly getting yelled at and disrespected  by my patients over things that I have no control over. I've been here for 9 months and within the past 4 months, I've developed an eye twitch that has actually been pretty scary. It started on my right eye lid and eventually transitioned to my right eyebrow and now to my left lower eye lid. I was actually thinking something was wrong with me like neurologically but then yesterday, I was in a really stressful situation and my eye was twitching the whole time and it continued throughout the rest of the day and it dawned on my that is has to be stress. I really don't know what to do and I feel like I'm destroying my body over this job. I can't really quit or get another job because my degree is very specific and there's no any other places hiring. I don't want to sound like a baby or that I'm complaining that I have a good job, I just know working should not be *this* stressful."

Anxiety,"How to go about getting CBT, and where to start really fixing this all ?","aaaaaaaaa this is all personal and embarrassing coming from someone who never shares/posts anything on the internet but I need help so here we go

I’ve got most social anxiety and a bit of other anxieties. The social anxiety has really struck/stuck with me since the 7th grade, I realized  I had some type of social anxiety by the 8th grade, yet it’s only gotten progressively worse. I’m in the 11th grade now and I haven’t eaten lunch with a friend group of my own since the 7th grade, I mostly haven eaten in bathrooms or the teacher parking lot to avoid people seeing me alone. I cannot talk to kids my age. Simple questions are fine but I can’t really do light conversation. I notice myself distancing from all possibilities of conversation with dead-end responses and avoiding social situations. I just don’t talk to people, I isolate myself and avoid them . Honestly, it’s just your typical case of social anxiety. It’s been getting worse I’ve noticed, this little bubble I’ve created around myself has worsened my anxiety. I first noticed this when I had my dad drop me off at a mall to get a job application. When I first walked through the doors, the mass amount of people made me freeze in my steps for a bit. It was like a wave of anxiety just hit me dead in my tracks. I was nervous the whole time walking around. Big crowds are no different, rally’s at my school do the same thing to me. I freeze and panic. I hate it. This whole freezing thing is unique to this year, it’s never happened this consistently/bad before.
Other anxieties have also been bothering which worries me even more. Throughout the school year I had plenty of anxiety-filled nights where I found it difficult to fall asleep because I was just worried about upcoming tests. I never felt like I was doing enough work and sometimes I would get up out of my bed to work on an essay or whatnot. Normal right?
Well now it’s three weeks into the summer and somehow the restless feeling that I’m not doing enough or that something bad is going to happen because I’m not doing enough has been keeping me from sleeping consistently now, even on days where I’m generally happy. I’m thinking about the AP classes I’m taking next school year and how I’m not studying for them, about my summer homework I haven’t completed, etc. I still have plenty of time for that all, why can’t I sleep? I get this sinking feeling in my heart that something is wrong and it’s terrible. That’s why I’m writing this post, I have a big day tomorrow yet it’s 4am and I cant sleep. 

That being said, this idea has been floating around in my head for awhile now. I’m not getting better, I want to get real help before this gets any worse. 
How do I go about getting therapy in a quiet manner? I’m only 16, and I’d feel stupid for telling my parents about any of this but I want help at this point. 

Honestly, I’ve never really talked in detail about this to anyone so any advice would be really great.
Best wishes to you, and any anxieties you might be facing :)

Ps. Sorry if this was long, I’m not used to using Reddit"
Anxiety,Worrying about your sister or brother getting old,Do you also worry when your brother gets older. I get anxious every time I remember all the memories of when he was just about 6 years old or younger and we were just playing. I'm afraid he's getting old and we won't be able to do what we used to do. Fyi he's 9 now
Anxiety,What’s wrong with me??,"I’ve hit a wall. Legit don’t know what to do. I even started therapy and I come out of therapy with more questions than before. I think I have either adhd or depression. I told that to my therapist and she just said “those are labels psychiatrists give to people. So here we are trying to work on the things that cause those feelings”. Sure yeah we work on those things but I don’t see any result here. I struggle so much to find motivation to do anything. Most things I do is because I’ve just learnt to do them like cleaning the house,drawing,taking a bath. I’m not saying I don’t enjoy doing stuff anymore whatsoever but I feel like I’m completely lost. Therapist says I have a problem identifying my emotions so we are working on it. I’ve read that it helps setting goals. How the hell do I do that? I’ve no idea what that means. Even if I find something I will be excited the first minutes of trying to achieve this goal rebut then it becomes pointless. That’s legit my whole life, getting excited for something and then meh. Do I need medication?"

Anxiety,At my wits end,"Hi,

I'm about 3 months into severe anxiety and some depression. Lots of bad things happened at work and last week I got fired. Financial situation is dire and I'm freaking out. Sleep is a major issue and I constantly worry about the future. I'm very scared. I've been to therapy on meds and nothing works. The chatter in my mind is constant and negative. Please help!"
Anxiety,I can't play Fortnite without feeling worthless and hating myself,"I'm such worthless trash at this game. I drop down, land, die, get danced on and humiliated, rage, punch myself and contemplate suicide, and then rinse and repeat over and over again. This game has been driving me insane and I just hate myself for being such trash. No other game has made me feel so worthless like this. Every single time I die I just rage so hard... I can't help but impulsively and violently start punching myself. I just hate the thought of some streamer killing me with tons of ppl watching and he's all like ""man this kid is trash!!"" and everyone in the chat is all ""LOL you shit on that guy he sucks!!!"" and every single time I die I think about how they recorded that kill and I hate myself and think about what I could have done differently to not die..... It's as the saying goes: it sucks to suck.... and that's me right there. Not only do I suck at the game... but then I get shit on and danced on and humiliated and I hate myself so fucking much and I feel like such a worthless piece of fucking garbage that's worthless to society I'm just a loser getting his ass kicked all day in Fortnite I just suck and I hate myself so much for it...

And I know I'm gonna get comments of someone saying ""dude it's just a game -\_-"" .......oh yeah? Well if it's just a game... then why does everyone feel the need to dance on me and humiliate me literally every single time they kill me to make me feel bad about myself? Why do I get labeled as ""trash"" for not being good it seems people take it pretty seriously for a ""game"". Why do streamers like Tfue and stuff call everyone they kill trash and make fun of them for getting killed? If it's just a game why is it so humiliating for someone to die and you get to dance and shit on them and call them trash?

Does anyone know a way I can just get bot lobbies from now on? I bought this battle pass (first one I bought for this game) and I can hardly bring myself to finish these quests... trying to go for quests while ppl are just trying to kill you is also such annoying trash... I just want bot lobbies so I can do these quests and then not have to play the br mode anymore.

It's like I'm addicted to this game... I can't stop playing cause when I get my ass kicked and get danced on if I turn the game off and try to go do something else I'll just be all alone thinking to myself what a worthless piece of trash loser I am for getting my ass kicked like that I'm just a weak little loser who gets his ass kicked... so I keep playing in hopes of actually getting a kill and trying to redeem myself so I don't hate myself and wanna puke every single time I look in the mirror. I can never manage to get more than 5 kills in a match... every time I land near people I die immediately within 2 seconds, and then every time I land far from everyone I spend 10 minutes getting all the best loot I can just to die in 2 seconds again when I run into someone.... I'm just worthless fucking trash and there's literally no reason for me to play this game... but I bought this battle pass and wanna at least get all the stuff in it so I at least get my money's worth or whatever... I have bruises all over my leg from freaking out over this game... I get so angry my head hurts so bad whenever I play this and I just want to end myself so badly for being such worthless trash at this game"
Anxiety,Fasted workouts,"This sounds like a silly question as I type it, but has anyone found fasted morning workouts to be a cause of anxiety? Will I ever be able to do them again?

Backstory: I had low levels of anxiety for a while and things certainly built up over time, but anxiety slammed me one day after a few weeks of build up. At the same time I had been exercising every morning, fasted + pre-workout with 100mg caffeine, 5-6 days a week for about 6 months. I stopped those fasted workout and quit caffeine ever since (plus got on Lexapro). Now that I’m stable, I would love to be able to do those early fasted workouts (no caffeine) again because I have kids and makes life easier, but I’m terrified that it will lead to anxiety again (messing with the cortisol spikes). 

Thoughts? Experience?"

Anxiety,Are we being over the top and tips on overcoming anxiety on being independent from my parents?,"Hi everyone, so my girlfriend (19F) and I (20M) have been dating for a year and a half now. We are long distance, and we were fortunate enough to be able to meet each other face to face back in March when my girlfriend flew down to here. Before this time, my parents expressed support and they seemed to care about my girlfriend before she came down and they were happy for us. It was different for them because they didn’t know my girlfriend nearly as well as I do obviously so it’s important for them to get to know her while she’s here. They offered to let her stay at our house but I was getting bad feelings. Fast forward to her making it down here and it really took a turn for the worst. She was here for two weeks, and the first thing me and her naturally wanted to do was spend time between just me and her. She arrived later in the day, so we got home on a Saturday night, spent that night together in my room, and most of Sunday together. We wanted to eat dinner with them on Sunday night while we all were getting our food from different takeout spots and they went and ate without us and didn’t bother trying to get to know her while we sat in the kitchen waiting for them to stop watching a show and talk to us. They never did end up coming out and getting to know her. So we spent Saturday night and Sunday together, and Monday morning while my girlfriend is still hanging out up in my room I go downstairs to talk to my mom and see how she’s doing and one of the initial things she says to me is how my dad feels “disrespected because we have been in the room the whole day” which it hadn’t even been long? We just wanted to see each other. 

Our trip of two weeks was filled with moments like that of different reasons. They called her disrespectful because she was starving at one point and started eating her burger while we were all ordering takeout half way through the week and they proceeded to ask super disrespectful questions about our relationship and it all just put a bad taste in our mouth. It ruined our trip for us because it felt like we were walking on egg shells constantly and like we were being watched the whole time. They made no effort to truly get to know her except for one night when my mom and my girlfriend discussed with each other their life stories. My mom gave a half assed apology to my girlfriend for the burger scenario during this time too while my dad actually apologized during the night everything happened.

Some time after the trip I made it a point to discuss with them how we felt about everything. I pointed out that it was supposed to be our vacation time and of course we wanted to spend time together. I was discussing how we felt and my mom just starts doubling down on everything she said and said awful things about her. Her parents were always terrible during her life and my mom has the audacity to say that maybe her parents had a reason to act like that. This whole conversation I had with her also surrounded the fact that she would be “kissing our ass” since we wanted a better apology and it just blows my mind. She said so many hurtful things about her and then at the end accused me of waiting for them to die so I “could take the house for myself” after I showed surprise a couple weeks before to them talking about moving.

During the next few weeks all the way up to now they’ve periodically said passive aggressive things about her (even my dad saying she’s not compassionate and his only example was the burger scenario like??) while trying to go back to like how it was before where they act like they like her. We just got out first apartment and she’s got a flight to come to me in a couple months to move here and we are wanting to do no contact. We don’t want every great moment we have soured by my parents for some stupid reason each time. 

I don’t know if I was emotionally abused but my girlfriend mentions I could be. I feel guilt for everything we want to do and I constantly feel like I should be trying to please them too. I feel a ton of anxiety when I think about setting boundaries and I recognize this isn’t normal. They’ve raised me pretty decently my whole life but everything took a massive turn when I brought my girlfriend into my life and so we are thinking it could be jealousy maybe? I just want to live a happy life with my girlfriend and I don’t want the moment of us getting our first apartment to be tainted at all.

I’m powering through my anxiety the best I can and I would like tips on how to do so. I just told them yesterday since we got the keys for our apartment that I only wanna keep them between me and her and they took well to that surprisingly. I want this to be a good experience for my girlfriend, she’s moving all the way here for me and I don’t want her to feel unsafe or uncomfortable at all. Everything I wrote is just a quick summary of what happened without really going into every little passive aggressive thing they said or did during that time. We just wanna know if we are being dramatic or not and we are looking for tips on what we should do?"
Anxiety,I need to get this off my chest.,"
I went out with this group of people for the first time and we were playing truth or dare. They asked what’s the worst thing that happened to you this year. I got sexually assaulted. And it hit me so hard. I had to drop out of college, saw a psychologist, a psychiatrist and a social worker at the same time to be able to hold myself together. I couldn’t tell them all of that obviously, it’s my first time meeting them after all. With tears in my eyes i told them to change the question cause i was triggered. I went to the restroom and cried. They understood everything (4 dudes and my friend, a girl). They kept apologizing for triggering. They were empathetic. But i feel bad. No i feel like shit. I didn’t want them to know. I ruined the mood. Why tf did this happen ? How am i supposed to act around them now ? 
Now i cant sleep because of anxiety."

Anxiety,felt like someone touched my scalp while i was about to fall asleep,"i was overthinking about something. my left leg has been feeling like a jelly since earlier because of my anxiety. and just now, as i was about to fall asleep, i became a bit more aware of my sensations in my body. then suddenly i felt a weird sensation in my scalp like i thought somebody placed their hand on my scalp and felt like they pressed their hand against it. but then my bed is near the window and the window's closed. so obviously nobody else is around except for my grandma who has been sleeping since earlier.

that was weird. i immediately get up because i thought something dangerous is happening to my health because of that scalp sensation. DAE experience this?"
Anxiety,Advice on handling work conflicts?,"Hey y’all, I was wondering if I could get your take on getting critiqued in the workplace, and honestly life in general.

To provide some background, I have been clinically diagnosed with ADHD - Combined type since I was a kid (23M). I usually reflect upon criticism and grow from it pretty well imo, but at the same time, I am very hard headed and have difficulty listening to critiques that seem to contradict my own beliefs. 

A few days ago, my boss called me into his office and scolded me for something that I had missed, which I apologized for. However, he started to indirectly, then directly suggest that I was disrespecting him and our patients. This caused me to lose my temper and fight back because truthfully, I hate working in healthcare, but one thing I will never do is disrespect a patient. Obviously the argument was a little more complicated, but that’s the TLDR version. My goal as a future healthcare provider is to help patients who feel like they have been let down by poor practice etiquette, even if it means working under individuals who possess God-Complexes. I need to start learning strategies to cope with it better, so I’d appreciate any tips."
Anxiety,throat is being weird,"Hello. It's been a few days since my throat feels weird. Sometimes it feels irritated, sometimes it hurts a bit, and other times it just feels like I have a lump. I'm not coughing or vomiting, but I'm worried about throat cancer or something of the like. 
Of course could be allergies, or bad mouth hygiene, or some virus. But I'm terrified about cancer"

Anxiety,Almost lost consciousness on a train - health anxiety and hyperthyroidism. Grateful for members of the public,"Hi all,

Guess I’m just getting things off my chest here and being grateful to those who helped.

This past week has been pretty rough. Diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, health anxiety and have a lot of expectations at a job I love.

Anyway last night I got on a train. 10 minutes in to a 2 hour journey I started getting sudden chest pain that went in parallel with my heart beats and taking deeper breaths didn’t help, on some occasions even hurt. I started to feel really faint and couldn’t tell whether this was a panic attack kicking in or my hyperthyroidism. 10 minutes later and my state didn’t improve, even with deep breathing.

I noticed the woman in front of me woke up and I thought I have to tell her in case this is serious and linked to a thyroid storm.

I asked if I could speak to her in private and walked outside the carriage. Told her I have a health condition that affects my heart, that I forgot my medication and I’m getting chest pains and my heart rate is sitting between 120-150. Asked her if I could give her my name and details in case anything happens and she was really kind about it

Fast forward a few minutes and medics told me it’s best I get off the train for the nearest A&amp;E. Doctors cancelled out a serious threat to life but told me it’s important to continue check ups with GP and control my hyperthyroidism. 

Big day, a lot of stress at work, long commute, not enough food and a huge episode on the train that didn’t help my health anxiety, but massively grateful for members of the public who helped throughout"
Anxiety,What do we think about significant other saying you are not perfect?,"I know i’m not perfect, but shouldn’t our significant others say we are? Id always want to tell mine “you’re perfect” or “you’re perfect to me”, even if no one is perfect."
Anxiety,It's been so bad recently and I can't get in to see anyone.,"###TW: Health/diseases, health anxiety

----

I was doing okay most of 2021, but once 2022 started my anxiety skyrocketed. Every single day for months I felt like I have been on high alert. I've been on the brink of a panic attack at least once a week since New Years. My health anxiety got worse ten-fold in February which in turn made my general anxiety worse as well. I have a friend who was diagnoed with (TW: lymphatic illness) &gt;!follicular lymphoma!&lt; in January (he's doing okay now thankfully) which started my spiral down into convincing myself I had it since I could &gt;!feel my lymph nodes in my neck and groin!&lt;. I finally went to the doctor's yesterday and got tests done and thank god everything was okay. I'm just really skinny so it's easier to feel them. However, I have another appointment with my cardiologist in a few days for something I was born with and I haven't been able to calm down about that. It's one thing after the other on top of everything else unrelated to health. 

I mentioned to my doctor that my anxiety has been so much worse recently and I need help, whether it be therapy or medication, anything. I tried getting in to see a therapist last month, but everyone I emailed and every practice I went to that takes my insurance (which isn't very many people to start with, yay Medicaid!) either is not accepting new patients or has a 3+ month waitlist. I'm moving out of state in 2 months now for college so it doesn't make any sense to join a waitlist for where I'm from. Not to mention the school doesn't offer health insurance so I'm going to have to apply for state insurance and pray I don't get declined. I just emailed a few psychiatrists yesterday as a last resort but I don't have high hopes.

I've been googling coping mechanisms and trying to implement self care stuff but nothing is working. The coping mechanisms help but only for 10 minutes or so then I'm back to where I started. I've been smoking weed which helps sometimes but I've been trying not to since I don't want to become dependent on that. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel so lost and helpless. I'm fucking exhausted."
Anxiety,job interview anxiety,"I just had an interview for a job I really want. I'm waiting for them to call me back, but I can't stop obsessing over how I answered the questions and what I could've said differently to give off a better impression.

Anxiety,Can't stop the paralyzing fear/anxiety every time exam season comes.,"My school usually announces exams a month before it. Plenty of time to revise right? But i just can't. I can't do it. I can't revise. I feel like I'm going to fail. I'm so afraid and anxious every day. 

Every day, i think ""oh, exams are coming, i should do something"" but I just can't start studying. I feel very scared and paranoid that I'm going to fail. I cope with anxiety by napping but after I napped, the anxiety of failing my exams comes back again. I'm so stressed and tired all the time because of my anxiety. How can i stop this fear/anxiety of exams??"

Anxiety,"Recently discovered I have a form of mild, but constant, anxiety","Hey guys 

I recently came across this thread because I'm having anxiety about my.job and the more I read into anxiety the more I realise I'm actually in a constant anxious state.

I'm 28 and had many jobs. Every job I've had I've quit because I go into a headspin if I have a bad day or a bad week. Its made worse by the fact I'm in an industry where there is a talent shortage so I'm always having recruiters offering me new things! 

As I mentioned I think I'm in a constant state of mild panic. When I had a relationship last year I constantly sought reassurance from my partner and now I'm single again I'm now really worried I won't ever find love again which makes me nervous as hell on dates. The cycle continues.

The weird thing is I've never had a panic attack but I'm always a bit nervous about something. Is there any advice people could give. I'm trying heavy breathing which helps, just wondering if there's anything else? All help appreciated"
Anxiety,Low Heart Rate.,"I have been having high heart rate in the past week or so and now all of a sudden my resting heart rate is 54 to 52, this sudden things scares me as I have health anxiety that recently gotten diagnosed. I am no athletic person I am fat overweight,i did go to the gym, but I just started here is no way that can be considered an athlete(went 3 times now). Is this some sign my anxiety is getting better or I have some underlying heart problems? I don't want to ask for diagnosis, but want to see if people had something similar happen to them. I use my sport watch to take my heart rate and I know it is not the most correct thing in the world, but it gave me correct results most of the time. I don't know if I should go to emergency, or not."
Anxiety,Exposure therapy has to be one of the hardest things im going through,"Hey everyone,

So i am a 33 year old male that has been dealing OCD/Anxiety mostly focused around my health. Last November I went for yearly bloodwork and everything was normal except my ALT was 49 and it should be between 9-46.Well i basically had a nervous breakdown and gave up having a drink or 2 a week and have been obsessing over 6 months that i have something wrong with me. I finally decided to go to a therapist and after a long and hard discussion decided to get re tested this upcoming Tuesday. Probably one of the most nerve racking things i have done and now so many things are going through my head mostly negative on what the outcome will be."
Anxiety,Has anyone taken Zoloft for anxiety?,Just wanting to see if Zoloft was helpful for anyone else.
Anxiety,Anxiety About Tipping,"Ok, so, I live in the northeast of America (New York) and I saved up enough money to get a tattoo and comfortably pay the hourly shop feel of $170 an hour.

When the tattoo was over 3 hours later I was really hungry, tired and just generally warn out. I paid for the whole $510 in cash and was so excited about my tattoo that I almost forgot to tip the artist. I meant to tip him $80, but when I came home I realized I only tipped him $40, in my rush to pay and leave. 

I have been agonizing over my crappy tip since the moment I got back home. The shop is over an hour away from me so I can't just go back and give him the rest of the tip but I don't want him to think I'm an asshole. I realize that you're supposed to tip really well for things like tattoos, but at the same time: I paid the hourly fee, was on time, sat still for the entire thing and only took a break when my artist needed one.

My anxiety tells me that I am a shitty person for not tipping more while the rational part of me says that I'm literally making something out of nothing. Tipping has always given me anxiety, even with small things like restaurants or bars. I worry about not tipping enough and then, often times, I worry about tipping too much.

What would you do in this situation?"
Anxiety,Struggling with separation anxiety as a result of the pandemic,"The pandemic had left me and my significant other “working remotely” alone together for the past 2 years. 

They started going back to in person, and now I’m struggling. I grew so accustomed to working remotely with them and feel a deep sense of loneliness when they go back to work. Even though we didn’t communicate at all when we both worked remotely together, it still felt nice to know they were just a room away throughout the work day.

It’s been an adjustment and I’m hoping this feeling doesn’t last forever. I will try to change my environment and work from the office from time to time, but that isn’t my preference since I enjoy the flexibility of being remote. Yet I absolutely couldn’t do this alone, without seeing another person all day. 

Curious if anyone has any advice. I currently take an SSRI (for previous anxiety unrelated to this I dealt with) and it doesn’t seem to be helping get rid of this feeling. I guess it’s something I’ll just need to get used to and adjust to."
Anxiety,Saroxat and studying,"Hi, I got prescribed Saroxat. I have some important exams right now. Would someone who used it please share their experience :)?"
Anxiety,I am such a disappointment,"I let my grandparents down today. I feel as though I betrayed them because I cancelled plans on them today. We had made special plans to have fun on Canada day but last minute I called them and cancelled out because I’m not feeling well. It feels like a lack of integrity from me and not being responsible/ loyal to the plans. I love them and I feel so bad for this, it’s like I am unable to live and enjoy life. Instead I make things hard for myself and others and I’m afraid they will think this is a common thing for me. I could tell they were looking forward to this all week, and I was being the asshole. They have every reason to think what I did was rude and to be angry at me."
Anxiety,I haven’t been able to watch anything because of anxiety,"One of my favorite past times is to watch tv shows, however, after an attack a while ago, it has been really hard for me to start new shows or even watch old shows because I can’t handle the thought of it ending. I have been on summer break for 2-3 weeks now and all I have been doing is scrolling through Reddit, Facebook, watching short clips on YouTube, and playing video games. I have a list of shows I want to watch and rewatch but I get anxious everytime I try to attempt to watching something because all I can think about is the show ending and how I’ll react to the ending. How am I suppose to enjoy myself from now one?
To add on, I have had really bad anxiety in the morning and early afternoon every.single.day ever since summer break started. My mind focuses on a “problem” and ruminate, overthink, etc said problem. Gosh I feel like i’m going to throw up :c"
Anxiety,It’s giving me anxiety that I can never tell if it’s anxiety or a heart attack,"
Again, I’ve posted many times about feeling like I’m having a heart attack. 
These are my symptoms:
I have this constant burning sensation in my upper back mostly in the right which then makes my arms feel kinda numb. My ears started getting hot and I know some of these are anxiety symptoms but others sound like heart attack symptoms. It’s mostly just this upper back warm burning sensation and then i did like 15 jumping jacks without any pain to my heart. I don’t have any sudden fatigue just the usual feeling like you can’t breathe feeling when you have anxiety.. idk this started happening last night and I was incredibly certain it was a heart attack because in women they say your back hurts and whatever, however that was really the only symptom I was showing along with some arm numbness. So I went to sleep and I was fine when I woke up this morning I didn’t feel anything then like idk I started feeling those symptoms again because I think I thought about them again.. I don’t know if it’s a muscle strain or whatever but anxiety usually doesn’t cause your upper back to have a burning sensation especially not after I’ve slept it off.. I did take my bpm this morning and it was really high because again I was having a bit of anxiety idk how long this is gonna last I feel like I’ve had these symptoms before when I’ve been anxious but because I recently learned that women have different heart attack symptoms and can even have them for days before actually having the heart attack I’m freaking out now."

Anxiety,Advice on Beta Blockers for Anxiety - Help!,"My docs have prescribed me propranolol 10mg tablets 3x a day. I’ve spoken to several different GP/ Pharmacists and received differing advice. 

Over the past few weeks I’ve started getting thousands of pvc’s with minimal explanation so far other than “stress”. Despite then happening at certain times of day and with exercise.

Two doctors said to take propranolol as and when I need it if symptoms get bad (and currently they get bad every late afternoon/evening) so I take 10mg propranolol. This takes two hours to work, makes me feel lethargic and drops my heart rate down to 60, perilously close to bradycardia.

Two other docs don’t care about this and say I should double my dosage to morning and evening. Every day this week my symptoms are eased from early evening until mid-afternoon the following day. I’m understandably concerned increasing the dosage will cause bradycardia not to mention further lethargy.

Other docs said to not take more than propranolol than needed as they were worried about dropping my blood pressure. They also said propranolol wasn’t necessary and the thousands of skipped beats will resolve themselves in time!? No explanation given so I assume just hoping?

I don’t understand the mechanism by which I’m supposed to take these pills for a month, come off them, and somehow my underlying symptoms will be magically resolved? Feels like I’m on a road to getting on beta blockers permanently. I don’t like it and struggling to have faith in the docs. Just feel like if the symptoms are untreatable, and the treatment is just as anxiety-provoking as the symptoms then the future is looking pretty hopeless. :("
Anxiety,Advice please,"I have to move out this weekend and my week has been waiting on the response of others and my anxiety is the worse it’s been in my life.

Anxiety,Strange Panic Attacks?,"//tw for hitting/scratching from anxiety// 

So for years now I have had really awful and intense panic/anxiety attacks (usually triggered by thoughts of death/things I have absolutely no control over). These thoughts come absolutely out of nowhere and don’t really have much correlation with my day to day life. These are incredibly short bursts of a fight or flight type anxiety responses where I get almost tunnel vision and feel trapped in my own body. They’re really distressing but aren’t long lasting. I’ve tried medications like CBD &amp; anti-anxiety medication but they’re really unpredictable with timing. My issue is that I can’t seem to identify what is happening because they’re so short (like 30 seconds). One recent development has also been that while I’m panicking I might hit or scratch at myself but I have no intentions of ever hurting myself outside of these moments. It feels like my body goes completely rogue and tries to fight itself. It just seems so out of character and I would say the fear is more intense than a typical “normal” anxiety attack. Just wondering if anyone else with anxiety might be familiar with this feeling, I’ve tried searching for answers but haven’t had much luck since most panic/anxiety attacks are described as longer episodes and are more related to present stressors. Sending love to anyone struggling with this!"
Anxiety,dating causing anxiety to flare up (27M),"Hey friends :)

Hope you're all doing great!

I have been talking to a girl for around 2 months from Tinder.. 

So far, I have enjoyed getting to know her (mostly through text), but I am now at a point where I'm overthinking things. After a bit of a chat with a friend of mine, he pointed out I kind of rejected her attempt to invite me to her place. And instead I suggested somewhere public..

Please don't be too harsh on me, I've not got a bunch of dating experience. But..I'm not sure why I did that looking back on it. Maybe just if the vibe wasn't right I didn't want to feel trapped, or have her feel like she had to get rid of me. 

But everything actually went quite well - to my surprise. It's been 2 weeks and she has asked to see me tomorrow (We both work full time and she has children) 

Now I'm kind of getting anxiety due to not really knowing what she's expecting. It's been 3 years since I got laid. And a few not so compatible dates. So safe to say my confidence in myself and OLD is quite low atm.

To add I think her ex was abusive so I'm also anxious about setting off any of her potential triggers.. like.. to the point where maybe I'm coming off as not interested

Would you find it weird if you wanted to sleep with a guy and he wanted to get to know you better first?

I'm a bit tipsy and it's 4am for me so I'm sorry for the rambling."
Anxiety,How is it to start SSRI for anxiety?,"Hi, I want to get medicine for my anxiety but I’m pretty worried about the side effects of SSRI the first weeks. 

So I wanted to ask how long the side effects lasted for you and how bad the side effects were (like is it possible to go to school while you have the side effects)."
Anxiety,Anxiety sucks:/,"I have really bad anxiety. Mostly about other people judging me. I’ve tried to let it go but it’s almost impossible for me. Meds don’t help. Doing the things I love helps a lot but the anxiety is still always in the back of my mind. I try to cope with distraction but doesn’t seem to work for very long. I suffer with panic attacks and self image issues. I’m too broke for therapy to even try it as I am only 20 years old. So I just sit in fear of my mental health almost everyday. Even at work, it’s always in my mind. I know I HAVE to not worry about what others think, and trust me I’ve tried. Just so many things give me stress and anxiety about my life that it’s hard to explain in one sitting. So I’m reaching out to other people for the first time in my life to see if any of you guys have any tips to deal with this. Thank you so much."
Anxiety,i don't get panic attacks when I'm in public anymore even when i get 0 sleep,"I still have extreme anxiety in daily basis but i got so used to having panic attacks that i learned from it, i even fainted once in school from anxiety, now i don't get this issue at all , like I'm so depresses from having anxiety that i couldn't care less what other people think of me or what i think of them anymore , i got exposed to public so many times in my worst state that i kinda lost that feeling of insecurity, so i just don't care, i just stay depressed instead lol"
Anxiety,Weird Deja Vu Feeling,"Yesterday I had a weird episode with deja vu. 

I kept having thoughts, and they came with a deja vu feeling. Like, these thoughts feel familiar but I don't remember having them. I also felt 'out of it', but I could tell you the date, the year, the president, etc. It was like a panic/deja vu attack that wouldn't go away until I slept. I still feel panicky the day after, scared it's going to happen again, or that it means something is wrong with me. My biggest fears are stroke, brain tumor, seizures, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My neurologist said it sounds like anxiety and that I should talk to my therapist about this."
Anxiety,Spotlight effect: reduce anxiety and self-judgement by becoming aware of this cognitive bias,"The spotlight effect describes how people tend to believe that others are paying more attention to them than they actually are. In other words, we tend to think there is a spotlight on us at all times, highlighting all of our mistakes or flaws or even our accomplishments and successes, for all the world to see.

The spotlight effect causes us to have an exaggerated view of our own significance to the people around us, leading us to misjudge situations and make decisions based on our overly inflated feelings of visibility.

Imagine you're at a dinner party at your friend's house. While having a great conversation with some other guests, you accidentally spill some red wine over your shirt. Embarrassed, you quickly hurry to the bathroom to clean up the mess, it feels like everyone is looking. However, a week later, when you bring up the incident in another conversation with your friends, they don't seem to even remember it happened.

The belief that others are always paying close attention to us can be harmful to our mental health, and it can hold us back by making us feel self-conscious. Everyone is very focused on themselves, their actions, and their appearance and believes that everyone else is just as aware.

Being aware of the spotlight effect can help to reduce nervousness or embarrassment in social situations. 

The spotlight effect is just one example of a type of cognitive distortions known as egocentric biases. This type of cognitive bias skews the way we see things by causing us to rely too heavily on our own perspectives. And we all do it, even if we’re not trying to.

We notice our own behaviors and appearance immediately and this is the first information we get.Then we base our assumptions about what other people might think about it around our own perception, because in our mind that is the probably most reliable information we could produce to make predictions.

So how do we deal with it?

The quickest way is to ask yourself how you'd react if it happened to someone around you.If you made a mistake and now have intrusive thoughts about how everyone thinks about you now, imagine that this happened to a person around you. How would you think of them? This is a simple way to calm down and comfort yourself when you’re caught up in anxiety due to the spotlight effect. Once you can see that people really are all caught up in their own situations, it will become easier to imagine that the spotlight is not shining on you and highlighting your flaws.

Anxiety,Chest pain/minor pressure,"I have always struggled with anxiety physical symptoms though I don’t feel particularly anxious. I have experienced shortness of breath for 3 years(went to doctor, told me nothing was wrong) which I got better at managing as time went on, though of course that this new symptom is here it’s not happening anymore. I’m having either sharp/burning chest pain or slight pressure on the left side on and off everyday.

I already work out 2-4 times a week and I don’t notice the pain being triggered during my workout. I’m in my 20s. Anyone else experienced similar or can provide words of advice/comfort? I’m not sure whether to rule it as anxiety or actually go see a doctor again."

Anxiety,Taxes,"Taxes are something that has always given me sooo much anxiety, it is one of the things that makes me fear living into adulthood. Like when do I need to start? How do I fill them? What happens if I miss them? Do I go to prison?? Currently I am an unemployed 20 year old in college in the US and I have never filled taxes, should I have started already. People tell me not to worry about but I don’t know how to NOT worry about it. From the way people talk about it it seems like if I mess it up it is a very big deal"
Anxiety,I anger came from my anxiety the entire time,"I never really thought my anxiety in itself was causing my issues. I have ASD, adhd, ocd so I contributed it to having those. Instead of anti anxiety medication I was trying mostly stimulants that makes everything worse. I tried some in the past but they were SSRIs and for me was only side effects. The one I’m on now is buspar.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s interesting because it’s basically the only medication in the anxiety class besides ones like benzos and my doc can’t prescribe those. SSRIs are more for depression than anxiety and none ever worked for me. The other medication I’m still on now is Wellbutrin and it’s still good mostly for the depression, but also lowered my anxiety a little.

&amp;#x200B;

But what I noticed is I had more outbursts since being on Wellbutrin by itself even though in general I feel a lot better. Like it lowered the type of anxiety that would avoid confrontations but left the social anxiety. Basically I felt better but felt like I had less self control. Adding the buspar I feel like my anxiety is reduced by at least 70% and it hasn’t even been a week yet. No way this is placebo though. Nothing the entire work day bothered me today."

Anxiety,dreams about nothing working anymore,"I keep having these stress dreams about going mentally insane and nothing being able to help… feeling like it’s pretty symbolic in real life because I’ve tried almost every antidepressant and nothing works. over the years it feels like I’m actually losing my mind more and more: keep forgetting really simple things, lots of physical symptoms, no motivation for the future at all and at this point not sure if I’ll ever get it back. let me make it clear that I have absolutely NO intentions of killing myself, just this persistent nagging feeling of “is this ever gonna end?” How do you cope with these feelings? I’m in therapy and journal, have a solid friend group, but it only does so much."
Anxiety,People texting me multiple times in a row/ gives me severe anxiety,"I have a few people who will just bombard me with messages or texts. They will send 5, 6, 7 plus messages straight in a row. It gives me severe anxiety and stresses me out. I have told these people that I get anxiety when they do this, yet they keep doing it. One is my brother, another is a friend of mine. How do you get these people to stop and understand?

Anxiety,1st day on duloxetine - fainted,"So, I had my first horrible panic attack 2.5 years ago and since that day, I have had the worst panic/anxiety disorder. I've been dying a little day by day it feels like trying to ""feel normal"" again because I know what normal feels like and I'm far from it nowadays. I was on Mirtazapine for a year, it helped but i felt like it made me foggy headed, dizzy, disoriented. I weened myself off of it and I've also been on clonazepam 0.5mg (twice daily) for a little over a year. Today was my first day on duloxetine and i have been unbelievably light headed, blurred vision and actually fainted at work. I know people say the first few weeks can be hell on a new medication but anyone dealing with similar symptoms on this medication because if I don't find a medication that makes me feel normal again then idk what I'm going to do. My quality of life is terrible and I feel like a zombie each and every day. Thank you!"

Anxiety,anxiety that comes and goes for seemingly no reason?,"I have anxiety but for some reason I don't feel like I relate to a lot of the way people describe their anxiety. I've often thought it must be something else but I don't know what it could be. 

A tense, jittery unease will often come over me completely unprovoked. my chest will get tight. my body gets weak. my head/scalp feels tense. it kind of feels like the inside of my body is crying or needs to cry, but not an outward feeling that I need to cry, if that makes sense. I've always interpreted that feeling as ""anxiety"" although I don't categorize it as an ""anxiety attack"". 

it usually will fade away after 20 minutes or so if I'm not in a chaotic environment, and then i will feel very calm and relaxed and at peace. 

I have plenty of things that I feel stressed or anxious about but they rarely affect me in the moment. the worst bouts of anxiety often come out of nowhere and totally unprovoked. it's very frustrating for it to come over me when I feel at peace, or doing a basic task that isn't directly giving me anxiety. I would rather feel this way doing something that would ""trigger"" it bc at least I could feel prepared for it. or I would know what to avoid. and I could enjoy my non anxious time without knowing it could hit at any moment.

is there something else this could be?"

Anxiety,How to help my partner dealing with anxiety over being sick ?,"TW: Mention of the Pandemic and covid

Basically the tittle but I will go into some details so you have an idea of what's going on. 
So my partner has anxiety, since day 1, it's no secret, and I've tried my best to help him out. 
But with the pandemic it has gotten significantly worse, he was never really afraid of being sick, but now he is terrified of potentially catching covid, and he has once in fact, and this is where it gets tricky. 
When he fell sick he did have a pretty big reaction, he fainted once in the middle of the night on the toilet (important detail), and I luckily had the time to catch him and call an ambulance. This was a stressful event to say the least, but luckily his fainting was nothing severe and the doctor reassured him. 
But now he is terrified of catching covid again, and of being sick in general, of going to the toilet alone (I sometimes have to be there), and even to be alone at home (because he could catch covid, then go to the toilet and faint). 

I don't know how to help him out with this fear, it's getting to a point where he's obsessed by it, going to the toilet is now riddled with anxiety and so is being alone. What could I do ? Try to explain how this precise situation is a rare occurrence? Try to give him tips of what he could do if it happens? 

It's not his only fear, but it's one that he can't control and so he's obsessing over it. He admitted that this fear is linked to the fear of dying, but I don't know how I could deal with this."
Anxiety,i am anxious about meeting my bf,"I don't know whyyyyyy, I love him n i miss him very much n want to spend all my days with him but idk I get anxious when I actually have to meet him, I think I might have social anxiety disorder too


Or I thinking why I'm anxious is because I have lie to my parents to meet him, n don't want them to know or get caught

N  i really want to meet him but kinda feel guilty because I get anxious coz it seems that I don't"
Anxiety,I cope and still find my anxiety debilitating,"I use my coping all day, I don’t usually stop because I want it to work effectively to where I see results. So I repeat them rapidly, but I do this to see results, it also seems as the more I try to relax and be positive is the more my body goes against itself and multiplies the anxiety like a fire being more flamed by gasoline. Another thing I do is I always focus on one more heavily than the other, it’s never equally spread out, just always tense about wanting results and have tend to quit multiple times in the past due to not being able to be resilient and confident as I would want myself to be no matter how hard I try. I don’t believe exposure is the best method of handling it either because when I try to I end up just wanting to itch every part of my body nonstop or not do it all because of the strength of the panic. I’ve found that breathing and positive affirmations can help me but it seems like I have to do these things and more problems will disobey when I see others reactions towards how severe it can still be while I do these thing."
Anxiety,Others feelings and emotions towards me become too much to handle,"I feel as if i’m going insane from the amount of impact others thoughts and feelings have over me. I can’t seem to brush it off whenever I’ve disappointed someone or hurt someones feelings by accident. It completely consumes me, to where I can’t function throughout the day. I start to panic, then have a meltdown, then feel super low for the rest of the day. All I want is to be a good person, I try so hard. I know it’s inevitable to make mistakes, but I just become so engulfed by the guilt and sadness from them. 

People say that it’s impossible to make everyone happy…and they are right. But how can I carry on my day normally when someone is upset with me? How do I start fully caring for myself? I feel that if I ever were to create a barrier to protect me from others emotions, I would be called rude or uncaring. I feel like I can’t win. I just want to be able to breathe when my parents, friends, or loved ones are upset with me. I really need some guidance."
Anxiety,help :(,"i’m so so scared, i never asked to be born and to be conscious on this hell we call earth. i’m really really tired, i’m every way imaginable. and i’m tired of animal abuse being so common in our society, i’m vegan but i feel helpless seeing what animals go through, it genuinely makes me cry every single day, i feel sick. 
tw: i have severe ocd and also existential panic so sometimes i question if anything is real at all (dpdr), if this is a fragment of my imagination, if there’s some entity above torturing me. what if every thing around me is an illusion and i’m stuck here forever? what if reincarnation is real? i want to be mad at my parents for bringing me here, but maybe they didn’t, maybe my soul was bound to anyways? i just want my death to be nothingness. sorry, this is all over the place, i am terrified though. nobody knows what happens when we die and in the meantime i hate living in this world"
Anxiety,help please,So I've been wanting to tell my parents about my anxiety  and panic attacks but I don't know how to do it. What if they're disappointed in me and wouldn't love me anymore?
Anxiety,Intuition vs Anxiety (Relationships),"I’ve been in my current relationship for a year. It’s going well, we’re planning to move in together in a few months. I love my partner, they make me happy, I enjoy spending time with them, they’re understanding and compassionate, I feel safe and calm around them. But for some reason I have this doubt, and it’s oddly persistent, which is why I worry it’s my intuition telling me something is wrong. 

The doubt/anxiety has a few faces: “Am I really in love with them?” “Are these small things that bother me too much?” “Am I really happy?” 

The “am I really in love” one is the most prominent. It’s honestly been around for most of our relationship. On paper I’m in love, but sometimes I think I’m missing that *feeling*. But I also know my idea of relationships is skewed by media/society. 

At this point I think most people would say it’s my intuition and I should just leave. It’s lasted so long. But first of all: I don’t want to leave. Second: A lot of this fear stems from my previous relationship, where I stayed much longer than I should have and against my intuition. I kept trying to convince myself it was okay. The difference is that in that relationship there were clear compatibility issues and I could list the things that were wrong. I can’t do that in my current relationship. But I think I’m hypersensitive to my intuition because I did ignore it once and I don’t want to do it again. But I also don’t want to lose an amazing relationship because of my anxiety and difficulty accepting the “what if”s and that I’ll never know if any relationship is perfect or The One, because that’s not real. 

Of course there’s also the part of me that’s worried my partner will break up with me out of nowhere, so I don’t know if my anxiety is trying to get ahead of being hurt. 

This is a very long post, but I’m looking for advice on how to tell if this is genuine or if it’s just my anxiety trying to sabotage me. I feel the anxiety in my body pretty often, but it melts away immediately when I’m with my partner. It pops up very occasionally if I start overthinking something, but for the most part it’s not present unless we’re not together, which I think is another point for it being anxiety. 

I’m sure I’m not the only person to struggle with this. I’m grateful for any advice."
Anxiety,My anxiety is at its worst,I feel as if my anxiety’s at its worse right now and I have never experienced severe chest pains and difficultly breathing before to such an extent. I feel like I’m on the verge of having a heart attack and that I can’t get up at times because of how intense the pain in my chest and throat is. It’s very weird because I am on summer break and done with school for the time being but never experienced such symptoms like this before. I would say I have nothing to really anxious about right know so I have no idea why I’m experiencing pain in my chest area all day now ://. I haven’t taken my medication in months but I feel like this might be a sign to get back on it. I just hate relying on medication to constantly make me feel better but I just want the pain to stop. I feel like going to a doctor wouldn’t be helpful if it does just end up being my anxiety and nothing more. If anyone has tips or advice I would greatly appreciate it.
Anxiety,Little sis has an interview…,"So, she is the most anxious, socially-nervous person I know (besides myself). Mainly bc she never had to do much, she never learned to do anything. Unfortunately, our mom passed last year and she got worse. I thought it was best for her to move in with me. It’s been 2 months and she has an interview tomorrow. Does anyone have advice? Tips? Words of encouragement? She is super anxious and I wanna be there for her as much as I can! I know you guys understand and I appreciate any words!"
Anxiety,It's 5PM! Time to bed sad!,"I've had anxiety before (2\~ years ago) that was brought upon by who knows what. I figure it's a culmination of many things -- work, life in general. Nothing out of the ordinary for me. Maybe it's just too much for me. My health reports are all clean.

Anyway, about the subject of this post: For the past week, starting at 5PM, my mood has gone from normal/happy to down... down... and down into worry (over what, I'm not sure), dread, and migraines. Happens over the course of an hour and either stays the same, or gets worse. Subsides at around 11PM. Note, I don't get migraines let alone headaches often.

Does anyone else go from having a normal day, which could even be fun, to suddenly down in the dumps like the snap of a finger? I just want this to stop."

Anyone up for a chat just DM me :)"
Anxiety,Boyfriend hung up in the middle of a call then suddenly stopped responding to me,"My bf and I were calling, just a normal phone call before bed. We were literally in the middle of a conversation (we weren't fighting or anything, I was literally talking about a TV show) when he just hung up. I figured the phone cut out or some thing so I called him right back. 

But he didn't pick up. I texted him, and asked what was up. He hasn't read or responded to my text, and it's been almost 2 hours. I texted him 4-5 times after that and tried calling again after an hour. No response. 

This is super unusual and now I'm just extremely stressed. What's going on? Did he get upset somehow? 

What should I do? Can someone please help calm me down because now I feel like I can't sleep and it's 1 AM on a work night. Why would he do this?? It's not like he's not responding cause he's busy or something we were about to go to bed and he literally hung up the phone...

I'm just super stressed and anxious someone calm me down please I don't know what to think. I need sleep but I just can't now..."

Anxiety,Scared of diabetes.,"I’m so embarrassed to write this, but I have a fear of diabetes properly because I’m scared it means I have something wrong with my pancreas. 

I wake up many mornings feeling very dehydrated and disoriented, also this morning I felt dehydrated but still went out to pee twice in like an hour, many mornings especially if I haven’t slept well I also have a headache. 

All this is causing morning anxiety, and that is very new to me, always been a night time anxiety girl lol."
Anxiety,AITA? Untreated mother-in-law is driving me up the wall.,"So I had an argument with my husband last night about his mom. She is EXTREMELY plagued with anxiety. It controls her whole life but she refuses to seek treatment. The closest thing she’s gotten to treatment has been ketamine infusions that she’s started lately mostly for chronic pain. 

Why this matters to me is because she is the most needy human being on the planet and everyone in their family just enables her. She calls my husband multiple times a day to complain about this that or the other and throws all her anxieties on him. And after 5 years of being married to him, and both of us getting treatment for anxiety, I’ve finally had enough. 

So tomorrow she wants us to go to her ketamine infusion. My husband went the first time and apparently she had a panic attack the whole time, refused anxiety meds, and it took 3 times longer than it should have. That being said, I’m pretty sure if it goes that way I’m not going to do well. 

I have mentioned to him multiple times in the past that if I was there I would tell her to take the meds or I’m leaving because I wouldn’t want to have an attack too. But when I tell him again tonight he thinks I’m going to blow up the whole situation and said I’m only doing this to “get control”.

I have never been anything but kind, courteous, and a good daughter-in-law so when he said that I was genuinely hurt. So random citizens, am I the asshole?"
Anxiety,I can never sleep,"I am currently up at 4 am for the 6th night in a row. I end up falling asleep around 5/6 am then wake up at 1. I know I shouldn’t do it but I can never sleep. Eventually my body just gives in and I pass out but it takes forever. 

I have a lot of circumstantial anxiety one being my current living situation. I absolutely hate my landlord and he’s made my life hell. I don’t feel safe in my own home and feel trapped that I can’t get out of the lease. I know this contributes to me not sleeping but I just don’t know what to do. 

I see a psychiatrist and have an appointment in a couple weeks. I’ve taken a lot of sleep medications and one worked pretty well but gave me that nasty hangover feeling. I have a counseling appointment scheduled a few weeks away as well but I’m just wondering what I can do in the meantime. Does anyone have advice?"

Anxiety,"Seroquel for sleep, reviews?","Hi there, 
Having major sleeping anxiety (scared that I will not sleep well) and my doc prescribed me seroquel 25mg. Worked very well for 2 weeks, but it one time did not and I panicked and stopped using it. This was last week. Doc now advices me to start using Seroquel 50mg again, since I have not slept in 3 days (2hrs per night). Other nights I’ve used a benzo.
I want to give it a try but I am SO scared that it will not work and that I will be sleepless again, that it’s hard for me to start. Maybe this sound weird, but I’m overly focussed on sleep and since I have not sept these days, I am in full panick mode. 

Are there people that have a good experience with seroquel as a seeping aid? Does it stop working after a while or will I be ‘safe’ when I use it?"
Anxiety,Anxiety Can Make You a Bad Decision-Maker. Here’s How You Can Get Better at Making Wiser Choices,[removed]
Anxiety,Is it just me or does it feel like everyone’s out to get me?,"I struggle to maintain new friendships and potential relationships because of the fact that my brain automatically believes that people are out to “hurt” me and in their nice facade, they’re looking for ways to break my heart.

For example, I met these friends (and I’m trying to be as honest with myself as possible so I’m sorry if these things sound weird or unreal to you but this is how I feel), but I talk quite a lot to them. For some reason, my brain  automatically thinks that they’re just being nice to me so that they could bully me later on and poke fun at me and ditch me last minute.

In my romantic relationships, I have something with a girl right now and she smiles at me and is really nice to me and greets me. Her and her friends laugh and snicker around me, I immediately think that they’re laughing at how stupid I am and that the girl is just being nice to me but in reality, she hates my guts and wants me to go away even though she does things that indicate she doesn’t.

It’s a headache to deal with. I just feel like everyone wants to hurt me, wants to get me vulnerable so they can poke at me and hurt me."

Anxiety,panic disorder recovery day 6,"Well it came on last Friday. I've used this space as a journal before and found it helpful so I'm returning to see how it goes.

I had such a good week but came on suddenly Friday morning. A panic attack out of the blue. Enough to trigger the fear and depression. The unwelcome visitor is back again.

I can't deny that I am handling this episode so much better than previous episodes. I've managed to keep up a rough routine involving showering breakfast a walk and work on reduced hours (work are brilliantly understanding).

Some highlights to give myself credit for:
Felt a strong sense of dpdr during a work meeting. I relaxed into it, no freak outs, no clock watching, let time pass, I made it easier for myself.

I've been going through a CBT for anxiety work book. Its amazing how many sneaky 'catastrophic' thoughts go unnoticed under the radar. I've been catching them, rescripting them and letting them go. Its not making me feel any better, and there are many of them to address, but its work for tomorrow me.

The dreaded morning anxiety wasn't that bad this morning. I just lay there, let my heart beat, let the discomfort travel through me. I paid it less attention. 

I know when the anxiety lifts so will the depression. Hoping this will be an easier shorter ride. Looking forward to the challenges of tomorrow. Bring it on."
Anxiety,Constantly worried about boyfriend?,"A little backstory, I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 10 months now. In the beginning everything was great. I’ve had slight anxiety before but it was nothing bad enough to worry about. 

A few months ago, in February I found out I was pregnant. We mutually decided to end the pregnancy. I thought we would go back to how we were prior which was a very casual and relaxed relationship but things for me have changed. I’m constantly worried about my boyfriend getting hurt or being killed. I break down in tears when he leaves my home and it’s even worse if he doesn’t let me know he’s reached home okay. I panic so much especially if he doesn’t reply in a timely manner and I’m always needing reassurance about everything particularly my looks, my weight and if I’m doing enough. 

I feel horrible because I know some of the things I panic about isn’t a big deal. I just wish I could rewind the time and go back to not obsessing over wondering if he ate three times today and had his vitamins."

So can someone tell me if it's okay to stay as long as I want or what the appropriate time to leave might be? Thanks!"
Anxiety,My anxiety is uncontrollable when I have to work,"Whether it's the night before or a couple hours before my shift, I cannot get my anxiety under control.

I've had anxiety since I was around 12 or 13. It developed after years of relentless bullying at school. I am now 29.
It used to be much worse - I used to not be able to leave the house on my own, but after CBT via my GP a few years ago, and working on my issues on my own, I managed to regain some sense of normality in my life. I managed to get jobs etc and work somewhat normally over the past few years.

Recently, I relocated to a different country from my home (the UK) with my partner of 11 years, and I have just landed my first job. It's in retail, which I've worked in before, but caused me massive amounts of anxiety. Other jobs have, too, but retail seems to trigger me more than anything else.

I've done a few shifts at my new job so far, and everything seems alright. I've made people aware of my anxiety as this brings me some comfort and helps build understanding between my colleagues and I. 

But every night before a working day, and every morning before I start my shift, I get uncontrollable and crippling anxiety. My heart rate goes sky high, I get such bad nausea that, more often than not, I will at least heave and maybe vomit, too. I can't even eat before I start work because of how much of a shambles my stomach is in. I had diarrhea and I shake constantly. 

My partner is immensely supportive. He has given me some brilliant ideas on how to visualise and manage my negative thoughts, and I'm trying to put those into action, but it seems no matter what I try - my partner's advice, meditation, planning as much as I can - nothing seems to calm me. 

I've had several breakdowns due to being mentally and physically exhausted from pushing myself so hard the past few days. I don't want to fail at this job. It's not what I wanted to do, but it works for me, and I'm doing well... But something's not working for me. 

I can't go to the doctor's here for help yet as I need to pay, and I'm currently broke (after months of waiting for my residency application to be accepted and not being allowed to work without it going through). And I've heard that even when I can go to the doctor's, there is a 1.5 year waiting list. 

I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have had similar experiences, and if you have any advice or ideas, or examples of things you used to help you. 

Apologies if I haven't given enough details or information for a decent context - I'm spirally pretty rapidly right now, but happy to answer any questions or anything.

Thank you in advance."
Anxiety,I finally got some work that can allow me to choose my own hours and work from home!,I have been chronically ill for 18 years now and the last 5 I have been stuck doing nothing with my life due to physical and mental health issues that have left me pretty much suicidal and housebound. I found a company that I started doing a few jobs for but they were primarily out on the street (market research/mystery shopping) so I can only do days that I am feeling up to walking about. But they have just announced they are looking for people to review those jobs from home and so I am applying! It has been great to be able to do some jobs out and about but this job would be amazing and I can do it from home any time. I wanted to share on here as it has really helped put me on a different path. I don't want to advertise the job on here but I also wanted to share it with you all as I'm sure there are plenty of you in a similar position. Please take this post down if it's not allowed but also feel free to reach out and I can send you a link. (It's in the UK and freelance so you would have to do taxes yourself).

Anxiety,Severe Anxiety just cost me another job.,"Ever since high school, whenever I would get a job I never lasted more than 2 days, and now that’s even less. I don’t know what it is about myself that won’t let me work. I want to work, I NEED to work, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I get a severe fight or flight response and and just start thinking the worst ways out of my situation. I feel like such a loser and can’t believe this is happening again."
Anxiety,Can’t sleep because I’m anxious about having to wake up early,"Whenever I know I have to wake up early, I can’t seem to fall asleep. It is really silly, I know. But I just spend all night thinking “shit I have to get up so early. I’ll be so tired throughout the day”. And then I don’t sleep.

Next week I’m going on a trip. I’ve been waiting to go for years I am SUPER excited. Like when I think about it, it feels like electricity going through my body. This will make it incredibly hard to sleep (any tips on this would be appreciated). But on top of that, we have to be at the airport at 5am. I have to wake up at 3am. Meaning I will have to go to bed at like 8pm. But like I said, all I will be thinking about is how early I will have to be up. It makes me anxious to know that I have to be up at that ungodly time. Is this normal? Does anyone have any advice?"

Anxiety,finding a job with anxiety,"I graduate college in a year and have to start looking for a full-time job in about two months for post-grad. I have been a complete mess the last couple of days because of it. The mere thought of sending out applications and doing interviews (which I do not have a lot of practice for) terrifies me and I lose sleep over it. I have cried no less than once a day because of it. 

It really sucks because I know I also have to do it to secure a job. I am the first college graduate in my family and I don’t want to let my parents down. There’s also all the student loans I have to pay back.

It feels like there’s no way out of this — and there really isn’t any — because both the idea of interviewing and the prospect of being unemployed are equally terrifying. I don’t even know where to start on my job search.

I’m just so tired of this feeling of being trapped and it feels like none of my peers understand."
Anxiety,Metoprolol and Clonazepam interactions?,"f,29. (Diabetic, Hashimoto's) I was on metoprolol 25mg for the last three months. Today my dose was increased to 50 mg split twice. I also have to take clonazepam.25mg at night. My dose was increased because I was not getting any sleep, although my doc had prescribed clonazepam then as well, I didn't take any due to the fear of them interacting. But my sleep just got fucked since then and my anxiety and heart rate increased slowly due to sleeplessness. I have very bad health anxiety. I was thinking of first taking only the clonazepam tonight. And if my heart rate becomes normal in a couple of days with that, I will not take 25mg metoprolol at all. Has anyone had any experience with these two drugs? My doc said it's completely safe and not to worry.

I am due to get my Thyroid panel done, my doc suspects my sleeplessness could also be due to a high dose of synthroid. But for tonight, I am nervous. Help."
Anxiety,Let your light shine!,"Congrats /r/anxiety we've all made it to Wednesday!

This is a weekly thread that serves as a place for us to shine some light on what is going well in our lives. It is easy for mental health subreddits to focus primarily on the negative, after all we're not here because everything is going wonderfully.

But, once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right. So whether you made it out of bed today, spoke up in a meeting or class, rode the bus, or just stepped outside please share with us what went well for you in the past week.

Any accomplishment, victory, positive thought or action no matter how big or small is welcome here!"
Anxiety,Really anxious about interview,"I have a really important job interview in two hours and I’m SO nervous and stressed. I need to get this job super badly. I have no money and I need a second job.

If anyone could please leave so some support and encouragement I need it. I really wanna cry."
Anxiety,Scared about brain tumor,"I’m 24M and normal height/weight. 4 days ago while on vacation I started getting headaches on the left side of my head. Also, my left leg and left arm started feeling weak. These headaches and weak feeling on one side of my body still last after I sleep and start again after I wake up in the morning. Of course, I get super scared and the first thing I think about is a stroke or brain tumor. 

But I can still walk and lift things normally. I’m able to talk and function through these headaches. Even though I still have headaches on my left side and my left arm/left leg still feel weak to this day. Can anxiety cause symptoms like one sided headaches and weakness?"
Anxiety,Advice for finding a Psychologist?,"I've been struggling with my anxiety for years and I've decided it's finally time to seek help.  My whole life, I've always had a hard time asking for help so this is a big step for me.  So I'm wondering, what is the best way to find a psychologist? I've already gone to Psychology Today and used filters to reduce the list, but now what? There are still a ton of names and they don't really have reviews online for me to consult.  How do I continue to narrow the list? And also what are some tips for the first appointment? I've generally been a pretty closed off person so I know I'll need to open up, but what are some other tips so I can get the most out of the session? Any tips and advice would be really appreciated."
Anxiety,Just a question?,Is anybody on disability for thier anxiety? I live in Canada and I've heard that you can now get disability for severe anxiety. Just want to know what the process is or if it is even possible?
Anxiety,I arrive on site for a new job today! I’m VERY anxious.,"And excited! But mostly terrified right now. I’ve done jobs like this before, I like new experiences and living in different places. But this has me WAY more anxious for some reason. I won’t have cell or consistent internet, and the closest town may be a couple hours away. I want this to go well, but idk what work conditions will be like, idk who my coworkers/roommates will be, idk how cut off I’ll be from friends/family.

It’s just overwhelming me right now. I’d love some encouraging words or advice, if anyone has any. I’m just trying to calm myself down a bit."
Anxiety,Does anyone else ever get a random overwhelming feeling of Deja Vu so intense it makes you physically nauseous? I'm thinking anxiety and stress could trigger it but would love to hear others experiences!,
Anxiety,Work associated with the judgement of other people is very difficult,"After restructuring my life, I've become quite good at doing work in a vacuum (work that only impacts me and only I will see). However the moment anything I do can be linked to or percieved by another person, especially if it's something they're depending on, my tendancy to be avoidant resurfaces massively.

It's really bizarre, because I will feel strong guilt/shame for working on something which only benefits everyone involved. If I self-sabotage and avoid responsibilities relating to other people, the guilt/shame goes away. Totally backwards, and I can't for the life of me, rationalize myself out of it."
Anxiety,Buspar experience question,"I know the topic of buspar has been discussed a lot over the years, but I can’t seem to find an answer to my question, so here goes. 

My wife started buspar about a week ago. She’s taking 7.5mg 2x a day. So far it has made her anxiety worse and her panic attacks more frequent. She wants to quit and I think she needs to give it more time. 

My question is really to those who have taken it and your anxiety got worse but you stuck with it: did it get better? If it’s worse at first, is it worth sticking it out?"
Anxiety,"For those that take Magnesium to help with their anxiety, what is the best form of it?","I see that they have regular pills made by Nature Made, a drink mix, gummies, etc. I will be taking it in the morning to help with the anxiety I have throughout the day. 

I've just seen some people here said they've had really good success with it so I'd love to know what you guys are taking."
Anxiety,What is happening to me? Anxiety/Dissociation,"Hi All,

Hoping someone can give me some guidance. I have dealt with chronic anxiety for as long as I can remember, I was a generally anxious kid and I deal with trauma in my formative years which I believe really exacerbated the issues I deal with today. Its pretty much constant - overthinking, obsessive/intrusive thoughts, GAD, panic attacks etc.. I deal with it all pretty much at a constant rate. This has left me drained for many years now and losing hope.

The past few weeks has been to a different level and this is why I am asking some advice - I think i am dealing with dissociation? I cant really explain the feeling I am having. Everything feels very foreign, I have lost my sense of self, existential thoughts all over the place, feel like a grey veil in front of me at all times, have trouble caring/concentrating on anything. Its the strangest feeling I have ever had and I wish I could give a better explanation but I cant. My question - is this dissociation? How do you all deal with this normally and what is happening to actually cause this? Its causing me extreme anxiety. Any help at all would be incredible as I am really really struggling right now and beginning to lose hope on how to fix this."

Anxiety,severe anxiety on being behind in life,"I recently turned 25, and at this age I've had an immense fear of being behind in life. I don't know to drive, I work three jobs to make ends meet, I haven't had anyone serious in my life, and I feel like I haven't amounted to anything. I look around at my peers/friends and they are celebrating graduating with a Masters, getting engaged,buying a home, or having their first child. I am no where near that stage in my life but it often feels like I should be. I often panic that I'm not where I should be and causes me to spiral into severe depression and anxiety. I want to be ahead in life and I often speculate that I may never reach that stage because I'm so behind everyone else in my life."
Anxiety,How can I support my partner who has anxiety?,"Hi guys :) my partner quite commonly get anxiety over certain things, and they even cause small panic attacks.

Anxiety,Can't stop thinking about what ifs,"This is extremely exhausting, and it's almost like I'm just trying to make my anxiety worse on purpose. 

A few weeks back when I had a morning flight my alarm didn't go off that morning for some reason. Well, I woke up 45 minutes late but still made it. Didn't even have to rush.

But now I can't stop thinking ""what if I hadn't woken up? what if I woke up not 45 minutes but 2 hours later?"" 

This is what I do everytime something similar happens, especially with close-calls. And I can't stop it, I just can't seem to accept the fact that I'm okay and nothing bad happened. It's just constant what ifs and I'm so tired of me doing this to myself."
Anxiety,Switching anxiety medications,"So sorry if this is long but I’m having severe anxiety about this- so for two days I completely forgot to take my lexapro. Now it’s time for me to half my dosage as I’m switching to a new medication- but I’m so concerned that I’m dying because I forgot my dose for two days or that I’m going to get Seratonin syndrome. And also it doesn’t help that my anxiety was already increasing as I wean off my old medicine- so like I was on 40mg and I took only 20mg today. So it was two days with no medicine because I forgot and now one day with 20mg. 

I feel like I’m having a heart attack and I’m so dizzy. Which I read can happen with withdrawal but I’m like convinced I’m dying- plz just tell me it’s the anxiety and this is gonna stop bc I’m so scared something is wrong."

Anxiety,"severe anxiety before psych appointment, what do I do?","I commonly have terrible anxiety before and during appointments which lead to me not saying much and not getting what I need. I've been taking meds for a couple years and have been on and off a lot. My fear is to say what I at least think I want. But my fear is that I'll sound like Im just there for pills. Where obviously thats not the case and I'm aware but in my head I can't stop worrying. For anti anxiety I'm taking Clonazepam. Last appointment I got it upped to 2 a day. But they don't help. They're weak, they don't work. Ive already taken one this morning and my gut is churning for anxiety. What I want is to ask if I can switch to lorazepam. I had it in a mental health facility and it's been the only thing to actually stop my anxiety and let me relax. I'd even be able to take one and it would last like 2 days. But it's ""highly addictive"" and all that jazz. Which I've been through and I'm not worried at all about that. It's normal for me to ask isn't it? I've had too many doctors look and speak to me like I'm a drug addict, so I also have pretty bad ptsd from that yet this is a different doctor who's always been nice. I just clam up and go along with whatever he interprets from my mumbling :("

Anxiety,Anxiety getting associated with external things,"I have been having on and of anxiety for the past ~5 years. Sometimes bad, usually manageable. The bad times usually dont last for more than a few weeks.


My anxiety always seems to get associated with something (lets call it thing x) in the environment or my life situation. To such a degree that I feel like this thing x is driving me crazy, if only thing x didn't exist I would feel good. 


This started first at feeling of draft in my apartment in the winter. It was driving me crazy until I suddenly stopped caring about a few months after. Then it was anxiety about a minor chronic health problem  for about a year (which wasn't new and didn't bother me before and doesn't really bother me currently)


Recently the thing x has been traffic noise (I live near a busy street). I have been thinking about moving to a more quiet place. But my current place is otherwise great. And if my theory is correct, it is not the noise which gives me anxiety, but my anxiety is getting associated with the noise.


Does this kind of anxiety association have some name? Or is it even a thing? I would hate to move to a more quiet apartment only to have my anxiety return in some other form."

Does it make anybody else feel nauseated/ sick to their stomach 98% of the time? I constantly feel ill and i’ve had loads of testing so there’s nothing physically wrong with me but I’m thinking it could be the phobia?

Today is the last day I can do it.

Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like they are so behind in life?,"I don’t care about anything, i can’t remember anything, learning stuff is really hard because i can’t retain much info, reading is hard because i can’t pay attention or i have to reread lines a hundred times, i have no motivation to complete things even if they are super important, even if i’m good at something for once i manage to fuck it up or i think i’m a fraud or i don’t deserve anything. everything is just SO DIFFICULT. 

i feel like suffering from depression and anxiety from a young age has caused me to also be more immature and childlike because i feel like i spent most of my life just feeling like shit and being anxious that i couldn’t really experience true childhood and friendships and dating and going out and doing fun stuff and doing normal teen things. 

depression sucks. anxiety sucks. it’s so hard."
Anxiety,make your body a safe place to be!,"If your body wasn't a safe place to be, you learned to stay in your mind. that is  why you have anxiety dear one!"
Anxiety,I lied and it keeps catching up with me. Makes me want to hurt myself.,"Hi. I understand this may be a confusing post but 3 years ago I lied to my parents because I didn’t want them to hate me. They would be so so so disappointed in their only kid and we already didn’t have a great relationship. This thing comes up once a year, they ask me for a certain document and it doesn’t exist. 

Telling the truth is not an option. It just keeps killing me slowly. I wish I had done better in the first place so I wouldn’t have to lie. My heart feels like it’s going to jump out of my body. The truth is that they could call up this place and ask for a copy of the document and figure out the truth in a second. So I’m always going to live with that fear. I just wanted to make them proud and I never have. If they knew I was a liar it would destroy everything. (I basically never lie, except for this thing) 

Again, I’m sorry for not explaining everything properly. I just am not doing well currently and it makes me want to physically hit myself. That’s how I used to cope. I would slap myself to punish myself for fucking up in the first place and dig my nails into my hands. I don’t want to do that but it’s the only way I can distract myself from my heart racing."
Anxiety,Anxiety has become too crippling and is affecting every aspect of my life,"I have bad anxiety and I cannot live like this anymore. Therapy is not helping and I dont know what to do.

It affects everything and I had a wake up call at work this week. We have regular check ins with our manager and long story short they basically said im not preforming well (which is true). 

I guess this was the one thing in my life I felt somewhat confident about. My manager pointed out im constantly overthinking everything and its making things way harder for me. I always assume the worst about everything and misinterpret things all the time about everything and everyone inside and outside work.

Ive had other people point out these issues throughout my life like some of my professors. They would tell me im smart just having no confidence or self esteem.

I mostly just accepted it and lived through it but now that its affecting my work and im in danger of losing my job I cant continue like this anymore. I think im going to have to go on meds I dont see another way out of this.

On the weekends or when I have nothing to do I get really drunk and/or really high to basically shut my brain off. I have developed a binge eating problem and have gained like 10 pounds. 

Im moving cross country soon and instead of preparing I get scared and just shut down with the above coping mechanisms.

I cant live like this anymore and dont know what to do."
Anxiety,I just cannot calm down for the life of me. I'm scared for nothing and everything,"I don't know what to even flair this. I guess I'd love advice if anyone knows how to handle this, or support or just talking about it occasionally on the internet  


I have this sense of impending doom and gloom with me frequently and it only gets worse if I sense any small danger. I could have specific triggers but I'm unsure of that, I haven't identified them fully. It's really bizarre because I feel as if I have anxiety over success and happiness. I always feel like it's gonna be taken away from me and that makes me not bother for it  


I remember when I was gonna go watch a movie with a friend and I was hyped for it but shortly after I just became very anxious for some reason. Another time I bought something for myself and I was really happy but then again a bit later I became afraid. It looks like I'm scared of just. everything. including happiness and peace of mind, because I have an internal fear that maybe it wasn't even meant for me :( ironically, this is what won't let me be to an extent. I can't study or improve like this"

Anxiety,Keto diet helped unexpectedly helped my mental health,"I have been on keto for about a month now and for the past two weeks I've started to feel so much better. I started enjoying little things more and I'm just overall happier even though nothing else in my life changed. I didn't expect keto to do this, I'm on a diet to have more energy and lose some weight so this isn't a placebo effect. Just thought I should share this so others would consider it, too."
Anxiety,Constant Shortness of Breath. Doctors Say Anxiety,"This all started on Dec 14th, 2022. While relaxing and scrolling on my phone , my body took an involuntary shallow breath. That breath made me aware of my breathing. No chest tightness or anything of the sort. Just aware of my breathing like a manually having to breath feel. I immediately assumed it was anxiety and got up to finish something I needed to get done around the house. 
The feeling wore off and I went to sleep. I felt fine in the morning until I felt the involuntary shallow breath again. I tried distracting myself through the day again but it didn’t work so I took my inhaler that evening and dozed off to sleep. I woke up the next morning feeling the same way, best way to describe is manually breathing. The inhaler didn’t alleviate the symptoms so I decided to give it a bit more time and if it didn’t get better I’d go to the ER. Granted I’ve been to the ER more times than I would like to admit over the past 1 and a half years so I’ve tried to avoid unless ultimately necessary because they already believe that my symptoms stem from anxiety. I went to the ER and nothing was found. I was told anxiety again. This feeling stayed consistent, even causing problems with sleep, for about a week until I forced myself to sit in the feeling for what felt like hours and it went away for about a week.

Fast forward this happened about  3 more times for about 1 week-2 week spans coming on randomly and going away only once I sat in it and told myself it was anxiety. My inhaler did not work at any point in time. It probably made the situation worse when I did try.

In Feb, I began having a bit of an asthma flare. My asthma is weird because I don’t wheeze. It comes on as a bit of chest tightness that is relieved with an inhaler. My body would then alternate between needing my inhaler for tightness one day and then no tightness another day
but noticing my breathing but the inhaler not alleviating symptoms.My doctor started me on Symbicort to control the flare and stated that the noticing breathing was anxiety.

I’ve been dealing with this battle since then but it has completely ramped up since April 11th, 2022. I’ve had constant difficulty breathing/ manual breathing since that day. I’m not out of breath, I just can’t breathe regularly. Sometimes chest tightness that moves around and tightness in my diaphragm: stomach area. My inhaler does not alleviate the symptoms. My peak flow has remained around my baseline. Highest 390, doesn’t drop below 350. I’ve went to the ER for nebulizer treatments, taken prednisone, taken Symbicort. Even tried anti gas and anti acids since I’ve had some burping and doctors thought gerd might be a cause. Nothing has worked. All blood work has come back normal, d-dimer normal. X-rays are normal. Oxygen normal. Heart rate is sometimes a little elevated but I’ve been told it’s because of anxiety.Doctors are tired of me because they believe it’s anxiety but breathing exercises and anti-anxiety meds haven’t helped. I’ll be starting a low dose of SSRI’s this week just to completely check off the anxiety idea.

Im not completely bed ridden and I am able to go out with friends , socially drinking, and work since I work from home but I still have the difficulties. I’m not paying attention to them as much and it may go away for a few but it will still resurface. My sleep has been drastically affected, the difficulty is constant and worsened by sitting down or laying down.  

I’ve had x rays(May 8th most recent), ekgs (May 8th most recent), holter monitors( August 2021 most recent), chest ct scans (October 2021 most recent), abdominal ct(June 2021 most recent) stress tests(August 2021 most recent) echos(July 2021 most recent, edoscopy and colonoscopy(July 2021)blood work(May 2022 most recent) , PFT(January 2022) Everything normal comes back normal outside of mild anemia and an SVT episode caught on a monitor when I was kept for observation in late July because I was feeling off.

I don’t know what else to do. I’m not opposed to anxiety but I don’t see how anxiety can manifest in this way with no relief from calming measures.


TLDR: Constant difficulty breathing since April 2022. Inhaler, nebulizer, prednisone, anti-acids and anti-gas not providing relief. Tests come back normal.Doctors say anxiety"

I’ve convinced myself I have afib or SOMETHING wrong with my heart. It goes fast and then pounds and then seems to slow too much?? I think? I got an ekg and it was normal, and I’m now wearing a 72 hour holter monitor, but I just. I cant. I’ve started getting dizzy, and idk what’s normal. My friend who doesn’t have anxiety says she sometimes feels her heart flutter/pound but quickly forgets about it. So idk. Do any of y’all relate???😭"
Anxiety,Obsessive scalp picking,"I pick my scalp obsessively, but I only do it about once a year or every two years. 

I take Zoloft and it really helps me stop picking. I only pick when my anxiety is so bad that I HAVE to.

I’m actually currently having a picking  episode. When I do pick I pick until it gets so infected that I have swollen lymph nodes, and  there’s  nothing but pus oozing out of my wounds. I then go to a doctor, and get it surgically cleaned because the infection is so bad. They then give me topical antibiotics and it’s so oily and slippery that I can’t pick."
Anxiety,The plight of writing papers,"I had never had to write a research paper until this week and this has been extremely challenging and triggering, regarding my anxiety. It has kept me from doing other school work that is also urgent.

Anxiety,Advice for how to most effectively communicate with psychiatrists?,"I have a habit of downplaying my symptoms to just about every kind of medical professional; I joke about or describe things really casually to avoid feeling like a burden because I crumble under pressure and can be very easily convinced that I’m exaggerating. [I had to have an emergency surgery in December of 2020 because of a medical problem that I kept convincing myself that I was exaggerating the severity of; the surgeon ended up asking me how I had possibly waited so long to address it] I saw a psych 4 years ago thinking I had ADHD and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, was put on Prozac and never felt any change in my behavior or moods, and since stopped taking it back in 2020.
I’ve started having panic attacks frequently within the past 6 months and I think its becoming serious; not only because of my mental state but because the only way I’m able to calm myself down to any manageable place is by using my dwindling supply of hydros and tramadol from the previously mentioned surgery. From my own self medicating and coping methods, I’ve found that something that helps me quickly calm my body and retrieve my mind so I can regain control has been extremely effective like nothing else I’ve tried. I think a prescription of something like a Benzodiazepine could really really help me at this point, but obviously I can’t tell this to a psychiatrist. How can I go about a conversation like this with a psychiatrist without them just restarting me on a different SSRI?"
Anxiety,I finally understand what constant day in day out anxiety feels like.,I’ve always considered myself a pretty strong willed person. Someone thats “mentally tough”. But nowadays I have this deep gut feeling constantly eating away at me. Its made me lose my appetite. Im constantly restless and down in the dumps. Just thinking of certain things nowadays makes me want to hurl. And honestly this F’in sucks.
Anxiety,Is anyone else the mom friend (+ the one people come to with issues)?,"My friends make jokes about this kind of thing - like me making sure everyone has their ID where we’re headed, or that we’re not being too loud at a restaurant, etc. I don’t want to bother them with things like this, but I’d rather us just talk a little bit quieter instead of getting in trouble or annoying other customers. Also, so many people that I’m friendly/acquainted with at school come to me with issues that I think are more tmi or maybe ask your parent/teacher/use your own judgement. I don’t mind just giving a quick answer, but this happens pretty often and I was wondering if it’s because I’m anxious about that kind of thing and maybe I come off as overly caring or smthg? Like at my sports practices people come to me about injuries, headaches, feeling sick, tired, stressed, needing a bandaid, forgetting a water bottle… I really don’t care that much, but sometimes it’s awkward or just gives me another thing to worry about and I’m constantly wondering if I gave them the right advice yk? Idk but it’s been stuck in my mind recently. Also, I don't think I'm very helpful because I have a bad habit of never saying I'm certain about anything so I'm not sure why it seems like I'm the one to go to."
Anxiety,I worry I’ve been forgotten,"I started seeing someone a few months back, and our dates have been great and we were always texting and such when not together. We get on so well. Recently she’s been having a tough time in life - a new job role has given her a lot more stress, as with one of her daughters and now her grandad has died. We haven’t seen each other for a couple months because of it all, and texts have gotten less too. I feel a bit useless and she’s apologised that she’s “shit” which I’ve understood and said for her not to think this way. 

I know the normal side of my thinking realises she’s got her stuff going on, but then the anxiety (or the chimp if you’ve read the book) tells me she’s not interested anymore and won’t tell me so. I feel like I’m forgotten, even though I don’t deserve constant attention of course. I’m currently fighting with my brain and I kinda need support over this. Just to be told from a neutral alone will sort my brain out I feel. Please help as it’s driving me mad."
Anxiety,Bodily functions and anxiety,"Does anyone else just get anxiety for any physical feeling the body has? 

I will get sleepy and boom anxiety. I have to use the bathroom? Boom anxiety. Im hungry? Also anxiety. 

Its like my body has forgotten how to process the difference between actual anxiety and just normal everyday necessities…. 

Does anyone else experience this? Is this normal?? I actually have no clue."
Anxiety,my friends never buy me anything,I have my friend group.. I'd say their character is ok but very naive and immature most times but I prefer that than someone too mature and they would b a holes.. anyway I have agoraphobia and I have always struggled being with no money and I have this feeling that it bothers them. Because when I got agoraphobia aswell and couldnt work they cut me off and judged me for not being able to go to a specific place. Out of my comfort zone and they keep judging me for it. Yesterday I wasnt going out on sunday and they insisted to come over to my house without even asking. I said ok. And I told them honestly I wasn't going out this weekend and i had already told them. No matter how much I say no it's for nothing. So I make toast for my friend and they got comfortable etc. Than they expect me to make them pancakes. I refused. Anyway we get to KFC and they dont even pay for me 0 drinks. My female friend always takes me to.places but never ever buys me a drink. The guy just offers me 1 chips lol wtfff. So now even though I am unemployed I dont go out with them that much and they piss me the f off with their attitude.
Anxiety,Does Anyone Else Experience This?,"Hi, I’m (21F), and I think I might have anxiety but I have yet to seek a therapist. I wanted to hear from others who have experience in this disorder. I can’t tell if it’s my health or anxiety…My symptoms will happen randomly sometimes with no great provocation—sometimes days before the next and sometimes multiple in a day. It usually just happens when I think too much about things that I’m worried about I guess. No matter how many times I try to be level with myself, I can’t fight back the feeling. 
Throughout I feel panicky, it is hard to focus on any one thing and a wave of fear and nausea hits me. My jaw is clenched and my mouth is dry. My heart feels so fast. And it feels like I can’t thinking about it and that makes it all worse. Laying down and having my girlfriend comfort me helps. I find myself retreating to my quiet bed to calm down much more than I’d like. But the incidents are really wearing me down and I just want to feel…normal again and not so AFRAID of everything. I wasn’t like this a year ago…it just started up a couple months back. And since I’ve noticed it, it’s gotten worse. But I’m just afraid because I consider myself a mentally sound person—I’ve dealt with very stressful things. So why would anxiety act up now that I’m generally happy? 
If anyone can confirm my suspicions, or give helpful tips, I’d be extremely grateful."
Anxiety,Fear of driving alone,"So, I want to overcome my fear of driving alone. I got my driver’s license in November and since then, I only drove with my sister or with someone beside me. I’ve never tried to drive alone, because my mind has thoughts like “what if I don’t find a parking spot” or “what if I take a wrong turn”. Everyone says that I drive well, but I still didn’t try to drive alone."
Anxiety,med help or self help,"hey fam, ive been on and off having anxiety attacks for a few months now, worse after Cov,id.  One week ill have many anxiety attacks and next week ill be fine and nothing. I talked to my new GP and she prescribed me Quetiapine (nz) also known as Seroquel. however, i am such a Hypochondriac that im terrified to take the pills and after some research and reading here im more scared and i think im better off not taking them as ill be super super on edge that night and the next day from taking it.  She prescribed me half of the 25mg one so tiny amount but still anxious asf to take it.

Im not bipolar or anything i just have lil anxiety attacks where i want comfort and reassurance and to lay down and just cry. 

Leaning towards not taking them and just focusing more on self help skills during these attacks.

Just wanted to get this off my chest and if anyone had any anxiety advice for having attacks while at work and self help skills for me. TIA X"

Anxiety,"Driving after a seven month break, can't stand all the mistakes I make","As above I recently started driving again after a long break (no car), in a different country to boot. The different signs and sometimes confusing intersections have led to me making mistakes that I can't stop obsessing over. I'm terrified of hurting someone, I try to be cautious but it scares me to bits.

Like today I think I might have forgot to check my far side mirror when pulling out of park at a parking lot. I think it was because I was waiting for a dude on the front side of my car to finish walking past from that side of my windshield and afterwards I was just like, 'Oh it's clear now'. 

I also keep second guessing whether I properly checked an intersection was clear and the pedestrian crossings, and I'm not sure if it's just that some of that checking is somewhat subconscious from my previous driving experience, so I don't take a strong note of it in my mind.

I feel like I want to scream but I also want to keep driving as I'm in an area with a low speed limit and truly gorgeous countryside to drive through."

Anxiety,The day it all started,I am a dentist and was looking forward to do my post grad since the beginning of covid. It took me 2 years to clear the entrance exam and got to choose my desired subject. After securing the admission I was so happy but my world flipped as I joined my college and came to know about the course. I just found it impossible to do and got scared of it so much that I was constantly forgetting to even take my meals because of the shock that I am not able to do what I always wanted to do. I am in depression and having panic attacks since then. I am considering leaving the college as even thinking of going to college triggers panic Attacks which lasts the entire day and I can't do anything or anything about these attacks. Can someone give me some insights? I feel lost and I just want my life to end so that I can rest in peace.

Anxiety,Citalopram Or Celexa: Let's see if it is Safe During Pregnancy.,"Among the many antidepressants available, we will concentrate on the generic antidepressant Citalopram. Citalopram is most well known under the commercial name Celexa. Let us determine whether [Citalopram Or Celexa: Safe During Pregnancy?](https://druggist.online/citalopram-or-celexa-safe-during-pregnancy/)

Depression is a negative mood in which you feel low. You may or may not have a reason to be depressed. Depression causes a variety of complications in one's life. It has an effect on your thoughts, actions, and emotions. It also alters your viewpoint in life, allowing you to see things objectively.

Citalopram and other antidepressants can help you get back to normal. During the first few days of taking citalopram, you may experience drowsiness. It works by reintroducing serotonin (a naturally occurring chemical) into the brain. It belongs to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors class (SSRI). Celexa (Citalopram) is a medication used to treat depression in pregnant women.

**While Taking Citalopram, Can I Breastfeed?**

If you are breastfeeding, you can take Citalopram. For the first year, no negative effects were observed in breastfed infants. However, if you are lactating and breastfeeding your child while taking Citalopram, you should keep the following considerations in mind.

* Breastfeeding may be difficult for you.
* Breastfeeding may necessitate the assistance of others.
* You must keep an eye on the youngster for signs of excessive sleepiness.

Keep this in mind. It is preferable if you do not discontinue Citalopram abruptly. If you have an unanticipated pregnancy and are already on Citalopram, you should continue taking it during and after the pregnancy. It will not cause any harm to you or your child.

Is there any other danger to the baby?

Overall, Citalopram can be used to treat depression. The foetus is not at risk. For the first month, your infant may have the following issues:

* Irritability
* Respiratory issues
* Jitteriness
* Feeding difficulties

Anxiety,Do I have something other than anxiety?,"I’m new-ish to anxiety as an official thing I have, like maybe 2 years now. I have all the symptoms and looking back always have had them. What I wanna know is I feel like there’s nothing in particular that causes me extra anxiety. Sometimes it just happens to the point of nearing a panic attack but when I look back to try to pinpoint why I can’t think of what could have caused it. Recent ones that have happened I feel like literally the only thing I did was eat too much then a little later. Anxiety. Is this something anyone else has experienced? Do I have something else other than general anxiety that causes panic attacks. I got covid back in December and I feel like since then my anxiety symptoms come around more often and more  easily, could that have anything to do with it. I’m mostly just throwing this out without expectations of a real solution that easily but if you have thoughts I’m happy to listen."
Anxiety,Any tips on how to calm down after a bad convo with a friend?,"Hi, I'm Jay, I live with anxiety, adhd and some autism.  My therapist is unavailable at the moment, and I know the internet sounds silly to turn to as the next option, but I don't know who else to ask right now and I thought someone might have good advice.

Context:
[Last wednesday I was anxious about a small topic concerning one of my friends, and brought it up to him. We've known each other for a couple years now and been super close for the past year or so, talking very openly and supporting each other and it's been super great and helpful. But this time he reacted differently than usual, instead of his usual messages he talked a lot more cold and distanced, very formal kind of wording. It was weird and it freaked me out because it reminded me of a person who did a lot of traumatic stuff to me before. We talked about it but didn't manage to fully work it out just yet, in short it's a work in progress.]
I don't blame him for it and we've still been hanging out since, but the experience left me with a lot of fear.

 Consciously, I know that this isn't the end of the world, it's definitely an issue that can be worked out, nobody is mad at anyone, but I'm still just so so anxious.

My heart rate has been often higher than usual, I have trouble focusing and haven't slept well since. 

What I'm asking here is, does anyone have any tips on how to hold on better in the meantime? I have a huge exam coming up in less than two weeks, but the messed up sleep schedule and constant intrusive thoughts have been making it super hard to focus on anything. thank you very much in advance if you have something and decide to share with me"
Anxiety,Left my job second day…,"I dont know how to even start this…

Im 20, male, studying political science but took a break because of my mental problems.

Ive been dealing with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts for a very long time. These past months ive been hospitalised 2 for OD on drugs and attempted suicide. Both times spent 30 days at the psychward.

I got out, it didnt help. Still feeling terrible. Anyways, my prents told me to find a job and after 2 months of looking for one, finally someone responded. Its a house depot store, where they sell anything requiered to build a house, paints, etc.

I was happy but very nervous since this job needs you to speak with clients and explain the difference between paints ir cement etc. I know nothing about such things, but tried the job anyways.

It was hell. They told me they will teach me everything, but the guy just gave me a 20 minute tour around the shop and just told me to start working. So I did, but once people started coming in and asking me questions I just shut down… I couldnt answer since I didnt have any clue on what is what. I was running around asking for help from other workers, but they either denied it or told me to figure it out myself.

Anyways, first day went over and I was just sad. Over the weekend I so badly didnt want to go to work, vut pushed myself and went today. About an hour in I was just walking around the store, trying to understand where is each thing placed, the manager came in and started speaking with the guy that was in charge of me. I didnt hear everything, but I heard that he was tellung her that I was lazy, didnt do anything, and Initally should not be working here.

I heard that, got very upset. I was trying my best and man… anyways, after thinking about it for an hour, I just went up and told her that I feel like this job isnt for me. I just quit the job. She told me not to worry, cause its deffinitely not for everyone.

Anyways, came home, my parents yelled at me. And I am looking for a new job. Something that has nothing to do with building and construction.

Just feeling sad and dissapointed."

Anxiety,How do you calm down your general anxiety?,"I am not diagnosed but I feel like I have general anxiety. I dont have any severe symptoms but sometimes I just feel down. I believe I had a mild anxiety attack one day while I was lying in bed and thinking about something sad and I just started feeling my hearth pumping and I kinda felt like I was shaking from the inside. So its not that my body was shaking but I just felt as thought it was shaking. But generaly I sometimes just feel a bit anxious mostly about my health symptoms. Sometimes I get a mild dizzines. Its really mild, I dont have a feeling like a room is spinning ir anything like that. I can walk normally, but I just have a feeling as there is something off in my head. Sometimes when I am chilling I just start hearing my hearth pumping. And sometimes I just feel off.

What do you do to calm your general anxiety. Do you take any supplements, eat any specific foods etc? Just breathing dosnt really calm me as its not that I have a panic attack, but I just feel a but anxious."
Anxiety,I'm so f*cked its not even funny.,"So, i'm 25, pretty damn lonely growing up. because i'm quiet, anxious all the time, no social skills whatsoever, got some mental health issues, anxiety, Aspergers, and god knows what else. And I'm a demisexual. \[gay\]

I thought I wanted to experience a relationship, and challenge that anxiety for once. But now i'm pretty much in a tipping point scenario where i hooked up with someone on an app. Got to know them a little, their consideration and care for me is unreal and now i'm scared. 

**\[Background\]**

Ive watched relationships, come and go. horrible things. people who love one another and then the other stops loving that person, its one of the worst pains in the world, ive seen so much of it and i never want to be in that position ever. whether i love them and they stop loving me or they love me and i stop loving them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Bottom line\]**

Ive met up with this person. been intimate, like it for what it is. friendships. But they have hinted at a relationship, their feelings, love for me and i don't understand it.  im so insecure. so. unsure. Intimacy is ok but. love, feelings. i wanna avoid that. I dont want to love someone like that. rely on them. fear losing them, fear of the unknown. friendships are great. but never relationships. I just discovered that its a deep-rooted issue within me rather than how things are going. which they are good, my mental health is affected negatively no matter how i go about it. the anxiety is so bad i am literally shaking, its triggering the PTSD parts in me even though nothing negative has taken place, I'm disassociating, splitting....its a flurry of issues which they are aware of to a degree. i miss being a alone. i miss being secure. I miss my protection, theres no amount of acceptance or ""you only live once"" scenario that will convince my deep rooted feelings to change.

and i wonder if im in too deep. i don't want to hurt the person by saying that i don't love them. because there are sparks of feelings there which im repressing. I can't allow it, because its so alien to me and it builds up this strange mental reaction and i need more time to look into my   
own feelings to prepare better, they want to go at my pace, go slow, but even slow isnt slow enough....But how? how can i distance myself so that they dont continue to harbor feelings for me. so that i dont hurt them. My past trauma, my past pain and my knowledge of things. I'm uncomfortable. I'm an idiot for making this person care about me for me to just....bail out. I don't know how to tell them. The anxiety is a wildfire."
Anxiety,I don't know whats going on with my mind (also don't know a better title),"Hello,

I've recently started to paying attention to some stuff from my mind and I think i might need some help. I am 27 now, and i spend my free time playing competitive games and often became good at it (because I do study/research/training a lot of course, i'm a slow learner). But the problem is, every time i start to became good and get some tournament results, I can't play anymore cause my anxiety level and pressure thinking ""I need to win this otherwise people will think i'm shit"" is too high, my heart start beating like crazy and i really get a feeling that i'm being sufocated. And due to it, after it happened like in three or four different games i decided to think more about it because competitive games is my only hobby and I met a lot of wonderful people on this communities, but I can't even play with them because I feel that people (as I won some tournaments etc) will think that I need to be good, and when I'm not I don't know how they will feel or think about it. 

Thinking about the past, when I was a teenager I really wanted to learn soccer, but as I always playing with people that are good, I always don't wanna to receive the ball, cause the high pressure situation where everybody will look at me and i will probably fail to receive the ball properly made me feel at that time as the same I feel now on competitive games (after a while), so I always hide behind someone or tried to avoid receiving the ball being in bad spots on the court so nobody would pass to me, eventually i gave up and never learned to play soccer again because now i'm too old and people at my age should already be able to play at least better than a kid.

 Rewinding a little more, when I was like 8 i was at a swimming school or whatever its called, and won some gold medals (despite being very afraid of competitions cause it was my first time), there's one day that I was with flu (is this right? i'm not native english speaker lol) and couldn't swim properly/fast, so I lose and i remember my parentes were really sad, and i felt really shit about it, so maybe it all started that day? I mean, it's already like 20 years ago and i still remember exactly how my parents looked when i finished and asked if i had won, they were very sad and maybe angry, didn't even reply they just turn around and walked away. So, if anyone know what can i do to solve it and not be afraid to do the one thing i may be good at and really like? sry if the text was too long or bad, i hope it make sense haha"
Anxiety,"Advice on life situation (anxiety, relationships, careers)","This is going to be a complex one haha. I’ve always had depression on and off especially as I have quite chronic ocd (termed magical thinking ocd) since I was a child, but the last two years it been very bad. Lately I have been partying a lot more spending a lot of money and taking drugs everytime I’ve been out. Maybe a mix of just wanting to let go and be wild and pure anxiety. The day after I always wish I could go back in time to when I was younger before any of the complexities of life (no relationships, struggles with body image, ego, social media) my work has suffered because of this (lack of motivation) and regularly I feel it’s a huge chore even washing my hair. I was in a relationship for years which started when I felt better about myself and life, there was many times it wasn’t great at all and we had issues but for the most part it was comfortable and familiar. A big issue in relationships for me have been sex, I struggle to get aroused easily and avoid being touched down there for the embarrassment of being dry, (by the way I’m not lesbian I would just embrace that if I was I have experienced sexual attraction towards men) - but my body doesn’t respond. I seem to have only felt sexual excitement when I feel I’m being mistreated or unwanted. For example, the only time I can name that I felt a lot of sexual desire was in my teens, when a guy I liked wasn’t as interested in me as I was in him, he had other girlfriends, still flirted with me and sometimes randomly kissed me and I would live for this moments. Apart from that time in my life, I haven’t experienced much sexual desire and felt the need to masturbate about anyone / any situation. So because of this, I would get drunk in order to sleep with people I was going out with. 1 to kill the nerves, and 2 to try and arouse myself more with intoxication. I also feel the need to give men sexual attention soon on dates otherwise I feel it’s awkward, where as many of my friends just have dinner, a chat and leave. It’s not that I want to do so, I feel I need to to avoid awkwardness. 

Another thing I struggle with that I want to put out there (incase anyone sees a connection possibly) is I regularly have identify crisis’. I am a part of the stem community, I’ve always studied stem and enjoy it, but there’s also a part of me that’s very creative, I want to write and am very connected to art, this has blossomed even more since getting older (in my twenties) and now I feel in two halves, I don’t feel as connected and passionate about the stem world and wish I could go back and do something in writing, and English literature. But it’s far too late and I don’t have any funding either. So I feel there’s there’s a tug of war between these two sides of myself, and I’m struggling more and more to enjoy studying what I am (in stem) 

I could write more and more but this is a summery, I was wondering if I could get some insight on this by anyone who has any experience or perhaps someone studying psychology or works in that field. As it’s very hard to get help these days

Thank you"
Anxiety,Quitting buspirone - experiences?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been on buspirone for a month and a half, 3x10mg per day. Recently I’ve been having the sensation of vibrations throughout my body and I’m not sure if it could be the buspirone. It’s a more recent thing so I think it could be it. It could be some weird new manifestation of anxiety but the sensation itself gives me a lot of anxiety. I’m also taking seroquel 25mg most nights, and it’s worse on days when I didn’t take the seroquel the night before. Also pregabalin 3x150mg daily but I’ve been on that one for much longer so I doubt it’s that. I’m also slowly tapering off Valium but I’m at 1.5mg daily which my doctor says is doing nothing at this point. On top of that I have a history of alcohol abuse so I’m pretty worried I’ve just permanently messed myself up, I have a lot of health anxiety.

All the jobs I can do right now require real life contact with customers which is already anxious enough for me but the bigger problem is me giving back wrong amount of money since my math isn't that great. I know this sounds dumb but which anxiety isn't dumb.

Anxiety,Anxious that i might be schizophrenic or on the autism spectrum,"Im starting to get worried im schizophrenic or something... 
I do have OCD &amp; pure-O (have had all my life) so i have anxiety themes from time to time but this feels truly scary...

As a small child my parents did say i was kindof distant but during my childhood and teens i was pretty ""normal"", had a lot of friends and managed well, i became quite and emotional kid. Its only now in my 30s i kind of feel more like that small boy i used to me. Inside my own head, minding my own business and loving that.

Example of the things i think and worry about too: 

 - I feel im lacking emotions / cannot trust human emotion more as just signals and chemicals and not something intrinsically real or useful to have.
 - I also i function well socially, I have friends and like socializing at times but also feel indifferent about socialising as a necessity. 
 - I cannot trust people either as intrinsically good or that human emotion is real, deep down we are just acting out of human ego and our own needs, love is an illusion. Am i supposed to have friends or kids? Whats the use?
 - I enjoy being alone most of the time because i can only trust myself and my emotions but I'm very aware about them too so i dont get caught up in them.
 - Many things people view as a ""normal"" part of human necessity i feel are objectively absurd when i dissect them. Especially things about emotions, needs. I dont push away emotion, i just observe them and let them be. 

These are the things i feel are a sign im totally insane ... ive considered being mildly on the autism / asperger spectrum... then again im not sensitive to sensory input and can feel quite much empathy, im just insanely objective about things... this freaks me out at times.
Im going insane right?"
Anxiety,Should I start Lexapro/Cipralex for Health Anxiety?,"Hello everyone! I try to summarize my experience.

I have been suffering from health anxiety for over a year and I practically feel that it has completely shut me down: I am not able to get out of this vicious circle: anxiety causes me physical symptoms, physical symptoms cause me fear that i may have a fatal disease and this fear causes me anxiety. 

I had another extremely similar episode in 2015, when everything was solved after I managed to have a healthy relationship and also find a well paying job. My question now is: should I wait and hope that this process will end naturally or should I accept my doctor's advice and begin taking Cipralex/ Lexapro? My current biggest fear is that I will have to take it for a long time, which I am not comfortable with at all. I just don’t like pills of any type.

Anxiety,Lady who asked for my help on a few jobs on my days off isn't contacting me back to confirm times to start work.,"I (f33) have a full time job and need extra money. I have an elder friend who cleans houses and says she can use the extra hands if I'm available this Monday, Tuesday and Friday. 

I have been budgeting and money is tight and the money I was going to get for these houses were going to go towards gas and an oil change. Last Friday I told her ""Just tell me the times and I'll be there"". Her reply was ""will do"".


All weekend I've not heard from her and my boyfriend said to me if she hasn't told you what time to meet then she doesn't need your help. I'm autistic and some things slip past me so I asked him to confirm that's what this radio silence on her end really was. 


Just to be sure, I messaged her this morning saying,"" because I've not gotten any time confirmation that means there's no houses, correct?""

Still radio silence. 

I'm next to paralyzed waiting on SOMETHING! Disappointed and worried now about how I'm going to get that extra $200 this week from those houses. 


I ran my own cleaning business years ago and I ALWAYS communicated with my team and houses. Idk why that's not happening with my friend now. A simple text is all! In 72 hours, a simple ""8 a.m. or no houses"". 5 seconds to text and nothing. 


I'm trying not to downplay my anxiety and feel it so I don't have an attack, but it's difficult for me to not suppress this because it's my ""go-to"" method of coping. 


Just one simple text. Why is that difficult?! And it's rude and dismissive of MY time on my day off. I just...UUUGH!"

Anxiety,Struggling With “Permanent” Decisions / Commitments,"I have daily anxiety, but what usually sends me into a sickly-anxiety state are “permanent” decisions or things that feel like a commitment. I’m the type of person who wants to thoroughly understand all available options before I choose something, but as we know, life is not like that. 

For example, years ago I left one relationship to be in another (with my now husband), and I threw up every day for over a year because of the anxiety of making that choice, even after it was done. Planning my wedding was full of choices that sent me spiraling. Did I impulsively choose my venue? Is it too expensive? Did I see enough places before I chose it? Is this really the dress that is the absolute best dress for me, that I’ll remember for the rest of my life? I loved it in the store, but it was the first dress I loved - should I have tried on more? I can’t even hang pictures on the walls with nails, because I don’t want to regret the hole in the wall if I decide tomorrow that I don’t like the placement. I use command strips for everything. 

I don’t remember it always being this way - this is probably something that started for me after college, when I realized the rest of my life was not already planned for me like my entire school experience had loosely been. 

Anyway, my husband and I are shopping for a home, and I’m afraid this experience is going to send me into meltdown. We got really excited about a house and made an offer last week (it wasn’t accepted, this market is a bloodbath), and immediately after the offer was submitted, all of the excitement washed away and became something like regret and fear - like I almost hoped they didn’t accept because then the next 30 years have just been decided for me. We are submitting 2 more offers today, and I’ve been excited about both options, but if both are accepted the choice between the two houses is going to destroy me. I’m worried I will regret not choosing whichever house doesn’t get chosen. 

Any advice on how to deal with this?

TL;DR - Big, “irreversible” decisions send me into panic. Now I’m home shopping and need to choose a house, and am worried I won’t be satisfied with any choice I make."

Anxiety,Me worrying about other people is making my anxiety the worst it's been in years.,"This all started back in February when my younger brother, who lives in a nearby town, was faced with a huge repair bill so he has been forced to not use his car for the time being. Thankfully he has a job in the same town that he lives as a line cook that he has been working at for several years now. I started getting much more anxious when I began having thoughts that since he no longer has his car and is still working as a line cook, he would take his own life and the rest of the family wouldn't know until much later.

To try and ease my anxiety and to help him out, I gave him my bike to help ease his commute and have been checking in on him twice since then to see how he's doing. The thing that keeps worrying me is that he only sporadically responds to my texts, if at all, when other people in my family and co-workers typically respond within a few hours or the same day. My anxiety has been fuelled by the worry that this behaviour is indicative of my brother either hating our family or isolating himself from us prior to him taking his own life.

I try to counter these negative thoughts with more positive ones, along with the knowledge that he has told me that he's doing just fine on several occasions in person and over text since his car troubles began. But the anxious feelings still remain despite these reassurances and they're now impacting my sleep and ability to enjoy life in general.

I just wish I could adopt a more positive outlook on life as well as not be alone with my own thoughts all the time. The only person I talk to for any period of time is my mom, who has been a great support for me but I don't want to constantly drag her down with my problems. Why can't I just be more positive like everyone around me is? :-("

I’ve had anxiety since I was little (my father suddenly died) and soon after developed some pretty bad OCD. I’ve been on the same medicine since I was 15, probably time for a change but that makes me nervous. I have a lot going on lately.. my schedule has changed, I’m moving into my first apartment and I’m getting married next year. I have really bad health anxiety, I always obsess over something health related and I can usually label it as my anxiety. The past week I’ve just felt “off” but can’t describe it. Some of it is health related but I just feel strange? I’m sorry that’s vague. The past two nights have had very vivid dreams as soon as I fall asleep that wake me up and I instantly feel like I’m dying or I don’t feel real. I’m getting scared that there’s something MORE wrong with me either physically or mentally, I’m at a loss I guess. Just needed to vent/know if anyone has felt similar. 

Thank you."
Anxiety,Social anxiety or shyness?," 

Since im surrounded by friends and I avoid social situations there isn't that many problems. But when the problem arises , It's really tough. I absolutely hate being in the spotlight, I get so anxious. Just earlier today we were playing rounders at school. I got so nervous when it was my time to hit the bat that my heart started beating really loudly despite the fact that I had only walked a couple of meters, I got a stomache-ache and my hands started trembling. I kept telling myself that there was nothing to worry about but it didn't help. When I couldn't hit the ball I just started laughing akwardly, I didn't want to show the fact that I was embarrassed. My hands didn't stop trembling for like an hour. I'm always like that, I always try to hide the fact that I'm a wimp. When I'm embarrassed I either laugh akwardly trying to make a joke out of the sitation or I put on my resting-bitch-face pretending I don't care. My worrying really only surfaces when I'm in the spotlight or when I'm alone. But I'm never really alone I always stick to my twin-sister. It hasn't always been like this, I belive it started around two years ago.

Can you have social anxiety even though it's only sometimes or is this just extreme shyness?"

Anxiety,“Rude awakening” to social anxiety,"
for reference I an merely 15. 

I have experienced panic attacks and passing out from different anxieties, social always being worst. 

I recently (around a few months ago) opened up to a friend I barely know about it because im moving and I dont want to end up like before, and they said that “self-acceptance” is the most important. When I seek myself for context, I always assume I can do so in the worst moments. How I like to deal with it is long 2-3 hour walks around 15 km and so I do them a few times a day. 

I wanted to go for one this evening when my mum said something that made me realise, she said “It looks to other people like you are mentally insane”. I thought about that. I realised my dad had always been telling me “Men cant talk like that, cant dress like that,” and similar things like that. I honestly dont know what to do because they panic and turn all against me whenever I confront, and I am livid about this, they probably are not even aware of the insecurities theyve planted but that does not change that they did plant them. I realised that my parents taught me to be highly judgmental, particularly towards myself."

Anxiety,"help, is this a panic attack?","So something very weird happen today at school. School has always made me nervous, everyday I wake up knowing that no matter what I WILL feel nervous during the first two classes. But I always had it under control, managing to stay clam for the rest of the day till I get home.
But today I couldn't; I started to feel stomach pain, my vision gets dark around the edges and I can only focus on my notebook, people speak to me but I can't figure out what they are saying, I can't concentrate in the class and my head feels heavy and I start to sweat like crazy. I always feel this way during the first class, every day that I am at school is the same but today I couldn't bare it and as soon as we had our first break I asked my mom to come pick me up. I waited for her at the school's nursery and when the nurse asked me what was wrong I felt guilty and stupid and I started crying (which is super rare cuz I'm very good at holding back tears).

Like I said; I have always felt this way during the first hours at my school and I was always able to keep it under control but today it was too much and I only wanted to get out of school as soon as possible. I told my mom for the first time what was happening and she suggested that I may had have a panic attack but I'm not sure. I'm very confused, I don't want to go back to school ever again."
Anxiety,"Speech/vocabulary getting worse, afraid it's schizophrenia","So I have anxiety, OCD, and a little bit of DPDR, and lately I've been concerned that I'm in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. One particular thing that's been making me anxious is the fact that my speech and vocabulary seem to be getting worse, and it's been sort of difficult to make fully comprehensible sentences. Even as I write this, I'm struggling. It just feels like the words aren't there. I've also been struggling a little bit with spelling, and I keep accidentally mixing up homophones like write and right. I keep losing my place and overall language just feels difficult right now.

For example, I was just on the phone with my mom, and said something to the effect of ""I just got a call from the place that prescribe meeting tomorrow"". What I meant to say is that I just got a call from the prescriber that I have a meeting with tomorrow, I just felt like I couldn't form it a the way into a coherent sentence in the moment. This made me sort of panic as soon I said it because I know it's this sort of jumbled up word salad that is a big indicator of schizophrenia.

Reading has also been difficult, I find it hard to keep my place and I keep mistaking words for other words.

So yeah, this is definitely making me really anxious. I know that anxiety can definitely effect people's speech, but this happens even when I'm not anxious and it's been getting a lot worse lately."

Anxiety,Made a chunky breathrough,"I understand how this piecenof advice might not be applied to everone and how believing in such a scenario might be foolish from my part, but as someone who has bwwn facing anxiety to different degrees as of recently (if you see my post from the weekend, you can see one of those... points) but I always felt like anxiety was something I had to defeat.

I would spend night and day thinking off possible psychological route, believing that if I did X or believed in Y then it would dissapear in an instant. And it was wrong. I think that the reason on why anxiety fucked with me and possibly you for a long time is because it goes against our whole ideology of gotta fix this inmediatly or let it haunt us forever if we are unable to do so. And even if it hurt me in the beginning, letting the doubts that I have roam freely across my mind, they did reduce my total stress level by a goof chunk.

Also in my case I am really sensible about the functionality of my brain because I consider that my identity depends on my conditions of genius, and even if it true or not it doesnt matter but that is probably what others know about me in my friend group. So for the longest time I would pass possible breakthroughs as impossible because my brain was dreadful that certain electrochemical transition would lead to damage, and I didnt notice until I went searching for it. In the fight against anxiety is like getting out of a mud road so you can fix your vehicle at the garage, it doesnt inmediatly solve everything but it makes it run way smoother.

Just a tip, say ""I will let them roam freely across my mind"" and when your mind probably asks you on how you ate achieving it if you are doing something (wanting to freely roam it across your mind) then repeat it. Hope it works, but no guarantees.

I get shortness of breath where it feels like my lungs can’t take in enough air. As soon as I exhale, I inhale again really quick because it feels like I’m desperate for air. Talking, swallowing or yawning even is hard sometimes. After walking up or down the stairs sometimes too. I’m also struggling to keep my eyes open as I’m writing this as I am so fatigued.

Anxiety,How do I identify what I'm truly anxious about?,"Hi - I'm new here and hope it's okay to ask for some help. I find that I will often get very nervous or anxious about things that I really don't care about. Like, my mental me is chill, but my physical me is all sweaty and vibratey and non-scensical. I figure there's something buried in my mental-me that is actually nervous about something, but I can't figure out what. This issue usually happens when I need to deal with other humans, a work meeting that I have to lead is what led me to write this today. I was a sweaty hot mess (literally, not figuratively) by the end and I had to walk around in circles and load my dishwasher to feel better, and as soon as I'm done writing this, I'm going to use some weed to finish calming down.  


But, here's the thing, there was nothing inherently stressful about the meeting. I was just talking to some co-workers. I don't know why I get so stressed. Everyone is nice, and I'm not taking any risks. I'm not worried about losing my job or offending anyone or doing anything wrong. I was well informed and prepared. I know I'm not really good with words, but even so, in my head, I don't feel that a bit of awkwardness is anything to be anxious about. So why was I physically such a mess?  


Thanks!!! I should add I really know nothing about anxiety, and if it sounds like I'm describing something completely different, and I'm posting in the wrong place, please forgive me."
Anxiety,Any/all help and suggestions requested. Here's my gigantic list of meds/trials over 20 years. Nothing that's actually worked.

It started a few years ago with me learning how to cook dry kidney beans, then progressed to garlic infusions and all things botulism, then green potatoes. and while botulism is the main concern, various animal flus transferring to people (ahem, hello covid. or bird flu) are now on my radar. 

this is really getting to me bc i want to own a homestead (possibly with chickens) but improper canning, brewing and risk of bird flu are really getting to my head! plus it makes it hard for me to enjoy friends cooking when i walk by and see they're preparing green potatoes (!!) or they ""made up their own canning recipe"" 

do y'all know how one can manage? I've found learning really in depth about what's going on with things like botulism help, so i can avoid it in my own cooking, but i just need verifiable resources (and also calming techniques) to calm my mind!"
Anxiety,"""Your anxiety isn't typical""","Hey all, I just got out of a pretty messy psyche appointment and I'm looking for input. 

Today we were discussing whether or not I should be put on anxiety meds. My psyche wasn't impressed with my description of my anxiety, and started citing other examples of patients who fit the typical bill of having heart palpitations and panic attacks all the time.

But, am I crazy for thinking that not everyone with clinical anxiety needs to be shaking and shitting their pants at every hour of the day? I've been struggling with anxiety since childhood and I at least know how to navigate my own illness well enough to keep a roof over my head, because there just isn't another option. I'd be dead otherwise. 

Shakes and panic attacks are debilitating, but so is avoiding everyday scenarios that could put me in that state. So is avoiding work because I don't want to face the anxiety of realizing how behind I am, avoiding imposing on anyone to never have to ask myself if someone secretly hates me, never scheduling doctor's appointments so that I don't have to worry about hearing bad news, even though I'm physically healthy. 

And, most often when I push myself through stressful scenarios, it comes at the cost of any emotional availability. I'm certain I'm not the only person who ""doesn't seem anxious"" because I've mentally ejected from my own life in order to cope. 

**TL;DR, if you feel like sharing, I'd love to hear from people who feel like they don't express 'typical' anxiety; how your anxiety manifests in other ways, and why it's still debilitating.**"
Anxiety,START MEDITATING!!!,"Lie yourself down, start slowly breathing through your nose and relax, trust me it works i can go from being trapped in a horrible state of anxiousness and then i meditate and ill be feeling fucking phenomenal. 

Heres a great video showcasing some breathing excercises you can try: 
https://youtu.be/jrlvGHEJTW0

Add it to your morning routine and nightly routine, combine it with a bit of yoga, it is brilliant, theres no excuse if you can find time to google your symptoms and think erratic thoughts then you can find time for meditation, start with 5 minutes a day then slowly go up to 10 minutes, trust me you will feel the benefits!"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get heart palpitations from anxiety/panic?,This is one of my scariest symptoms aside from my intense DP/DR and am just looking for a little reassurance.
Anxiety,My life is so boring as a teenager. How can I change that?,"I am 14 years old and my life is so monotone. I
don't have friends, I don't hang out, I don't have
much to do except playing basketball 2 times a
week, I mostly stay at home and I don't have
passions anymore. I don't consider my life as
being bad, since I am into self development, I
have good habits and a good lifestyle BUT I
want more. I think the main thing I should do is
making some friends and hanging out to fill up
my time and have fun. The problem is that I
don't know how to find people to try being
friends. At school, I either have nerds or bad
people so this isn't an option. Also, I consider
myself different in a good way and it's hard to
be appreciated by anyone. By the way, I am NOT
an antisocial guy, I have decent society skills
but I just don't have friends and I don't go to
many places so that I can try finding people.
What am I supposed to do? Thanks!"
Anxiety,Does anyone else keep getting sick when they’re under high levels of stress?,"F(20) I took a break from college and came back. This semester I’ve experienced a lot of anxiety and stress because I tend to be an overachiever. The problem is I’ve been getting sick ALOT. I got covid in feb, then a throat infection one week later, an ear infection two weeks later, then a few weeks down the line I’m sick again. It’s always the same symptoms: fever, nausea, dizziness, muscles aches, feeling really weak, tonsils AND my IBS. I get so sick so often lately that I feel embarrassed everytime i send my professors and my boss a sick leave. And when I say sick I mean REALLY sick and on a frequent basis. I also struggle greatly with my memory and I’ve been constantly tired all the time. I am perfectly healthy, no anemia, never had an issue with my immune system until this semester and even prior to covid I kept getting sick so I don’t think it has to do with post covid symptoms. 

I was diagnosed with GAD at a young age around 11 years old and used to have frequent panic attacks. I haven’t had a panic attack in years and usually when my anxiety gets really bad my IBS would just worsen. This really sucks I have no idea what to do I feel like I need to decrease my stress levels and my anxiety so I stop getting so sick all the time but I have no idea how to. This is more of a vent as I currently can’t afford therapy and I would honestly really appreciate some tips on how to deal with a lot of stress when you have anxiety"
Anxiety,Embarrassment,Do you feel embarrassed when people are talking about sex and sexual experiences openly? I had the impression that this is only done out of insecurity and that it is the only thing that person uses to get the attention of others and bypass all that anxiety that is kn the background.
Anxiety,Health anxiety about melted plastic,I have been melting my plastic bottle of honey (store bought) in the microwave for about 10 seconds every day for the past week because the honey has been impossible to get out. It only occurred to me today that this is really stupid to do because what if the plastic is melting too and getting in my system. Will i be okay? I’m freaking out that I’m not gonna be able to digest the plastic
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious watching movies?,"Lately I've noticed whether I'm at the movie theater or at home watching Netflix movies make me really anxious now. I'm not exactly sure why but I think it may have to do with the emotional involvement I have to put into the story? Lots of stories trigger me and movies do just that as of late.  Books don't make me as anxious for some reason. 

Anyone else relate?"
Anxiety,Phantom symptoms and pains with anxiety?,"Hey everyone so i deal with anxiety mostly focused on my health. Whats weird is that i get phantom pains and or symptoms of something after hearing about someone who had a particular health scare. For example my grandmother who is 86 had a heart valve that needed to be fixed and my sister who is 26 has anxiety and gets heart palpitation so she has to wear some device for a month to track that. Once she told me that i started to feel shortness of breath and tightness in the chest i keep checking my apple watch watching my heart rate, doing the ECG on it and checking my oxygen levels. Now im constantly thinking i have a heart issue and getting all these symptoms that i havent heard before until my sister told me what she had to do. Does anyone else get these same type of triggers and if so what helped to calm you and think clearly?"
Anxiety,Anxiety Attack or just losing my mind? I beg for someone's help,"So I have no idea what's been happening to me lately.  I feel like I have a series of panic attacks where I feel like I'm ""stuck"" in time like a time loop. Im just going to talk about my experiences. 

 the other day I was walking through a small tunnel to get to the parking garage when I suddenly started to feel like i have been walking towards the door longer than normal. then i began to panic when i realized that i was basically walking in place. i start to feel heavy in the chest and feeling a sense of being ""stuck in time"". i kept muttering to myself ""this isn't happening, this is not real life"" until i felt like i snapped out of it. 

the following day, i felt myself depersonalizing/ derealizing like i was living in a simulation/ video game. nothing was real. everything was bright and blurry. 

the second incident happened when i was at a concert. I was vibing and then all of sudden i felt like the song kept replaying over and over again. then everyone was looking or glancing at me repeatedly.  I felt like i had to leave and when i tried to climb up the stairs to the lobby the stairs were endless. it felt like i was walking down the stairs for what felt like minutes. i believe i started counting the stairs to ""break the cycle""

the third incident was me walking with my cousin to the parking lot, I felt like the vibes were eerie and overall just off. then she muttered ""i feel like i keep getting stuck"" and all of a sudden it triggered a panic attack, like alarms going off in my head, a heavy painful load on my chest, my vision go blurry. 

I have no idea what this means. I sleep 8-10 hours a day, i exercise pretty regularly, i eat well. i do not consume narcotics. I drink socially (MAYBE once a month). i have been diagnosed with anxiety before but never had i ever suffered from attacks or anything like that. i would just have a million racing thoughts but nothing after that. 

Please Please Please someone help me."
Anxiety,i used to be in love with coffee and drink it every day without problem and all of a sudden i’m having panic attacks every time i drink it :(,has this happened to anyone else
Anxiety,Do fears release through dreams?,"It’s happened to me ab 5 times, usually I think I see a fly or spider on my wall, once I thought I saw a worm in the ceiling. I’ve had a fear of bugs all my life, especially in the dark. Bed bugs, bee hives under my bed, ants under my bed all kinds of stuff. I wouldn’t say I’m bug phobic or something it’s just the anxiety. I also dreamt about bees crawling into my ears, my worst fear. And afterwards I’ve been less afraid of that happening. Less afraid of bees in general. I think since my bug anxiety is getting better as I grow these dreams are a release of the fear rather than a trigger. 

Anybody else?"
Anxiety,Why is it so hard?,"I just cant get used to anxiety meds. Then I sit around and act like if I just ignore my anxiety, itl just go away. Ive had anxiety for 8 years on and off, but when the pandemic started, it became fu blown. I feel like my doctors tell me that anxiety meds is the only option. But I cant get past the side effects.

I felt like I couldnt breathe last night. After finally calming down, I just broke down. I cant keep doing this to myself. I feel like my mind controls me when it wants. I get so paranoid about everything. I worry and overthink. Its so hard when I cant get used to anxiety meds but my anxiety isnt getting better. Im tired of the ER visits and doctors appointments that are pointless. Im tired of my heart always racing because im scared by who knows what. I dont even know my triggers. Im just tired. I just want to live a normal life."
Anxiety,"if only i could cry once i would let go the stress I'm holding within but anxiety made me numb, I'm scared to cry because i might get panic attack from it 😔",But i really need to cry and let all these pain out only for once
Anxiety,Unknown fears,"Hello all! It’s been about 4 days now. All I feel is intense fear and I swear I don’t know why. Never finding someone? Failing at my job? Unrequited love (again)? Never being enough for anyone? Holy hell it is crippling. My heart is pounding in my chest. The only time I feel a bit of solace is when I’m listening to music. Recently, I made up my mind to not body-shame myself for being too skinny/ugly. Thankfully, that isn’t happening (yet). I feel like I’m being stalked by a wolf in a dark forest as I type this. Any tips? Anything?"
Anxiety,"Left hand extremely weak and feeling ""weird""","And a steange feeling of ""weakness"" at the heart.

I am experiencing this since last year. The doctor said this is ""nothing, but anxiety"" but sometimes I couldn't barely grab a pencil.

This usually happens when I wake up.

Can anybody relate to this?

(P.s: I am not a native English speaker)"
Anxiety,Worried about getting arrested,"I know this sounds stupid. Anxiety makes me believe stupid things.

I went to the gas station to get some food today. I grabbed 4 items off the grill. I told the cashier how many items I had, and he charged me. It seemed cheaper than usual, but I didn't think much of it. I thought maybe they had a promotion or something. I left with my food. 

On the way home, I was thinking back on it as I tend to. Then I realized something: the amount I was charged was the price of 3 grill items. I was only charged for 3. So basically I got a grill item without being charged for it. I was already pretty much home so I decided to not drive all the way back. And I also didn't have a receipt, they don't tend to give receipts at the gas station I was at unless you ask.

Now I'm paranoid that I will somehow get in trouble or arrested for this. It looked like a newer chaser, so I'm sure he made a mistake. And I'm pretty sure I told him the right amount. So I don't think it was my fault. But I'm still worried that they will somehow notice a grill item missing and will look at the cameras, and see me taking it. And then maybe they will think I told the cashier the wrong number on purpose to get a free item. I'm so worried about this.

I know it is stupid. But could I get in trouble for this? The grill items are only worth $1.50 but I've heard of people being charged with a felony over 43¢ before. I'm worrying myself over this."
Anxiety,how tf do people live in the moment?,i’m literally stressing about things years away.
Anxiety,I'm terrified of being alone,I'm so worried something bad will happen and I'll have no way of getting help quick enough. I hate being alone because of this.
Anxiety,When your friend gives you reassurance but now I feel like I'm burdening them,"My friend knows that I overthink very easily and so they try their best to comfort me and tell me that it's not true. But now, all I think about is whether or not I am stressing them out and burdening them to the point where they actually do hate me or at least think I'm very annoying. It's just such a stupid spiral and now I want to apologize and cease to exist because now it just seems like I'm high maintenance and clingy. I don't want to be this constantly broken person that they have to fix. I know that I'm overthinking and that my brain is fucking with me but it's so so so hard to tell it to shut up. I don't want to be a burden to them. 

They think I'm getting anxious that they don't respond to my messages quickly and now this goes back to feeling like I'm high maintenance and clingy. I don't want this to become a new precedent where they have to constantly reply to me otherwise ""I'll start feeling anxious."" Like I completely understand that people can't or don't have time to reply, I completely understand. But now my friend has this expectation and I wish I just never told them I was never struggling with anxiety. 

Like they're such a nice person and I really do think they care about me but what if they don't? What if they're starting to get sick of me and my stupidity? I'm not looking for an answer, I just wanted to vent about how much I hate my thought process."
Anxiety,What does this mean?,"My bf said he was going out to a club in New Jersey but I had an uneasy feeling that it might be a strip club. When he FaceTimed me after he got home, he was wearing a blue wristband. Do they usually give you blue wristbands at clubs or is it in strip clubs?"
Anxiety,"Those with OCD, anxiety and depression; how do you deal with intrusive thoughts?",
Anxiety,What drugs can be added to an SSRI for treating anxiety?,"I'm currently on 20mg of Lexapro for anxiety.

My psychiatrist made clear at my last appointment that he won't go higher. But my daily anxiety is still significant (though improved from 15mg, my previous dosage).

I'm not looking for personal medical advice of course (I see him again in about a month), but thought I would see whether others on the sub also didn't get relief at a full SSRI dose and if so what your psychiatrists did? Like... I wouldn't want to take a benzodiazepine, but are there other safer / non-addictive drugs that can be used to ""augment"" response to an SSRI medication?"
Anxiety,I'm scared,"It's like I'm living on a different reality, my vision have been blurry since i developed anxiety and panic disorder which is about for almost 2 year.

There's nothing wrong with my eyes because i know the days where i didn't have anxiety at all and when i was able to get enough sleep my vision used to comeback, but now i can't have that day where i feel normal, i can't feel my body anymore, i can't feel cold also, I'm always on my phone to distract myself so i won't get panic attack, whenever i go to sleep i always wake up with heart palpitations due to anxiety and not being able fall asleep back even tho my mind says i need more sleep

I'm scared because i don't know what to do anymore, I'm scared to meditate and be alone with my own thoughts because my thoughts are very scary , I'm scared that my thoughts gonna put me into psychosis.

Idk what to do

I was prescribed valium (Benzo) which helped me to get rid of this fear and anxiety and actually made me feel a bit normal but i stopped taking it because everyone said it's addicting. I don't know what to do anymore, i considered suicide many times just to escape from this hell , i went to a psychologist for 8 sessions and i didn't get any better, I don't know what to do anymore i don't wanna live with this anxiety anymore"
Anxiety,What are the reasons why we find some people intimidating?,"There are some people that I encounter in my friend’s circle, work or in certain gatherings that I find them intimidating. I feel like I always need to watch what I am saying/doing when I know they will be watching. Is it about self confidence?"
Anxiety,Anxiety when the silence sets in,"My worst anxiety is ALWAYS after an enjoyable social outing or time with people. I’ll get home, ride the high for a bit… and then BAM. The silence settles in and my brain goes into overdrive. Almost every time. And it’s always the worst bouts of anxiety I ever get. 

I started a second job tonight because I desperately need the extra cash. When I read the handbook a few days ago, I was a bit nervous because it said a number of things that were kind of like… indicative of toxic management? But when I did orientation the shift managers seemed great. 

However tonight the person I trained with was honest with me about the amount of drama that can happen, the management styles, etc. And I openly told her &amp; one other person the employee handbook kind of scared me. But I am hoping it’s a good environmental overall &amp; everyone seems cool.  Overall it was a pleasant shift.

All this to say… I’ve been home for 4 hours now &amp; my anxiety is going nuts. What if the managers are awful? What if they expect me to bend over backwards for this part time job? What if they expect me to prioritize it over my career job? What if there’s drama &amp; people shit talk about me? What if the managers don’t like me? What do I do if I end up being unhappy there but really need the extra money? Why did you say that? Was that a bad idea? Maybe I just need to keep my damn mouth shut unless spoken to? 

Ugh. I just want to sleep. And my anxiety just won’t stop."
Anxiety,Unfortunately I'm back - health phobia triggers,"I had a really big breakdown for a few reasons back in January, and it now seems so far away but then I think ""wow that's only 2 months ago. It was a mix of change, grief after losing a distant friend to cancer, and existentialism. I know I was definitely in a more depression related territory, but I existed with anxiety in my abdomen eating at me, without break. Just now I had a small relapse. I know avoidance is a coping mechanism, but I've avoided topics that triggered me and I've actually been almost ""norm"" for the past two months. Went on Reddit again, saw the topic of food, cancer, dementia/Alzheimer's cases rising, and just fucking bawled and choked on my breaths. How do people deal with these topics? Acceptance is missing a couple steps for me, and avoidance surely can't work forever. I'm absolutely horrified and terrified of the idea that cancer can kill a person without them ever knowing or noticing in time. Just typing this is triggering me. Or the fact that there is an unknown percent of chance that my parents can (god forbid) develop dementia or the other one. I want to throw up. I don't want to go back to physical illness from this anxiety."
Anxiety,Fluvoxamine (Side effect question),"Hey, four days ago I got diagnosed with anxiety and I've got to take fluvoxamine (an antidepressant) daily.

The problem is that since I took the first pill, I can barely sleep at night. I don't think it's some sort of side effect because the effect of this medicine comes two weeks after taking it daily, so I guess the side effects too.

Does someone know if it is a side effect? Does it go away if I wait long enough?"
Anxiety,Is this the right way?,"' If what I am worrying is only WHAT IF and is not influencing me right now, I should quit thinking about it'

Should I not worry about things that *might* happen, something that is not effecting me right now and has not happened yet"
Anxiety,Anyone else constantly getting back/neck injuries?,"I constantly am pulling muscles in my neck and back.  Some times from doing simple workout routines like push ups or a jog.  Its so frustrating.  I guess its a combination of really bad posture (people with anxiety tend to have bad posture) and constantly carrying tense muscles ""waiting"" for something to happen.  Physical exercise use to be my escape from anxiety, but now I just keep reinjuring my muscles.  Anyone else suffer from constant strained muscles?"
Anxiety,Anxiety or Dissociating?,"Does anybody ever feel panicky or increasingly anxious when you take a moment to focus on your surroundings? I've struggled with this uncomfortable feeling for years, especially during showers, it's this weird feeling that I can't concentrate enough to ground myself, everything feels very foggy and surreal, and I have to expend a lot of energy just to attempt to ground myself even for a few moments.. 

I'm mostly wondering if anyone can suggest ways to ground my mind and freak out less over the fact I notice how hard it is to be in the present."
Anxiety,Anyone on Xanax here? Do you feel like you like your partner more while on it?,
Anxiety,Finding myself closed off from talking about certain things on the Internet because off repercussions.,"Judgment is extremely commonplace on the Internet. Seeing massive groups of people go after a particular person seems generally accepted. It's genuinely terrifying. Ever since I was little I thought about all of the mistakes I've made in my life. I want to talk about them but stereotypes are rampant and I'm so focused on not being associated with them.

It leads me into destructive thoughts in my head when I'm alone with them at work. It also makes me afraid to put myself out there and accomplish things because I feel like these small mistakes amplify if there's a good reason to call me out on them.

Like maybe I get a nice job one day working with computers and some ex decides that they think it's unfair for me to have it. They could find the worst message I've sent and post it online.

They wouldn't know how I genuinely feel about it and neither would an audience. I delete a lot of my posts and comments because of stuff like this. Theoreticals and what ifs. It's super intense and I don't understand, for example, why people can handle being internet celebrities.

This post alone feels like a risk because by posting it I'm admitting that I have problems and maybe those problems aren't being told because they are really bad."
Anxiety,Hair,"Hello. I’m new to this. But I was wondering if anyone plays with their cowlicks or hair when they’re nervous. That “bump” on hair is a cowlick and idk if I’m the only one. I’ve been doing this for years with trying multiple hair products/ benzo prescription anxiety medications (also associated with ptsd and depression). 

Anyone else dealt with this? It’s my bang cowlicks that are killing me (emotionally and hurt sometimes)

People make fun of me in a joking way, but to me I just want it to end. 

Any ideas?"
Anxiety,does anybody else feel like screaming because of what they are thinking?,
Anxiety,MRI tips?,"I don't have any meds, the appointment is in a few hours, and I'm freaking out.

I've had one years ago but back than I wasn't a nervous piece of nothing lol

What can I do to survive this?
I've been avoiding this for month but it's really quite urgent now."
Anxiety,So unsure about the endgame,"Hi, I'm 23 living in pacnw usa. (Triggers for ptsd, drugs, sui, and overdose reference) I hope this doesn't  break the posting rules for ""seeking where to buy drugs"" as that isn't my goal and I wouldn't pursue it if my therapists thought against it.  
Anyways, I've been running from a lot of childhood trauma, bad mental habits etc for most of my life. For a long time I was just so anxious about making phone calls to set up my healthcare and doctors appointments, and even more anxious to ask anyone to help me. Somehow with this level of internal stress around ppl that I wasn't able to handle 15 minutes on the phone of my own volition, I was able to keep a string of mid-shit tier jobs until these last 3 months.   
I hit a really bad depression after christmas and shortly after I just couldn't see myself walking out the door to go to work again. (I work in food service so my next scheduled shift was basically going to be a packed house on new years eve) My work considers this a mandatory workday and I already knew I would be fired so I simply sent a resignation text and started having a bit of a breakdown on the couch. Following this was the long arduous process applying for and receiving healthcare benefits, seeing doctors etc. Thankfully now I was helped by my partner in the beginning haul and things such as talking on the phone and going out at least for sometime each day have improved for me since starting talk therapy with my counselor. I was diagnosed with GAD and Persistent Depressive Disorder and prescribed medications by my pcp around 2 weeks later. I've also got an intake appointment with a psychiatrist so I can stop going between my dr and my therapist for prescriptions, and I also think more weekly therapy would be helpful.   
So far zoloft has been doing well to keep me out of the depression zone, I am up to 100 mg daily. They've tried 2 different medications for anxiety so far, clonidine, which I started with and am currently taking up to 3 times a day in .01 mg tablets, and briefly hydroxyzine (which gave me great side effects such as making insomnia worse, very blurry vision, etc) The clonidine doesn't do much more at this point than make me drowsy for a few hours (which is sedating) but it quickly loses that effect and seems to require a larger and larger dose to achieve the same level of sedation over time.   
I've been reading into anxiety medications and it seems there are a few more I could try but most of the effects I am looking for are in benzodiazepines. 

This is a touchy idea for me as I've had friends die and almost die from benzo abuse and personally I've only tried half a bar 1 time at a party to try it. It made me rlly sleepy and fall into shit, and I'm sure whatever was in that pill (if it even was benzo tbh :/) was a lot stronger than what my dr would start me on, so I don't rlly have any experience in the therapeutic process with regards to the drug class.  My main issues I'd like addressed is that I don't need acute anxiety relief, as in over the course of 1-2 hours. I rarely have panic attacks since starting therapy and zoloft but the state of dread and general anger/fear at life have only subsided for moments when the sedating effects of my prescriptions were high. I feel I would need a drug that could last around 6 hrs in order to function normally in a work setting. I don't want to become addicted, I know they are not usually for consistent use, I just... can't imagine this pain and fear letting up in the course of a month? Like I'm at the point where I know I need to pay rent and buy food to live, but I would rather die than let some privileged fuck make another dollar off my work. Its so degrading to know your place in society, the lower class, is being treated like shit daily and the only option I have is wait til I can't be supported and go homeless, and probably commit suicide, or sell my fucking freedom to someone who ain't worth a goddamn thing more than me, letting them drain my energy to create things that I love, which will probably make me hate myself so much I kill myself in the end anyways. Its a sick system. I don't know if this is anxiety but I just would rather die.

 It's garbage, hell. I am shit upon every damn day by dudes who are only bein shitty to me every step of the way cause they don't like waiting around in their free time. Cause they got some fuckwad who owns a third of their week too. I'm tired and mentally wounded. The wounds have been untreated by this fuckin society so long that they are infected and I'm gonna have permanent damage if I even get through this shit alive.

The only happy ending I see for myself is becoming a part of some art that truly gives me a way to escape the feeling of this fucking awkward hyper reality bullshit. My dreams and goals aren't centered by anyone, no ones are. Just money money money money money everybody play ur part like a goddamn npc.  
I just feel the end game is me becoming a drone bot of the shit empire maxed out on antidepressants and working my nice guy who can smile and wave and put on a happy face job and surpress my real emotions in the facade of ""social acceptability"" but then getting trapped in the cycle of questioning what is socially acceptable until I pop another benzo. I dont want to work for the shit machine. I would rather die than do it. I don't want to die, but I would rather. 

IDK the way I feel now the only semi hopeful and realistic future for me seems like disability for anxiety and rarely leaving the home for long periods of time, if that is even attainable at my age which I doubt very strongly.   


Pls if anyone relates to what I've said here and has come out the other end help me understand how.

&amp;#x200B;

PS.(The whole ""lower-class"" and hating my boss thing aint there to spark a political debate, I can see how my feelings are written out hyperbolic and explitive ridden but I think it reflects my feelings.  I'm just a bit of a punk in how I talk and thats how I feel abt my standing in the world rn. )"
Anxiety,anyone know what this is????," any solution yet ? I find 4 hours of sleep sometime reduces it , like i'm too tired to even think about thinking, but when I get good sleep, I get energy, and where does it go? like you'd be talking I'd be thinking about thinking about how your mouth moves and that you are talking and that I am thinking and be =ing aware of all this going on in a spiral and then I don't even know what you have been talking about the whole time letting alone reading a book , it would be much easier! irony , is this ocd or anxiety? been on ssri, bipolar meds, nothing, onnly thing helped a little was ritalin, like adderall, but the thought is still present in me thus even when happy, I get the idea and suddenly everything turns bland and strips the joy from me just by realizing that again I am aware of being aware f being aware, !!! how do I go through life with this ? who the f would tolerat me?? do you even know how many times I got fired ? how many years I lost in school by failing while studying like hell?,, IT TAKES ME 50 TIMES MORE WHAT IT TAKES A NORMAL PERSON TO READ A SINGLE PAGE ! this is just one of the reasons if you gave me a billion dollars I would never even consider have a baby, and all this is causing me more depression and anxiety ! I'm thinking this is ocd since it feels like I'm doing it impulsively and on purpose, like I don't want it but the fact that I don't want it and being aware of it and pushing it away makes me have the ideas more and more, I know you might say well then just accept it, easy to say, I wish I could !

Anxiety,Buzzing/vibrating legs,"Does anybody feel as if her/his body were buzzing every time?? I have every time this sensation and it is pretty annoying, especially in my legs.
I feel it when I am resting and I do not feel anything while walking
This started after a period of big stress due to contracting mononucleosis. I had various panic attacks and then I developed this.
I have overcome mono and has had some blood work done as well as MRI and EMG with good results.
I though this could be fasciculations but whenever I see my body it is completely still.
Doctors say it could be anxiety but it is very difficult for me to trust it
Some reassurance is welcome"
Anxiety,Health Anxiety and Lexapro?,"Hi guys, I've been struggling with severe anxiety for years now. I had a nice stint where I barely got anxious. Maybe once every few months but the last 2 years have been horrendous. I cannot convince myself that I am not dying from some underlying health issue. I've spent thousands on getting heart stress tests, MRIs, X-Rays, blood tests you name it I've had the test done. 

&amp;#x200B;

I usually feel great after the test result comes back but then a new feeling in my body pops up and I'm convinced it's something deadly. It's really affecting my day-to-day life and I'm struggling to even get through a single day without a panic attack that lasts for hours. My only coping mechanism is playing computer to not think about anything and hyper-focus on the game.

I've seen a tonne of posts advising that Lexapro really helped them and I guess I'm just looking for that final confirmation that I should try it. I'm scared of medication and side effects. Has anyone had any negative side effects? I use to take Effexor I think it was called and I'd get horrible brain zaps and feel nauseous and extremely sick when I missed a single tablet.

I'm new to this thread so please be kind. I just really need help."

Anxiety,Tell me I’m not alone.,"I am a veteran. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder like 5 years ago.  

I know anxiety is different for everyone. I know some may just worry a lot etc. 

I have a multitude of physical symptoms that present themselves randomly throughout the day and I just want to make sure it’s not just me and I’m not crazy or dying.  

I randomly will get a bad spinning effect if I’m watching a movie or screen that moves quickly.  Walking sometimes feels difficult, when my anxiety is high I shuffle my feet almost as I’m scared of falling. Sometimes I just feel like I’m about to fall over. My spatial awareness gets fucked sometimes.  Is this just me? Does anyone else experience this?  I’ve been evaluated by PT and OT and they said I’m good.  This never happened until I had my first panic attack years ago.  

Any insight would be appreciated.  Thank you for reading.

Anxiety,About worrying," 

I'm not sure if I have an anxiety disorder but I post in here because I am anxious.

My fear right now is that my game account might being banned in the future because of something wrong I did 1 year ago. Because I worry I can't enjoy the game.

So I made a logical thinking about worrying

If what I am worrying is only WHAT IF and is not influencing me right now, I should quit thinking about it

For example, my account being banned is only a what if scenario in my head, and it didn't happen yet and may never happen. And if it does become banned I could still appeal for second chance. There are many cases that they gave second chance

So for my account to be completely banned both should be true 1. It does get banned and 2. I fail to get a second chance from the moderators both are not true right now so I should stop worrying the shit out of it

The key point: If what you are worrying is only WHAT IF and is not influencing me right now, I should quit thinking about it

Is thinking like this logical and good?"
Anxiety,Valdoxan - 6 days in,"I was going to do this from day one, but hey i got busy with life.  History - Anxiety leading to depression for most of my adult life.  This is episode 6.  First 2 I did without medication. Next  2 with Prozac and number 5 with Lexapro.  Both very effective SSRIs but wow are those first 6 weeks hell or what!

Last couple of months I could feel the anxiety building.  Used the toolkit, mindfulness, CBT, exercise, meditation.  All very useful as part of my daily dealing with anxiety.  But it was incrementally getting worse.  Like a rising tide, small waves, then a surge.  GP said, with your history, it would be wise to go back on AD.  Sigh.  Really?  6 weeks of hell?  Well you could try Valdoxan.  Not an SSRI.

As insomnia is the thing that brings me down when anxiety strikes it seemed a logical thing to try.  Oh, but it is expensive…ummm who cares… costs about half a cup of coffee a day.  Twice my Netflix bill a month.  In the scheme if things if it works I would pay triple.  So here we are day 6 and …..why had nobody told me about this before!!!  First 4 nights “odd sleep”.  Can’t really describe it, but hey 7 hours from the first night of taking it  and not drowsy next morning. Side effects -  I rarely get headaches but I could feel them coming on.  Never got one though.  For headache prone people might be a problem.  By day 4 anxiety all but gone.  Ok, it is still early days, but on an SSRI I would be an anxious wreck at this stage, praying for the weeks to rush by.  Maybe it is placebo effect, maybe the side effects are just around the corner.  But for now 10/10.   Hoping no weight gain or liver problems.  mmmm is that my catastrophising saying hello? 😀"
Anxiety,"Anxious about dental problem, catastrophizing that my health might get worse. Talked to partner about it, he told me I should stop thinking about the future and focus on what solutions I could do. He means well but I feel he's tired hearing about me panicking over things.","I had wisdom tooth pain weeks ago. Pain was intense three weeks ago. I had an anxiety attack thinking about the pain, the impact on my work performance because of the lack of sleep, the cost of the procedure, and the problem with seeking a schedule with the specialist. Weeks and days after, I eventually found solutions to these problems and was able to find a good dentist who would take my case (the consult would be on Monday)

I haven't experienced pain for more than a week but the gum is inflamed around that area. I noticed what might be an abscess around the other side of the gum.  Talked to my partner about it. I'm worried the infection might have spread. I read about the possibility of it spreading to the tooth or bloodstream, or the possibility of a more costly procedure. I know I tend to catastrophize but I'm the sole earner of my family and any threat to my health, I think about them.  I told him how I feel worried and he said I should stop worrying myself and start thinking of solutions.  But I also felt he was mad. I asked him and he told me he was annoyed, cause I always drive myself to think like this. I know he means well. It's just difficult for me to think straight when all this weight and responsibility is thrust upon me and any little thing that might impact that, worries me a lot.

Anxiety,Slowly building my social skills back but by bit,"18M UK

Bit of backstory: I’ve been dealing with social anxiety my whole life and it got drastically worse at the age of 14-15, I’d been smoking weed since I was 14 to “help” my anxiety and depression but it was just masking the problem and I was slowly turning into a recluse By 17 I quit weed involuntary (started giving me panic attacks for no reason) and was basically a complete recluse and then my health anxiety started and it was constant everyday physical symptoms now at 18 I’ve just been diagnosed with a rare genetic heart disorder (great am I right?) this is a blessing and a curse on one hand I’m very worried about my heart but it has also freed me in some weird way I can’t explain like I suddenly got an answer after years. 

Anyway this heart condition is making me want to start living again so I’m starting small (going to the shops, meeting friends 1 on 1, going on little walks) and hopefully as exposure therapy builds up I’ll be able to start living the life I had before (drinking, going to parties, hanging out with friends) I’ve already noticed that I feel more comfortable going out of the house so I think the trick with me at least is to crawl before you can walk, walk before you can run. 

Anyway if you read all this thanks just wanted to share my experiences and how I’m coping with them"
Anxiety,"Battling extreme brain fog for entirety of high school, unrefreshing sleep, as well as extreme anxiety. Please help!!"," Throughout my life, I have always suffered with anxiety and being ""slow"" in certain social situations.

In addition, I have a history of childhood ear infections, and the last one in early 7th grade made me permanently deaf in my left ear.

However, life was decent enough for me until the latter portion of 8th grade, and that is when the real trouble started.

It began slowly, but over the first year of high school, I noticed that I would be extremely tired, and unable to get out of bed as before, even after sleeping for 8-9 hours.

Basically, never feeling refreshed after a ""good"" night of sleep.

I would get music looping in my head, driving me crazy. These were popular songs which I enjoyed.

Over the period of this year, a severe brain fog began to develop, and I began to struggle in classes.

I couldn't do simple homework assignments in areas which I had previously excelled in, it was just too taxing for my brain.

My anxiety skyrocketed to levels never seen before, talking to even my friends became impossible, my face would turn beet red when called on in class, even in subjects which I enjoyed.

My gaze and awareness were also affected, I would not be able to look normally at peoples faces as I was able to before. My eyes would abnormally fixate on their eyes, and I could see how weird it made them feel, they would avoid eye contact with me.

I guess this would be considered ""hyperawareness.""

In addition, I felt very depersonalized, like a shell.

Also, after orgasm, I felt even more fatigued then usual, and the brain fog and anxiety, already horrible, became worse.

I should have told my parents right then, but I didn't, and my struggles continued throughout all of high school.

I stayed home and took online classes my first year of college, as my parents did not trust me to succeed alone at college.

Here, I was able to sleep in for the first time in my life.

During this year, I was getting around 10 -12 hours of sleep everyday.

Slowly, the brain fog began to fade, as did the post-orgasm symptoms, and the anxiety began to lessen, as did the looping music, and my grades became straight A's, as opposed to the C's in high school.

The next year, (2019), I went to live on my own in college, and took in person early morning classes.

This resulted in my averaging about 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and behold, the symptoms all came back. My grades dipped, and I am at home as I type this.

Additionally, over the past year, I have developed a blinking tic, and when I become tired, my left eye will shrink.

I also seem to have a gluten sensitivity- my stomach becomes very bloated and anxiety seems to get a bit worse.

I have gotten some blood tests done, seem to be normal, however, my liver is damaged, judging by the high level of liver enzymes.

I eat extremely heathy, minimal sugar/junk.

My sleep seems to be normal to my knowledge, I am very skinny, and lightly snore, so don't meet the sleep apnea stereotype. I have also used an o2 smartwatch, which did not show any significant o2 desaturation.

Uars maybe? But even that doesn't explain the severity of the symptoms.

This is all so weird, and I have not found anyone on the net with these kinds of symptoms or their level of extremity. Why does sleeping 11+ hours drastically reduce the severity of my symptoms?

I know it is not all in my head. 

For the past 6 - 7 years in particular, I have lost out on my life, and no idea what it is to live a normal life.

Can someone please give me some ideas or steer me in the right direction??

Any help would really be appreciated.

Thank you all so much."

Anxiety,How to deal with pre-trip anxiety?,"Hi everyone. I wanted to pose this question in here to see if anyone else deals with this and how exactly you deal with it. 

The title kind of sums it up, but for more context I have traveled quite a bit in my life. And the funny thing is I love traveling, but my mind tries fo convince me otherwise, sometimes successfully. Every time I have a trip coming up, I can feel the anxiety start to come around about a week before I leave. And then sometimes gets more severe in the last couple days before I go. And what makes me anxious is thinking about things going wrong, I’ve always had some fear of a medical emergency even though I’m a healthy 24 year old, and how I would get to the hospital, etc.. also the thought of going to sleep and waking up in a foreign place throws me off. 

But the other thing is probably 80% of that anxiety goes away as soon as the plane leaves the ground. And there have been very few trips ever that have actually gone ‘bad’. I usually have a great time. It’s all in the build up.

Part of the reason I’m writing this now is I’m actually leaving for a trip tomorrow. I’ve not been very focused all week at work, and this morning I actually threw up. The anxiety in the buildup makes me not even want to go, even though I’ve been looking forward to going on this trip for a while. 

Any tips on dealing with pre-trip anxiety?"

Anxiety,Why Anxiety and Depression are closely connected in many ways," 

## Depression and obesity often come hand in hand

&amp;#x200B;

Depression is a disorder that does not get nearly enough attention. Depressed people are often told to ""cheer up"" or to ""look at the bright side"" of things, and may spiral even deeper when they are unable to simply snap out of the mood that has such a hold on them. While depression can often lead to fatigue and listlessness, it has a close cousin by the name of anxiety. Anxiety causes the opposite effect, putting our bodies into the ""fight or flight"" mode that protected us in the wild. 

 Anxiety attacks can feel like heart attacks, and even at more moderate levels, anxiety can have a dangerous and very negative effect on our lives and on our quality of living. Anxiety can also lead to depression when a sense of worry and fear for the future leads to a sense of helplessness and hopelessness.   
That is a classic symptom of depression. Depression and anxiety are often seen together, and can sometimes lead to one another.   


### Anxiety feelings 

Anxiety is a way of describing a certain way of feeling. It may represent a sense of fear, dread, or a sense that you are in immediate danger, even when you are safe and have no reason to feel this way.   
There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including phobias or irrational fears, situational anxiety, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders among others.   
These disorders can lead to a state of almost constant high stress and can affect your daily life much to the worse. You may be unable to function in certain situations, or you may come to fear leaving your own home, and if untreated, the symptoms of anxiety disorders can lead to many of the same problems as depression, including insomnia or a reluctance or fear to leave the house or to be around other people.   


### Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression

Anxiety symptoms can also feel like heart attacks, with palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pains, and more. You might begin trembling and shaking, your mouth might go dry, and you might become dizzy from the stress of the situation.   
The body becomes ""hyped up"" by your reaction to the situation, and your senses go into a sort of overdrive that is unlike the depression of the system that happens when you suffer from clinical depression.   
Depression disorder actually slows the body in some ways, making you feel sluggish rather than ready to run or fight, and hopeless rather than actively panicked or fearful. If you have been suffering from anxiety attacks, the attacks themselves may lead to depression because of the hopelessness that you feel at the hands of the attacks and because of the fears that are associated with possibly having another attack.   
If your anxiety symptoms have changed to include listlessness, disinterest in things that used to engage you, or feelings of hopelessness and self-loathing, then you may now be suffering from a depression disorder and should be treated accordingly for your medical condition.   
Depression is not a constant state of being, nor is anxiety. You might think that because you have a good number of ""good days"" your depressive days are just bad moments that will pass, however, depression can become worse over time if it is not treated and taken care of, and can lead to suicide if left untreated long enough.   


### Anxiety disorders and obesity

The connection between body weight and mental disorders remains an open issue. Low body weight has been studied enough (anorexia nervosa is a typical example) but high body weight has not been addressed sufficiently. It is known that obesity has been related to depression."
Anxiety,Getting tired of living life like this,"I am so lost at the moment. I am a 21 year old male and have been experiencing major anxiety and panic since being diagnosed with costochondritis.

I’ve never taken medicine and never been a very anxious person. After a really bad flare up of costo I started getting overly anxious and aware of random sensations in my body. The following week I started getting brain zaps and a really scary tingly feeling all over my scalp.

I went to my PCD and she was extremely concerned. Not only about my anxiety but apparently I had extremely high blood pressure! This scared me to death as they informed me I was in “the danger zone.” I went home, bought a blood pressure cough, and my anxiety was PEAKED. It read 200/115 and I convinced myself I was going to die! After getting through that spell i started my medication of Lisinopril, Buspirone, and Zoloft. Like i said, i’ve never taken medications so i think my body had a really bad reaction.

I couldn’t sleep, my chest was constantly hurting, and I felt like I couldn’t function! She told me to only focus on my high blood pressure and since then I have still felt absolutely awful. I work a strenuous job and by the end of my shift I feel like I could collapse. LITERALLY!!! My head gets super fuzzy and I get very dizzy!! Not spinning dizzy but like my body is just going to fall to the floor and my eyes feel like they’re vibrating. I’ve had tension headaches non stop for 3 weeks now.. and i keep getting stabbing sensations all over my left side of chest- sometimes radiating to the right. I notice that my medicine seems to make activate these sensations but I just don’t know anymore. 

I went to the ER last monday and got all the tests run through. I even went back to my PCD and got additional blood work done. They put me on Metoprolol to slow my heart and work to decrease my blood pressure further. Im still experiencing the stabbing pains and they freak me out… I can’t help but think it’s something worse and Im so over this. 

(I also experienced a burning ache under my breast bone that’ll last a few hours or sometimes wake me up in the middle of the night. this was about 2 weeks ago) so i started thinking it was angina but i could’ve sworn that’s what my doctor said she was testing for in my blood. WHY AM I FEELING THIS!!! the dizziness and headaches are unbearable everyday. Feels like my head is waiting to explode and at the peak tension is when i feel like im gonna fall to the floor."
Anxiety,Is it okay to let my anxiety win at something?,"I had really bad anxiety in school. But I found a way around it and I graduated. I couldn’t work at some of the jobs I had but I found a job and I really like it. I’m not anxious there at all. But I have another job that will lead to my career. They’ll pay me to learn, train, go to a school, and all I have to do is work for them for 2 years (It’s dog grooming). The problem is that it’s a lot. This is the second time I have had to leave cause my anxiety is so bad I threw up twice. I feel like I can’t learn or grow cause I’m scared the whole time. I’m behind in school work and spend the whole day dreading going there. But I like working with the dogs. I want to just work and send my self to dog grooming school but my mom thinks I should stay. She says I’m stronger than it and can do it. And that I shouldn’t let my anxiety win. But I’m just tired and don’t want to deal with the anxiety anymore if there is another way. I know it would be stupid to pass up this opportunity though 

Sorry this is so long"

Anxiety,Employment agent doesn't care about my anxiety and my other mental health and physical health issues.," 

I got diagnosed with severe burnout, anxiety and depression and I'm also suffering from a physical illnes that I don't wan't to get into detail and I'm not able to work, but I have to eat and pay rent so I applied for welfare and in the country I live you can't apply for welfare without registering yourself at an employment agency, so I did. And the lady who works at the employment agency is so pushy.Even though I showed proof from my doctor, psychologist and phsycal therapist, she still wants to send me to work. I politely told her that I'm not capable to work at the moment and this was her response:

""How can you say that without even trying? What else did you have in mind? Stay home all day and watch Netflix and chill while collecting your welfare check? You're still young and I want you to work""

So rude and degrading. I honestly see her as a bully. And no I'm sitting at home all day watching Netflix, I'm actuallly focused on getting beter. I go to the therapist and physical therapist several times a week. And even if I did stay at home and watched netflix all day, so what?? Why does she care? Luckily I got approved for welfare but my employment agent contacted my doctor, psychologist and phsycal therapist and all three of them told her the same thing I told her and I think that hurt her ego because she demanded from me to contact her in 2 months to see if I'm ready to go back to work. Some people might not like what I'm going to say but I need at least a year to get better and not 2 months. And I know that she is not giving me a year to recover so I'm preparing myself to get my welfare revoked, getting evicted out of my apartment, and become homeless. I'm so done with all of this."
Anxiety,Need to rant; health anxiety really screwing with my education and work.,"I have periods where I'm really fine which makes me think I don't actually have a problem and then periods where I am an absolute wreck. I've been having anxiety attacks almost daily and can never get myself to study because the minute I do I end up googling my symptoms or hyper fixating on some  bodily sensation and becoming too stressed to continue studying.

I'm honestly so sick of it, I can't tell if I actually should be this stressed out or if I'm just losing it mentally. I'm 20, not overweight, follow a pretty healthy diet. But somehow I'm convinced something is dreadfully wrong with my body. 

I've been experiencing random twitches all over my body and I know it can be a symptom of anxiety but my brains convincing myself it could be a symptoms of MS. Which it genuinely is and could be! **There is always that small fkn chance and I don't know how to cope with it.** 

I've also been having chest pains and actually had to end up in the emergency department a couple of days ago, they said im fine but im so convinced they missed something. 

Truly, I can't tell if I'm just dying or fked in the head."
Anxiety,Xanax or valium for severe fear of flying?,"I'm travelling very soon on a 7/8 hour flight, I'm absolutely terrified of flying. I'm not worried about the plane crashing, it's an intense fear of heights and wide open spaces.

I got 5mg valium tablets from my doctor but I'm worried I've made a mistake and should've went for xanax which is what I've taken before.. My tolerance is quite high and I do have to take a high dose to stop the severe anxiety.

Will valium suffice on this trip? Or should I try get xanax instead.

Also any general tips would be great."
Anxiety,Anxious to be with friends after sharing my story,"My husband and I are part of a Christian small group of six couples that meet weekly. We usually go through different books/studies together and discuss them when we meet. Recently, the group decided to take turns sharing our testimonies/stories. This past week was our turn. I debated on how much to share. Everyone was supportive and encouraging, but I’m stressing about seeing them again. I know they won’t judge me, but I can’t help but think things will be different after knowing my story. It’s just been stressing me out the past several days."
Anxiety,What kind of anxiety is it when you assume every pain and ache anywhere on your body is a symptom of a serious illness?,"Anytime I'm in discomfort (which is sadly every day), I assume I'm dying or have something serious that's not normal. I'm tired of feeling this way every day, it's like my mind is racing every minute on what could be wrong with me. I schedule doctor appointments often but when I go, they always tell me I'm fine but I have a hard time believing them. I feel like they could be wrong and overlooking things. What is wrong with me?

I haven't been able to see a therapist but I'm hoping to soon... I'm tired of always being this way. Feel like I don't belong in society."
Anxiety,6 Tips That Will Help You Meditate Effectively,"Are you looking for ways to increase your level of mindfulness and stay grounded in the present? Or do you just want to practice calming your mind and body each day? Meditation can be a great way to achieve these ends. It can also be frustrating and challenging at times. If you’re new to the practice, or need some help maintaining a regular meditation practice, you aren’t alone. Many people feel unsure about how to meditate or how beneficial it is. If you’re looking to increase your level of mindfulness and calm your mind, these tips will help you get started. Read on for six helpful tips that will help you meditate effectively.

## Set Up a Meditation Environment

You will be more likely to practice daily meditation if you set up an environment that supports the practice. Start by setting up your space to be as relaxing and calming as possible.

You can purchase meditation cushions, candles, ornaments, and other objects that will help create a peaceful and relaxing environment. Some people also like to keep their living room or bedroom clear of noisy electronics and clutter so they can focus better.

## Find a Quiet Place

You can’t meditate in a state of constant noise, so find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. Try to find a space where you can’t be disturbed even if you’re doing something as simple as brushing your teeth.

Keep in mind that this doesn’t mean that you have to sit in complete silence. You can listen to soft sounds (sounds that don’t carry too much energy, like the sound of rain, waves, a fan, or nature sounds) and even music (as long as it isn’t too distracting). You can also listen to guided meditations or podcasts when you can’t find anything else to listen to.

Find a place where you will feel comfortable and relaxed, and that will help you to be focused.

## Turn your electronics off

Electronics tend to be distracting. When you’re trying to quiet your mind, turning off your electronics can help you to avoid unwanted attention.

Some people find that they’re able to meditate better if they don’t have television, radio, or music playing in the background. If you’re in this boat, you can simply turn off the devices that are playing sounds. Other people prefer to completely turn their electronics off (including your phone) for the day and any meditation sessions that they’re trying to focus on their breathing and nothing else.

This doesn’t mean that you can’t meditate with your electronics at other times. It just means that when you’re trying to quiet your mind, you need to turn your attention away from the devices and toward what you’re doing.

## Find a comfortable position to sit in

You can’t meditate in a rigid, uncomfortable position, so find a comfortable position to sit in. If you’re doing a guided meditation, you may want to sit in a chair or on the floor so that you can relax into the pose. It’s also helpful to find a position that is relatively relaxed but upright so that your spine stays relatively straight. If you’re on your bed and want to sit up straight, you may find that it’s more comfortable to sit up in a cross-legged position (this is known as shavasana in Sanskrit).

You may find that sitting in a particular position or moving around a bit helps you to find a comfortable position to sit in. You may also want to try different positions until you find the one that works best for you. Remember, you don’t have to sit in one position for long periods of time; you can take a break if you need to, or simply change positions when you feel like it.

## Breathe into the moment

When you’re trying to quiet your mind, it can be helpful to focus on your breathing. When you’re first learning how to meditate, you may find that you’re too focused on your breathing to pay much attention to your thoughts. It can be a little like trying to empty your mind while you’re thinking really hard.

Try to relax and let your breathing slow down. You can focus on your breathing at the same time as you pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. You can even try counting your breaths if you want to focus on your breathing more than anything else.

## Notice your thoughts and let them go

When you notice a wandering thought, label it and then let it go. Say to yourself, “This thought is okay. I’ve let go of it and I’m now focusing on my breathing.” You can also try, “This thought is intruding again. I choose to notice it and let it be.”

When you notice that your mind is starting to wander, you can gently bring your attention back to your breath. You may also find that you’re able to focus better once you’ve put your phone away or out of sight.

## Do something kind for yourself every day

Taking care of yourself is crucial to the practice of meditation. You can’t meditate well if you’re not mentally and emotionally healthy. Try to do something kind for yourself every day, even if it’s just 10 minutes of meditation. This can include things like taking a bath or shower, doing a meditation breathing exercise, reading a book, doing yoga, or even taking a walk in nature.

You can also try using guided meditation to help you focus on your breathing and let go of the negative thoughts that can often plague us.

## Do something pleasant for 15 minutes at the end of your meditation

If you’re struggling to find something to do during your meditation, you can try using the last few minutes of your session to do something pleasant. Examples of pleasant activities include:

* Listening to your favorite music
* Spreading lavender or peppermint oil on your feet or hands and breathing in the scent
* Taking a walk in nature or the park
* Listening to guided imagery
* Creating something (drawing, writing, or building is best)
* Connecting with friends or family via social media
* Taking a bath or shower before bed

## Take a breath and think: Is meditation working for you?

When you’re first starting out, it can be hard to tell if you’re getting any benefit from meditation. You may feel like you’re spinning your wheels or moving in the wrong direction. If you feel like this, try to take a deep breath and relax. You may be right on track, or you may need to adjust your practice a little bit to get the most out of it.

If you’re not sure where to begin, try taking a mindful meditation challenge. There are many different ways to do this, and you can pick one that suits you best. You can also join a meditation group with like-minded individuals to support and guide you on your journey.

## Summary

Meditation is a powerful tool for healing and can also be used to reduce stress and increase concentration. There are many ways to practice meditation, and you can get started today with these tips."
Anxiety,Long term effects of taking Xanax occasionally?,"I take Xanax for emergencies, pretty much only when I fly so just 1mg every few months or so, or even less often. If I hypothetically continued this for the rest of my life would there be negative long term health/mental effects? 

Lol my anxiety is now worried I’m wrecking my brain and I’m sure you can all relate to that feeling."
Anxiety,Definition of Alcoholic?,"I have anxiety, and sometimes I wonder if I read into things too much. A while ago I posted here about my boyfriend who I grew concerned about that drinks too much. Enough so I was worried about him being an alcoholic. This was back in early February.

Since then, he has given up alcohol - but not permanently. It’s more of a temporary fix because of my anxiety. Frankly, I don’t have an issue if he drinks when he’s seeing his friends that live far away, because they see getting drunk as “fun”.  But he hasn’t been doing that.

At the end of April, his friend who lives several hours away is having a get together party. He hasn’t been drinking for several months, and has been just fine, which helps quell my fear a bit of him being an alcoholic. I think if he limits his over the top drinking to these few get together celebrations that on the weekend, it would be okay.

We’re moving soon, thank God, and he’ll be a bit farther from his friends which will make for fewer get together, but the get together a will actually be worth the celebration and not just having a party on the weekend. I don’t think I will ever understand the “fun” with drinking and parties. I clearly wasn’t that kind of person in college!

I suppose in some ways I’m looking for validation that having one party in April will be fine. I don’t think he’s an alcoholic, because he genuinely has showed no issues with letting it go."
Anxiety,Who else has gone back a medication they’ve been on before?,"So I have been on; Fluoxetine (Prozac), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Sertraline (Zoloft), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Vortioxetine (Trintillex), Bupropion on its own and augmentation with Fluoxetine, Clomipramine (Anafranil) Modafinil (Provigil), and Moclobemide augmentation with Aripiprazole (Abilify). 

I’m working out what I want to try next. It’s extremely difficult to get prescribed Irreversible MAOIs on the NHS in the UK. There’s several other drugs I would like to try, but they are not available here (and would require being imported). For example, Desipramine looked like a really good option, but was taken off the market here. If I was to try something new, it would be Imipramine, which is Desipramine’s cousin, and breaks down into Desipramine. However, I don’t know how reluctant my Psychiatrist will be to prescribe it. 

So I was wondering if anyone has gone back on a previous medication and found better success? I’ve been on so many over the years that, for some of them, I can remember how much they helped and whether it’s worth giving them another shot."
Anxiety,Coming off meds,"Hey folks, I need some guidance or people who can relate. 

I had been on anxiety/mood medication for over two years. My doctor is really lovely and he said that I could control my anxiety with meds and as well some changes to my life where should they say come I could easily come off these meds.

I tapered down my dose over the year to the point the next taper would be nothing left to take! 

Three weeks ago I started boy did I ever get that brain fog brain zap stuff. When that left me I continued to feel a bit hazy and thought I was on the up and up. 

Now, and this has been for 5 days now, I’ve felt irritable and moody and also feel a bit of anxiety. 

I just need some guidance or stories from people who may relate. Is this “normal”? 
How long should I ride this out to see if my life without meds is working? And how do I know that this is actually anxiety and not a withdrawal symptoms  and should maybe go back on meds.

tl:dr 
Stopped taking my meds under doctor supervision but now I feel weird and unsure what’s normal"

Anxiety,5 Stress-Reducing Techniques For Better Meditation: The Ultimate Guide,"The path to better meditation doesn’t just lie in learning more techniques and strategies — it also lies in making small changes to our everyday habits. Even the most dedicated of meditators can benefit from a few stress-reducing techniques, which will not only improve their meditation sessions, but also reduce their overall stress levels. 

If you’ve been feeling stressed lately, you’re not alone. With the world around us experiencing an unprecedented period of chaos, stress is no longer an “outward appearance” of our lives; it’s a genuine part of our experience. According to recent statistics, approximately 80% of the American public claims to be stressed out on a regular basis.

## Learn A New Strategy

When we feel stressed, the first thing most of us do is try to run from the situation — to push our feelings aside and “get back to business.” Unfortunately, this is often when our stress levels rise above critical mass, resulting in a cycle of stress that can last for weeks, months, or years.

As we’ve discussed, stress is a result of an OVERWHELMING experience; it’s not something you can simply “get over.” What you can do, however, is learn to manage it. The first step is to pinpoint the source of your stress — and then, once you’ve identified the problem, find a solution.

## Practice Breathing Exercises

Breathing exercises are perhaps the most basic and effective stress-reducing techniques out there. The reason they’re so effective is because they target the root cause of our stress response: the nervous system.

Breathing exercises teach our minds to control our breathing, thereby overriding the stress response and evoking a feeling of relaxation both mentally and physically. Some common breathing exercises are:

Belly breathing: During this breathing technique, we inhale and expand our bellies while exhaling and relaxing our upper chests and throats.

During this breathing technique, we inhale and expand our bellies while exhaling and relaxing our upper chests and throats. Short breathing: For this exercise, we simply hold our breath for about three seconds, then release and exhale for four more seconds.

Letting go: With this technique, we focus not on our breathing, but on the sensation of our breathing. As we exhale, we imagine our stress and anxiety “floating” away with the breath.

## Meditate Daily

As we’ve seen, practicing breathing exercises and learning new strategies isn’t a replacement for regular meditation; it’s a supplement that can work alongside it. What regular meditation does is provide a solid foundation for better stress-management techniques, allowing us to derive maximum benefit from them in the long run.

The benefits of meditation are practically endless, but one of the best things it can do for your stress levels is reduce your tendency to “react” to stress.

## Do Something You Love

The best stress-reducing techniques, like the best meditation strategies, aren’t about striving for perfection; they’re about making incremental improvements. After all, as with meditation, it’s not about how much you do, but about the quality of the “time off” you allow yourself from stress.

## Take A Walk In The Park

Like meditation, walking has many benefits for the mind and the body. But unlike meditation, which is often done in a “zen” setting, walking in the park can be done any time, any place. Which means it’s a great way to reduce your stress levels on the go — and even better, it doesn’t require any special equipment.

## Learn How To Say No

Unfortunately, life isn’t always going to be “fair” — and when it comes to our stress response, that means sometimes saying no to people, obligations, and requests that areنunnecessarily stressful or draining.

## Establish A “Safe Space”

Sometimes, the only way to get through a stressful situation is to leave your comfort zone and create some space between you and the source of your stress.

This could mean scheduling a “time out” to call or text a friend; walking a different route to and from work; or scheduling a “virtual” appointment with a friend via Skype or FaceTime.

## Conclusion

Meditation and breathing exercises are both effective at reducing stress, but they work best when paired with other stress-reducing techniques. Try combining them with one of the following hacks:

* Schedule a daily meditation practice.
* Commit to taking a daily “me time” where you do nothing but relax and unwind.
* Do something you love.
* Take a walk in the park.
* Learn how to say no.
* Establish a “safe space.”
* Conclusion 

Meditation and breathing exercises are powerful ways to reduce stress, but they’re only part of the equation when it comes to better stress-management. If you want to achieve true calmness and happiness, you have to use a variety of techniques to reduce your overall stress levels."

There are many reasons why you should talk to someone you trust. You can talk to someone about your feelings, receive support, and figure out what’s causing your anxiety. Talking to a professional could be a good idea if you haven’t already. You could discuss your symptoms with a mental health professional and see if they are related to anxiety. It’s important to remember that anxiety is a common condition and is treatable.

## Exercise regularly

Exercising regularly can help reduce and manage your anxiety. It can also improve your mood and increase your energy levels. There are many types of exercises you can do.

Learning a new skill can help you feel productive and able to contribute to society.

## Do Something Different

Doing something different can help you break the cycle of anxiety and boredom. Sometimes, doing the same thing over and over can become a source of anxiety. So, change it up.

Doing something different will give your brain some visual stimulation and keep your mind busy.

## Reduce stress in your life

Stress can trigger anxiety in many people. Try to reduce the amount of stress in your life. It can be difficult, but it’s important. Stress can cause muscle spasms and provoke an anxious response. It can also cause high levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, which can increase your anxiety. So, try to avoid stress as much as possible. Reducing the amount of stress in your life will allow your body to relax and your mind to have a break. This can help reduce your anxiety.

When you have a plan, your mind has something to focus on and it will not wander as much. It will also help you to stay more organized which will reduce anxiety.

Or, you may have a high heart rate from the intensity of the activity. There are ways to prevent this. The first is to condition your body to be more calm during and after exercise. This can be done through yoga, tai chi, or breathing exercises. The second is to distract yourself during exercise. This can be done through visualizing something nice or funny, or by listening to your favorite playlist on your phone.

## Learn how to manage your emotions

Anxiety and stress are triggered by and rooted in emotions. Therefore, the best way to overcome anxiety is to learn how to manage your emotions. This means learning how to control your thoughts and feelings so that you do not feel overwhelmed.

There are a variety of ways to do this. One way is to journal about your emotions. By writing them down, you are more likely to examine them and begin to see that they are not as bad as you made them out to be.

Another way is to talk to a loved one or close friend about how you are feeling. This can help you to put your feelings into perspective and gives you someone to talk to when you are upset.

## Find a hobby you enjoy

Do you have a hobby you enjoy? If so, it can be a great way to reduce your anxiety. Choose a hobby that helps you to relax, get your mind off of things, and becomes part of your routine.

Some examples of hobbies people enjoy are: reading, art, scrapbooking, photography, needlework, gardening, and housekeeping.

## Set Realistic Goals

Set realistic goals for yourself and do not set goals for things that are unobtainable. This will help to avoid setting yourself up for failure and will actually give you room for improvement.

When setting goals, break them down into smaller goals. This way, you have something to work toward and will be more likely to achieve them.

## Do something good for yourself

It is important to do something good for yourself each day. Taking care of yourself is the best way to stay healthy and reduce anxiety. Some things that you can do for yourself include: taking a hot shower or bath, doing something calming like yoga, meditation, or tai chi, eating a healthy snack, etc.

## Bottom line

Anxiety,Is this a panic attack?,"I’m not sure exactly if what I’m having is a panic attack I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have been getting tested for bpd. 

The main thing that makes me not sure is that it’s about specific events so I’ll suddenly remember back to one of my favourite times with my ex and I suddenly get an overwhelming amount of anxiety, I start breathing heavy my throat gets dry and sore, I feel like crying, and I start remembering all the things they said about me and how it’s all true and how I’ll be alone forever and I can’t sit still.

I'll be specific, circumcision. I was very much full forced introduced with the information. I was so shocked. The shock still stays with me, I guess. 

I recall going through those dates indicated by the backups and I felt like I was anticipating something. It wasn't good anticipation. I was breathing heavily and I was just waiting then poof, gone. 

All the bad things that my brain did to make sense of the shocking information I got from two years ago. Goddamn. 

The feeling is still there. I was advised to just let it be, don't think of it too much. Maybe that's what happened. I wasn't really paying attention. 

The old habits I had were rearing their heads but they didn't stay long. Oh, I hated those habits. Those damnable habits, I curse my mind for forming them.

I’m now sitting in my car with my cheats pounding , no one to talon to so I’m writing this here. I also don’t know how to explain to my friends I’m having a panic attack because men are giving me an uncomfortable amount of attention and my boss is being too comfortable with me after a few days of working together .

Anxiety,Mini Sucesss,So before going on long trips (something more than 30-40 minutes) I would get really anxious and it would only be if I was driving with other people and that would result in me throwing up before going on the trip. This would happen consistently and then me and my friends decided to drive to Panama City Beach from Missouri for spring break and I was worried about being out of my environment and my anxiety getting really bad. When going there I threw up within 10 minutes of getting in the car. We were there for 5 nights and went out every night to the local clubs/bars and it was rough the first day or 2. I would have to step out to take a breather then go back in. But eventually my worry had gone and I was fine going out and having fun. And then on the drive back home I wasn’t anxious and didn’t throw up once. I was scared at first to get out of my comfort zone and do things that gave me anxiety but eventually my brain learned it wasn’t too bad after all :). So when going back to college I plan on trying to get out of my routine and do things that will cause me anxiety to try and reduce it overall. Thanks for reading all of this!
Anxiety,One step at a time …,"So since the delta variant was here, I wore FFP2 masks. I have always been absolutely terrified of covid because one of my family members is high risk. 

Even since the mask mandate has been removed and even though the numbers are going down, the masks were always a shield, and kind of became a comfort blanket (in an unhealthy way) so I still wore them, even when there was no one around inside and were not really necessary. 

But today, I decided to go into my local shop, who only had 3-4 people in it, without my mask on. I would only be a minute or so. But the whole time my heart was racing and I pretty much held my breath. Once I left, I took a massive deep breath and walked home. 

Masks are still important in crowded or busy areas and I will be still wearing them in those environments, but they can’t be my comfort blanket. The person who is high risk is literally flying to France this month. They are moving on better than myself. 

I’m not even sure if it was a success, as it’s so tiny and covid is still very much around. But at least I am finally starting to move on."

Anxiety,I'm having major anxiety about school and stuff.,"I went to in person but I would get very anxious to the point where I would get sick and I'd stay home, as a result my grades would plummet. so I thought online school would help, but I was wrong. I want to pass but it just seems impossible. I would go back but I'd most likely have to do more school. I probably fucked up my chances of graduating on time. I try to not care about school but it always bothers me but when I go to do it I end up having bad anxiety and never get anything done.
I'm thinking about going back to in person next year but this same thing will most likely happen and I just don't know what to do anymore. I can feel myself getting more unhinged I guess is the only way I can put it. I haven't been able to get any sleep or anything done. every day gets more tiring than the last and I just want to stay in bed. I have no motivation to get anything done."
Anxiety,I feel like idk how to read my body anymore,"I have been dealing with agoraphobia since the pandemic started.

Now, when I get into the gym and feel that tightness in my chest &amp; I convince myself to leave. I was pushing through that anxious feeling before and felt great after a gym session. Now, I feel like I don't know the difference between when I need to push through that feeling and when I should remove myself from a situation. I feel so disconnected from my body and it makes me so sad. I feel like I'm taking steps backwards and I feel a little discouraged because I was just fine. Kinda just feel like I'm spiraling.

Anxiety,Anxiety Symptoms?,"Yesterday evening I was winding down to go to bed when i suddenly felt a cold/tingly rush down the front my head. I thought i was dying.

I woke up multiple times last night with the same cold/tingly feeling on my head and a feeling like i’m about to die. Today it’s felt like i’m on the verge of another attack, and have had a few close calls. It’s been over 48 hours where Ive felt like this out of nowhere. I now feel like i’m sick or something, and dizzy. My fingers will occasionally get really tingly. Is this anxiety? I’ve never felt like this before and it’s been a whole 24 hours now of fighting off an attack. should i be worried? I don’t know what’s happening."

I can breathe perfectly, it’s not impacting my day to day life, but it’s still scaring me. The feeling is hard to describe, it’s like a mild vibration if that makes sense and it’s constant even when I’m totally relaxed. I genuinely can’t tell if it’s my heart or some other muscle or tissue in that inner left breast area. I can put my hand over my heart and feel it beat normally, but at the same time I feel that vibration feeling. I do plan on making a doctor’s appointment soon. What do y’all think?"

My uncle says my house is haunted and it scares the crap out of me when he says it. All because he said he felt something when he was on the couch. Now he said he was under the influence when this happened.
  But I’m getting freaked out because once he mentioned it my dog has been avoiding her bed and running to me. She started sniffing a lot too in my room. While also she had just stared under my bed and ran to me. Its making me think something is wrong. It’s really getting to me and I can’t sleep because I’m freaked out.

Anxiety,Any tips for morning anxiety?,"I have quite stressful time recently and the mornings are the worst. I think it's because of high cortisol levels, it's often between 7-10 AM. If I wake up earlier I feel fine and then always around 7Am I feel tense, nauseus, shaking etc. It's really difficult to stop it, I take valerian root mostly right after I wake up and thourough the day. It's not possible for me to take normal anti-anxiety meds right now. I've tried deep breathing, self-soothing massage but it's not really giving much. Recently I've started to listen to isochronic tones and that helps a bit but, only as long as I have my headphones on and I can't always have IT all the time. Later in the day I usually feel better, it's just the few hours in the morning tha are hell and I don't really know how to help myself anymore."

Anxiety,Daydreaming &amp; Anxiety,"
Hi
So I had been seeing my previous therapist for about five months before I opened up about these sort of daydreaming spells I get into.

I tend to have social encounters with people, not bad encounters or good encounters necessarily, but after these encounters when I’m alone I physically see this persons face in my head and think about all of the things I should have or could have said in the conversation. Most of the time I tend to have these thoughts out loud and will say exactly what I think I should have said and how I think they would have responded. Sometimes I imagine other people in the scenario who were not apart of the social encounter and include them in the scenario playing out in my head. I also add dialogue of what I believe this person would say in this situation sometimes. Sometimes I get so caught up in these conversations that my roommate will enter the room and ask what I am doing or who I am talking to.

When I explained this to my therapist, she was quick to blame it on social anxiety. I do believe I really do have anxiety and am prescribed medicine for this anxiety, however, some of my friends who also have anxiety that I have talked to have not had this similar experience that I have had. To wrap this up, I’m wondering if anyone else with anxiety goes through similar daydreaming spells where they find themselves picturing people in their head and making up dialogue to conversations."
Anxiety,Worried about sleep,"Tw: Death
I’m sorry to vent all this, but this feels impossible to deal with right now.

I’m having a really hard time right now. In summer of 2020, I had this anxiety about dying in my sleep. I managed to get past it, and I was fine up until now.

The anxiety came back a little over a month ago now. I’m worried about going to sleep even though as far as I know, I’m totally healthy. I have no genetic disorder that would cause that to happen, or sleep apnea. I’m actually healthier than I was when I had the anxiety the first time. I got very bad sleep yesterday cause of it, to the point of now I wonder if I even got sleep, and I need to get up in about 5 hours to do stuff. I’m worried about dying and now whether or not I will get enough sleep."
Anxiety,nausea/throwing up with muscle pains?,"is this normal? i dont want to call hospital to bother them, but i worry im not ok.. i pulled my muscles the other day with stretching, and they have hurt since, more of a mild burning pain. i threw up from it too and now i feel nauseous again, trying not to throw up. i feel just sick in general."
Anxiety,edibles ruined my life,"i used to regularly take edibles and just chill before bed, but one night back in november my heart rate spiked and i ended up vomiting a few times. of course i’m stupid and a couple nights later i went right back to it and my heart rate shot up, i was nauseous, my jaw and neck were tingling, my hands were numb and there was an intense pressure in my chest so i genuinely thought i was having a heart attack. 

i ended up going to urgent care and they did an x ray and ekg and both were normal. but i haven’t been the same since. every day since then it’s been a living nightmare. i can’t function. i cry randomly, i have heart palpitations, it feels like i can’t breathe. i’ve been clenching my jaw so hard i’ve chipped two teeth. i either feel like i’m going to drop dead or i start feeling detached from reality. i’ve become an intense hypochondriac and i’m always convinced something’s going to kill me. every night i just lay in bed and listen to my heart pound and worry that something is wrong with me.

i’ve never really struggled with anxiety before this and i genuinely don’t know how i can deal with it any longer. i’m going to therapy and i’m getting on medication but i can’t live like this for the rest of my life. has anyone else ever had this happen and how are you dealing with it?"
Anxiety,Worried that medication could change my creativity.,"I have been recommended medication for my anxiety by multiple people. but I'm worked it will effect my art, music, and writing. I don't want to be emotionless or have a dulled mind from taking medication.

Is there any kind of medication that wont do that? I can beardly work on my artistic skills at all right now, presumably from my anxiety and partly depression."
Anxiety,What we know about the mind and what is causing your problems.,"Whilst it is true that there is a lot about the mind we do not currently understand it is also true that we know enough to do much better when it comes to dealing with mental health issues.  

On one hand there are psychologists who do not believe our minds have a conscious and unconscious delineation. This is largely due to challenges associated with scientifically testing and proving the thesis beyond any doubt. However there are plenty of smart people who believe the unconscious mind does exist. Neuroscientists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky both received a 2002 Nobel Prize for their work in this field. So a lot of people know we have a conscious and an unconscious mind. They just cannot prove it beyond doubt at this stage. 

We know that emotions are caused by the release of neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin. We know that our thoughts regulate the release of these chemicals. Sad thoughts equal sad emotions. And do we know what else triggers the release of neurochemicals? Our friend, the unconscious mind. Are your symptoms the result of a chemical imbalance? You could say that. But the source of the chemical imbalance is the faulty signalling coming from your unconscious.  

In closing we know enough to come to the following conclusion. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression or associated issues then the cause can be found in your unconscious.  A different starting position at best will send you the long way round in your search for a solution. At worst it will send you in the wrong direction.

Anxiety,Random intrusive thought,"Well a few days ago I had a good amount of laundry to do and I realized I overloaded the washer and was also tired and needed to go to bed also was smoking weed trying to relax...

I took out like 1/2 of the laundry and didn’t know what to do so I put it on a piece of cardboard and a plastic bag (not sure WTF I was doing) and went to bed 


So now I remembered the leftover laundry and quickly went down and threw that damp laundry in the wash.... cold basement etc. I worried if the laundry could’ve developed mold? IDK also smoke cigs and I noticed my throat felt weird but it could be cotton mouth?

I’m overthinking? Sorry this is kinda embarrassing..."
Anxiety,Having to talk to people triggers my anxiety.,"Even people whom I'm close to.

Chatting is okay, calling works sometimes, but I can't handle talking face-to-face. Once I even burst out crying due to having to talk to a stranger for too long.

I reckoned this will do me harm, if not a lot of harm. How should I cope with this?

Thanks in advance."
Anxiety,Hi everyone,"Well where do I begin it’s the first time I’ve ever made a post on Reddit but I dunno I just need some advise, help .

Anxiety,Tongue twitching? Help!,"Does anyone else get this symptom? I can feel my tongue lightly twitching on the side and sometimes it will move to the other side. I’ve had twitching and some muscle aches all over my body for 5 days. I have an extensive blood test done with no finding.. doctor thinks it’s just anxiety but I can’t help but think it’s something more serious. 

Did anyone else have this and how long did it take to go away?"
Anxiety,How can you guys manage going to college?,"I literally can't do this. I've been somewhat able to confront most of my anxiety related issues but I can't do this at all. 
 
I can't seem to find one opportunity to try to talk with somebody and even then, I can't think of anything to talk about without making it sound like awkward small talk. Everyone seems to have at least a friend to hang out with. I have none, I don't know anybody here. Even worse, I have to sit alone everytime because I was late one day.
 
Man, this makes me feel so pathetic and ashamed of myself. How the hell can you guys do it?"
Anxiety,i am deathly terrified of my cat having rabies,"i apologize if rabies posts are common here, but I'm seriously concerned.  
my family and me, we are poor and my family thinks I'm crazy for thinking our cat has rabies   
but recently, my cat has been:  
1. meowing alot   
2. licking his lips  
3. his tail is down all the time   
4. his eyes are constantly half closed  
my family said the reason he is meowing alot is because we took away this can of cat food they bought for him but it was bad for him and he ended up throwing up, so they threw it away, and our neighborhood has some feral cats but they have never step foot in this house, my cat is a indoor cat and my family also says he was vaccinated 2019, but they don't seem confident in that answer, should I actually be concerned or am I overreacting here?   


sidenote: me, both of my sisters and my neice got scratched and bitten by the cat since we love to play with him"
Anxiety,Back pain on upper right side to neck worsens,"For the last 4 days I've been having a back pain that worsens, I can't even eat without feeling nauseous, is it anxiety, I fear y may have an aortic aneurysm or dissection even if I had an ultrasound just yesterday and they said it was fine"
Anxiety,Heart palpitations / health anxiety,"I have had anxiety my whole life &amp; health anxiety. Especially about heart stuff. I’ve had lots of ekgs last year &amp; even had heart ultrasound, stress test, all normal. 

Anyways sometimes I get heart palpitations where it feels like my heart skips a beat or something in my chest. Or a flutter feeling. I hate those cause they always send me into anxiety no matter how many times I’ve had them in life. As I was trying to fall back asleep a bit ago I had one so of course now I can’t sleep anymore &amp; am anxious. 

Anyone else get them too?"
Anxiety,just had bad panic attack(need hugs),"i have been worried about my health lately. i have had GAD &amp; health anxiety  for years, but its been just anxiety attacks, but today all of sudden i got panic attack when at work.

 i started to feel like im going to faint, heart raced,  vision went weird, hyperventilated, shaky, i ran around in panic, called my parent to pick me up from work, cried hysterically.. my face was pale as it can be, i felt blood rushing away from my limbs &amp; head.. i seriously thought, this is it, i will die. i just ran away. im going to see a doc later for blood test, because i have been feeling so sick lately. i want to confirm it was just panic attack. im so scared, still."
Anxiety,Does anyone call into work often?,"I’m completely exhausted and haven’t been sleeping well at all. I’m on my feet at work all day &amp; always moving &amp; lifting stuff. Well I also have bad anxiety too. I call into work at least 1-2 times a month I feel like. I have lost a job in the past due to the attendance. I started a job in November and have called in already probably like 5 times total. I want to call in today really bad cause I’m having a bad mental day, my anxiety is bad &amp; I haven’t slept well in days, I am beyond exhausted. Mind you this job is full of toxic people that also drains me. I just want to stay home today but I know that if I do, coworkers will talk crap about me &amp; etc. This job is so unprofessional, manager is unprofessional. 
I just wanna cry."
Anxiety,Advice,"First post and I apologize if my grammar and punctuation is bad. Everyday of my life I've been full of stress and I can tell that its a giant part of my life. Since Elementary I've been bullied for my looks, and how I act. My Dad gave me the role as the ""man of the house"", and wants me to take care of my mom. ETC. Even now when I've been taking steps to take care of my mom like paying the bills, I found myself unable to go to work. My work life was short, but I tried my best to keep myself going. I just had to quit from the fact I couldn't even go anymore from the constant fear of what people think, who im affecting, what life ill have to live. I want to help people but I can barely breathe.

The reason I quit work in more detail is because every morning I would wake up and immediately vomit, and then proceed to cry non stop with racing thoughts. I then wouldn't be able to eat the whole day. I feel so useless, and I know that this is me. I've been doing this same throwing up and unable to enjoy my life since Elementary. I've been trying medication, and therapy, I've also tried breathing techniques, and how to keep myself in the moment, but it doesn't ever work. I get a wave of uncontrollable fear and stress that I can't fight against or even understand. I have a very hard time being around people from trauma, and I just want to stay home, but that won't help my Mom. Im stuck and im suffocating, I cant enjoy what I used to and I find myself over sleeping, and counting down the hours of the day, and just waiting for the next day to be stressful. I dont know who's gonna read this, but if you do can you maybe give advice, or someone tell me they're going through the same feeling of constant fear and self hatred? Thank you for reading. I wish I could give more detail so you guys would understand, but I dont know how."
Anxiety,I wish someone had told me I was suffering as a kid,"Looking back, I never knew how bad I was actually suffering as a kid from anxiety. I always thought everyone felt the same way I felt and that I just didn't handle it the same way. My anxiety growing up surrounded around school, sports, and socially.

I was a straight A student so everyone thought I was doing great, but I was only a straight A student because of my anxiety. If I got even an A- on an assignment, it felt like my whole world was falling apart. I would have the most gut wrenching feeling when I had to take tests that would last until I got the results back. The worst was oral presentations. If on the first day of school a teacher said we had a to give a presentation on the last day of school, I'd have that gut wrenching feeling all year until the presentation was over.

In high school, I went as far as trying to break my hand with a hammer to try and get out of a track meet I was nervous about. The things I went through were so fucked up and nobody knew a thing. I don't know what made me look back on life, but I wish someone had told me the feelings I was having weren't my fault and weren't normal. I wish I had gotten help to relieve the pain I went through for so long."
Anxiety,Can someone please talk to me,I just woke up with a panic attack and u want to talk to someone. Can someone talk to me?
Anxiety,Is this normal?,"Im not asking for a medical diagnosis. 

Im going to my nurse next week to ask to get an MRI scan. 

Been on prozac close to a year. Got off it few days ago. Yes, I slowed tapered off it week by week properly. 

I've been having very weird tingling/zapping feelings throughout my body. Sometimes my face goes numb, teeth, arms, mainly my head. 

The worrying thing is... It happened when I wasn't even getting off of it. Im worried this is permanent, or i have some serious damage in my brain. 

If its the meds then im lucky. If its not im most likely dying tbh"
Anxiety,Daytime anxiety,"Hi. I have a problem and would like to hear your opinion.
I'll tell you my entire story. Sorry in advance for my non perfect english...

In july i got vaccinated and after 2 days i got tinnitus. I went to MR for head and neck and everything was ok. In the hospital they gived me Medrol (methylprednisolone). I had to take it for 2 weeks. After 3 days of taking my tinnitus worsened and i got bad insomnia. After 3 weeks dealing with hardcore insomnia my doc gived me Trazodone (first 50mg... Ended on 150mg). I've taken it from september to december. In october/november i had daytime feeling of anxiety in my body. I know it's from SSRI, because i never had this feeling before in my life. In december all was stable and i decided with my doc, that i can quit taking it (my sleep was ok and no anxiety). I also had some kind of hives on skin every evening (from starting to take trazodone). On january 7 u decided to quit smoking, because of tinnitus, sciatica etc... I started to take 1mg melatonin at night, because of nicotine withdrawal. On january 31 i woke up with the anoying anxiety feeling in my body. Till today i can't get rid of it. The strange thing of this anxiety is that it start in the morning..and at 9pm i am completely fine. Like i never had anxiety before. 

Do you think is some anxiety rebound from SSRI or nicotine withdrawal? Or maybe from melatonin? 
My mind is completely ok...i  don't have any anxiety toughts on anything... I can laugh, play guitar etc... And i have this feeling inside my body. It's difficult to live like that. I want to avoid going back to SSRI because with that my tinnitus is worse than ever. My doc gived me Brintellix (vorioxetine) if i want to start taking it. Really don't know what to do. This week i bought some Theanine and magnesium glycinate. It helps somehow..but i want to get rid of this anxiety."
Anxiety,Fear before everything,"Before simple tasks, usually the one i dont know how would go. Sometimes like thinking of unpacking sounds too big and scary. I feel very scared. Is this anxiety? Why am I scared before most of the things. Why not any other emotions? Is there anybody like me? I have noticed people around me are not always scared.."
Anxiety,I feel like I can’t enjoy big life events (like graduation or wedding) because of anxiety,"My wedding is coming up in a few months and I feel nauseous thinking about it, even though my family and friends are going out of their way to make it special. I can’t even pinpoint why but I feel like I’ll be anxious throughout. How do you deal with this?"
Anxiety,Got anxiety after my father's death,"Without revealing too much about myself, I'm a male in my early 20s and normally full of life and without a care in the world. I'm also practically fearless, not being afraid of things like spiders, snakes and heights, but also things like rejection, becoming old alone etc. A couple of weeks ago, my loving father died due to a terminal illness. I've been doing pretty alright, until yesterday.

Yesterday, I went out with two friends. At one point, they both went to the toilet and stayed away for quite a long time. Turns out one of them suddenly felt nauseous and they had to get bar staff to help them a bit. However, I didn't know that at the time, and because they stayed away for so long, I started to panic. I became restless, constantly looking around me, thinking I had said something bad or acted badly in a way they didn't like. It felt like they had left me. I even started to hyperventilate a bit. When they finally returned, I was so relieved. Later in the night, I had to throw up because of too much alcohol (we all drank a lot) and I constantly excused me and told them I was sorry I was bothering them so much and that I was an asshole for ruining the night (which in hindsight is stupid, because we were at home when it happened and we were getting ready to go to bed). I also called myself an asshole the entire night in my thoughts. If you ever saw the ""Stupid Piece of Sh\*t"" episode from Bojack Horseman, it felt a lot like that. I spoke with them about it later and turns out that they still love me and didn't feel like I bothered them at all. I'm so happy for this, but still, right now, I have this feeling that they actually hate me behind my back and just acted nice, which I know isn't true because they're some of my greatest friends. I also told them about this ""fear"" of them leaving me alone that I experienced yesterday and how it is bothering me.

Is this anxiety? Is it normal to get anxiety after a close family member's death? And what are some tips to combat anxiety? This is all new for me and I'm scared."
Anxiety,Are you overwhelmed by your smell ?,"For some context, I tend to be really overwhelmed by the noise and the lights if there's too much going on at the same time. I also have this disease called sinusitis and I barely smell anything. I don't take care of it because I'm afraid of being overwhelmed with my smell too, but I recently realized that I wasn't even looking for actuals answer instead of my feelings so here I am. Could you please help me with this ?"
Anxiety,Do certain noises/ sounds you can't control give you anxiety?,"Its so weird how noises that you can't control can have a such an impact on one's anxiety. Like if I'm working and I hear people coming upstairs I get anxious and panicky, when I'm using a public bathroom and people are talking it gives me anxiety, when I'm trying to sleep and I hear birds singing at nighttime, that also gives me anxiety!

Does anyone else have this same thing that occurs on a daily basis, Is there anything that helps you to not get anxious over uncontrolled noises?"
Anxiety,Need copy of diagnosis for work,"Just as the title says. Currently see a psychiatrist but last time I requested this info they refused to give it to me? I need this to give to work for having a LoA, how can I go about getting a letter from them stating I’ve been being seen for x,y,z for however long?"
Anxiety,Fear over taking diazepam,"I have health anxiety which had been causing panic attacks daily due to a traumatic event 
My psychologist prescribed 2mg of diazepam 

Ive just taken my first dose but fear over the possible side effects is killing me a little- 

Its just for short term whilst i wait for my regular anxiety meds to kick in with a higher dose but im so scared smth is going to happen to me"
Anxiety,The thing I realized about my anxiety...,"Hi everyone,

Long time anxiety-et here, I get panic attacks and I also cannot sleep because of anxiety.

One thing I realized about my anxiety is that;

\- I have a ton of things to worry about, is it going to work out? The question pops into my head!

\-- I start to think that if I actively think about it, I actively ""keep it under control"" and things will work out because \*\*I worry\*\*

\-- I feel like if I don't worry, I don't work on these things, I just let anything happen, therefore nothing is going to work out.

I think what I need to learn is to not correlate anxiety with the ingredient for a positive outcome. It does not correlate, yet in my mind, I think my worries are ""work"" that I put into presumably solving the bad things in my life"".

What do you think?"
Anxiety,I Can't Stop Being Anxious About Myself,"It feels like I am been on edge for almost a year now. I started a journey of self-discovery and trying to help my issues like anxiety and depression that have wracked me since childhood but the problem is I can't stop thinking about it all day for months now. I am constantly googling things, posting or looking up stuff on reddit, even coming to conclusions that are actively harming my self-help like self-diagnosis instead of just helping deal with what I already know and I feel like I have been just in general very impatient and uncomfortable feeling for months now.

I have found it very hard to sit down and do things I have normally enjoyed without my mind wandering towards continuing to look up more stuff and trying to find reason for my issues and the absolute worst part is that I am already getting the help I need. I am already in the process of just starting therapy, I am talking with my doctor about further blood work because of my hypothyroidism and antidepressants once my tests are back and all I need to do is chill and wait since things like this take time but for some reason I can't chill and it's greatly affecting both my mental health I am trying to fix and the ability to relax and do things I normally enjoy.

Any advice or anything on how the hell can I stop myself from obsessing day in and day out and go back to relaxing like I was easily able to do before? There is literally 0 urgency but maybe I am just overall impatient because I want to get better."
Anxiety,Is this an anxiety attack?,"So my wife has always had anxiety, fairly under control only occasionally having panic attacks.

However last night was something she’s never experienced before and frankly I had no idea how to handle besides trying to calm her.

She was feeling fine all day I went to bed and she came a few hours later feeling fine. She then was trying to go to sleep and told me she doesn’t feel right and sat up. A few minutes later she has this huge episode of complete fear. Like everything I was scary and she couldn’t understand why. She was actually scared of me and thinking she shouldn’t be here (in our house) bursting into tears. But she knew she was being irrational but couldn’t control it. This lasted for about 5min probably but felt like hours. I was just wondering if this would go along with an anxiety attack? She’s never had it it before and it came suddenly and without warning."
Anxiety,Why on earth are people so cruel to each other?,"I always thought that one should in general treat others with kindness and try to so as much as possible - and while I have experienced much kindness in life myself, I continue to be shocked at how unnecessarily mean people can be. Why can't we all just get along or at least try to be civil to each other when disagreements arise? Why the fuck is bullying and mobbing at the work place still tolerated these days? Why does nobody speak up when it happens?"
Anxiety,Rabbit hole of thoughts..,"For the past few weeks, my mind went back and forth from negative to positive thoughts.
And yesterday, it just came crashing down the rabbit hole of negativity. 

 I'm better off alone. 

It's never easy for me to befriend people let alone fall for someone. The one time I do, I put my heart into it.  Then my anxiety takes control and I felt like I couldn't trust him for multitude of reasons. One of which that triggered a fear from the past. A fear I never learned to overcome and is currently working on with a therapist. 

I feel like the only people who will always be there are the people I met and truly understood my past and have seen what I've been through medically. Which is really just two people. It's incredulous to think friends on the internet would love me for me when they never met me. Yet the closest friends tell me they will always be there no matter what. Again, I get skeptical despite calling them my besties, my sister, the people I trust and love.  I've always been the one people bullied, ostracised, left alone despite not doing anything to anyone. It manifested hatred and distrust in people and further aggravated into general anxiety disorder. 
I... didn't want to be like this yet it ended up feeling like I couldn't believe anyone. Like I was better off alone after all. 

Thinking about all of this all day and night made me lose the self control I had for weeks. I didn't feel happy nor sad, yet there I was just.. crying. I felt alone for weeks but never reached out.. because honestly it's better to be alone.
I didn't want to burden anyone with my overthinking thoughts because it's going to be the same thing over and over. My mind just repeats the same thing. It had manifested into my dreams and made things worse. At the end of the day, what truly took control of me is just fear."
Anxiety,switching anxiety medications,my new psychiatrist switched me off of hydroxyzine that i was in for months to buspirone yesterday. i’m taking a small dosage in the morning and at night. she also put me on lexapro and i’ve never been on an antidepressant before. i was actually very scared and very anxious to take new medicine. is there any advice for me or things i should be wary of with these and do they actually help?
Anxiety,My anxiety is so high that I can't drink water.,"I just can't drink water. I feel so anxious. I don't have any thoughts or anything. It's just my body. I barely slept. My body feels very warm. I feel tired, but my anxiety is keeping me highly alert.

Any advice?"
Anxiety,I don’t know what to do anymore,18M. I have a swollen lymph node on the left and right side of my neck. I did an ultrasound and one came back benign. Then a few days later I noticed another one on the other side. Now I feel something else in my neck but i don’t know if it’s another lymph node or not. I’ve received blood work and it’s normal as well as the ultrasound so that rules out cancer. What the hell is wrong with me? These lymph nodes have been swollen for 3 months.
Anxiety,Feeling Stressed and awkward around this woman in office?,"Im 30 Male. So recently there is an attractive woman in my office. Whenever she is around, I felt anxious and awkward. I don't know why. She is married. This is making me stressed out. Any advice?"
Anxiety,Any tips for flight anxiety?,"I’ve always been an extremely anxious flyer but it’s gotten a lot worse since having a child. I’ll be flying a 14-hour flight in two weeks and every time I think about it, I get the worst anxiety. I’ve taken this same flight tons of times but have never been able to get any sleep. 

I don’t feel comfortable taking medication as I’ll be traveling alone but what are some things I can do to make the trip a bit more bearable?"
Anxiety,Irrational fear of lifts.,"i have an irrational fear of getting stuck in lifts forever. i had almost fully started using lifts without any fear but today, a lift got stuck in front of me. i’m very triggered and i climbed up 14 floors to avoid the lifts. my body aches, i can’t do this everyday."
Anxiety,(Tw death) im constantly terrified,"im always so scared about death. I hate this so much. I’ve been so anxious about it that I can’t sleep at night, I can’t eat, I can’t be alone. I cant stop thinking about it. Yesterday I started zoloft for severe anxiety and I was wondering if that could help some please"
Anxiety,I know it’s silly but….,I picked up a metal rack of shelves that someone left out for the trash and even though I lysoled them and wiped them down with Mr. Clean I still feel anxious about the possibility that they’re still dirty. I know it’s silly to feel so nervous but I do and I had to tell someone.
Anxiety,"My journey, overcoming OCD/ Mental health","  

Hi everyone,

   
 

So over the past few weeks I have been toying with the idea of starting a blog/personal journal, which I would share, that details how I dealt with my OCD and mental health, where I was significantly impaired due to the severity and complexity of my case.

   
 

I'd like to extend my help and experience to my fellow OCD'ers and people who suffer with mental health. I independently overcame many obstacles and challenges that no doctor, therapist, counselor, psychiatrist could ever help or diagnose. I have survivors remorse, by knowing I have the knowledge that by sharing could help others in coping with their conditions and daily challenged.

   
 

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks :)"
Anxiety,My mental health is falling apart because of ukraine,[removed]
Anxiety,I am at such a weird place in my mind.,"So how all of this started i guess , my boyfriend and I decided to breakup ( i would like to call it mutual because the reason is quite understandable) he has his very important paper coming up for which he wanted no distraction , he wants to put his 100% in studies ( which I completely get and i am totally fine with it ) ofcourse it was very hurtful for both of us but it is what it is . He also said that as soon as his paper ends he would definitely want to give this relationship another chance and put his 100% in it . He said he would try his best to get everything back to normal . 
He clearly stated that he wants to date me after his paper . I am completely fine with it because i wanna give him all the support i can . 
Now the part that gives me anxiety, i decided to be patient and wait for me cause I really wanna be with him but sometimes i got frustrated on the situation and thought why weren’t our relationship as normal as others but that’s wasn’t the main issue .
I went to this party and this thing was constantly going in my brain ….” i am single , I am single………” tho i am not even 1% interested in dating anyone but him (my ex boyfriend ) . There was a guy whom I thought was interested in me as i saw him looking at me quite a few times ( could be all in my mind too ) just to find out i started noticing his actions , passing by him noticing his reaction etc etc we didn’t talk , speak nothing at all . 
When i got home as i was about to sleep my anxiety got triggered and it triggered after so long i started feeling guilty , guilty about was i interested in knowing that this person is into me or not , i started feeling anxious and guilty about my actions 
I felt as if i did something wrong with my boyfriend. 
(This party happened after 2 months since our breakup scenario)  
One more thing ( my ex keeps calling me by time to time just to talk normally as we do understand each other pretty well but sometimes i feel so so so guilty talking to him i feel as if i am the worst person ever :)
Since this happened i have been feeling anxious about everything and my every action ."
Anxiety,A classmate made a comment last week,"So last week i had a bit of a breakdown…. Basically i wasnt sleeping and i was just keeping to myself, made the effort to talk only the necessary (still did a presentation in class which i thought i did a good job) and then after finally sleeping again and feeling okayish she kinda made fun of my attitude last week. I was just talking to some classmates and she kinda said something about me having a breakdown last week but in a mocking way. I was able to brush it off and move on with my day but its been bothering me….if she noticed i was going thru something why didnt she approached me and asked me if i was fine. You could tell i was going thru something yet she just assumed im crazy 
Its just kind of a rant because this person has always given me anxiety, idk why, i dont even like her or want to be liked by her but i feel like she is just judging every single thing everyone does."
Anxiety,Battling social anxiety as an adult,"I am 31F, and have had social anxiety since childhood. In recent years I'm actively working on self- care and self worth with professional help and tools like ""inner child work"" which has been amazingly progressive for me. 
     My social anxiety has transitioned from feeling crappy about myself to worrying that people will treat me badly, or over -look my presence or not take me seriously, all of which were previous experiences. 
      I'm still learning to respond to these situations, and struggle to stand up for myself or be assertive or tell people, especially friends, to be more respectful. 
     I have had to let go of a lot of childhood friends who are not able to make that transition and see me for who i am now, their behaviour has not changed, and it makes my anxiety hit the roof. Therapy has helped in letting go of these people who you sometimes build a big part of your life and identity around. 
      Anybody having similar experiences? How do you respond to people in these types of situations?"
Anxiety,Obssess over texts and replies,Idk if this belongs here sorry if it's the wrong sub. So I have a habit that when I get close to someone new I have this need to constantly expect replies from them not every minute but atleast once a day and sometimes it affects me soo much that my mood or the way my day goes depends on their reply. If they take more than a day to reply I also tend to reread messages I've sent to make sure I haven't said anything wrong or pissed them off. I don't expect this of old friends who I'm secure with but when I get close to someone new I'm usually insecure or afraid that they would ghost and weirdly I get that feeling more with men and I often end up having feelings too quick too. I've had this happen soo many times through dating apps etc its a really anxious process for me in the sense that I overthink and obsess a lot.
Anxiety,Social struggles,"So, there's this guy I met when hanging out with my sibling. We've chatted over the last few months, but sometimes I struggle to be social -- just generally. It doesn't get better when he triggers my anxiety, which is something he does quite often. I don't want to be rude about it, but he asks me stuff that I've already beat myself up about and spend plenty time thinking about without his help. Then him reminding me about the things kinda sends me spiraling.

That's probably not his intention, but I don't think he understands how it feels. I'm soon to be 21F, and don't have a license. I've gotten my permit a few times, but don't always have the resources to practice my driving skills. Along with anxiety, it's a difficult thing to do. I've been behind the wheel a few times, but it's always nerve-wracking. If need be, I Uber or ask if someone can pick me up. Worst case scenario, I don't get out.

He also asks me why I don't really have friends, or how long it's been since I hung out with them. I'm hesitant to dive too deep into him with what all went on there. But my last couple friends were pretty toxic. 

I also lost one of my siblings a few months ago, along with my last couple jobs so that's been difficult to navigate -- and makes it harder to work towards things. I've tried therapy, but I shut down and really think I need time to figure myself and all of this out more before I attempt to bring a therapist in again.

I don't mind being alone, or mostly just hanging out with my family -- but it's almost like he views it as an issue. I don't see it that way, but maybe that's because I'm used to being a loner.

Add all that onto a job interview yesterday where I froze up because of anxiety and the manager looked at me like I was an idiot. It was a roleplay scenario with retail credit cards. Raise your hand if you hate this too.

I'm meant to be a stocking position, and only on the floor during opening for a couple hours -- so it wasn't at the front of my mind.

The guy I know does have his nice, goofy, moments. But I'm really struggling.

If I bring up these things to him and tell him it makes me uncomfortable, then he questions it more. The he tries to give me advice like exercising, or otherwise to help with my anxiety. He's probably just trying to help, but... Sometimes I just need to process without the excess input. 

I've had some form of anxiety ever since I was a kid, so I doubt it'll ever truly go away. Is it stupid to wish he'd kind of ask more about me, apart from my mental illness. Or at the very least stop poking the bear?"
Anxiety,I broke up with my girlfriend and now my anxiety is so bad that I can’t get out of bed,"My (17) gf (18) and I had been dating for nearly 4 months, but then all of a sudden I started to lose interest, commitment, and love for her. I was devastated because I still care for her dearly, but I could tell that my heart wasn’t 100% in it and it wasn’t fair to her. So, last night I broke up with her. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. She kept asking me why, saying she was confused, asking what she did wrong, and I had no answer, because even I didn’t know what happened, all Ik is that something shifted. She is in a really really bad place right now. I woke up to her drunk texting me at 3 in the morning, telling me she cried so hard that she puked, and that she’s scared and doesn’t know what to do. I coudkbt stop crying last night because I felt so bad about hurting her and ending things, and now I’m laying in bed, shaking, unable to get up. Idk what to do. I’m scared too. Someone please help"
Anxiety,Eye Doctor Appointment- terrified,"Hello!

I have an eye doctor appointment in an hour for pain in my eyes, and I know I will need to have my eyes dilated. 
I have a huge fear of dilated pupils. 
I hate the idea of not being able to see from dilation so much I feel like I’ll have a panic attack at the optometrist. 
Any advice, tips or similar experiences?"
Anxiety,Can frequent headaches be a symptom of stress and anxiety?,"I’m planning on getting it checked out, but for the past month my anxiety has been through the roof, for seemingly no cause. Well, aside from school. I’ve been getting hit by random waves of anxiety and coincidentally - frequent headaches. I’m taking at least 3 pills per day to deal with the pain and this is highly unusual for me. I’m a person who never gets headaches, unless my bodily needs are severely neglected. I’ll have an occasional headache, but nothing of this degree. So I’ve been wondering if there is perhaps a correlation between these two."
Anxiety,I made a tik tok about panic attacks,[removed]
Anxiety,I should have left but I was a coward,"Hey guys, I'm not sure it's anxiety or it's just me but I lately figured out that I have never been the one who leaves, I'm always the one who stays. A little history about me🙂 years ago I get accepted into my dream college but I never went because it was far from home and my family convinced me at the time to stay and go to a nearby college I DID. Then I went to study something I didn't want because it was more reasonable and easier to get a job in that field and I DID. I get a great job offer in a different city instead I started to work from home with less money to help around and I DID... AND NOW I think I only stayed out of fear not because I was a good daughter or because I wanted to. I was simply too anxious to leave and too scared to admit it even to myself. I'm not sure if it's helpful but I hope if you someone with anxiety or depression PLEASE leave when you can it only get harder.

P.s sorry if my English isn't perfect, it's not my first language 👀"
Anxiety,"Hand on the Banister: The ""Do Nothing"" response to fight or flight","I've found this to be the most effective way to handle a panic attack, or any anxiety situation, during its peak.  


I'll highlight the practical technique in **bold**, but it's super important to understand the theory behind it as well. Not just to understand it, but to look at what's going on from this perspective.   


If you have any kind of anxiety disorder, you've certainly come across similar techniques before. But if you're anything like me, sometimes it takes hearing about the same thing from tons of different perspectives to make it click.   


Plus, I think there's huge potential to apply this in a much wider scope - done widely and consistently, it can permanently reveal core elements of your ego (false identity) to the point where it can no longer fool you into being locked inside a narrow, fear based perspective. Feels like ego death. Sounds intense, but uh, that's what I found. It's trippy and good to do.  


Anyway, the ""Do Nothing"" response to fight or flight:  


Anxiety relies on two main elements to sustain itself: the feelings (the adrenaline / fear) and the mental narrative around it.   


Sometimes it's obvious which one pops up first, sometimes is a chicken-and-the-egg thing. Doesn't matter for this purpose. When there are intense feelings of fear, your mind is doing more than just ""looking for a reason for the fear"". It's also using the fear to build a narrative - it incorporates that narrative into its conception of who you are.   


Your self image becomes one of ""I'm a person suffering from a panic attack!"" or ""Why is this happening to me?"" or ""I've got to overcome this."" There is a certain compelling quality to all of these - they portray you as an innocent victim to which a terrible thing is happening. And that may be true - but that's not the point.   


The point is that there \*will\* be some part of you, some part of your brain, that will want to resist the ""do nothing"" technique because it is getting some hit of pleasure from the moral innocence that these narratives provide. This isn't a judgement, it's the way our brains work, and it's the thing we're trying to stop (along with the ""looking for a reason for the fear).  


**So, the technique:**  


**When the panic hits, you want to stay with the feelings themselves, and \*as best you can\*, resist the urge to narrativize.**  


**You don't need to intensely feel the feelings - think of it as lightly holding onto a handrail/banister while going down the stairs. Keep some attention on it, and when your thoughts start to panic (and especially when they start to create an image of you as someone who is panicking), gently put your attention back on the feelings.**   


**Stay with them until a shift happens - until you no longer feel an urge to craft a mental narrative around them.**  


What this does is severs the feeling element of anxiety from the narrative element. This, firstly, has the effect of activating your ""rest and digest"" response, which should significantly cut down the length of the panic attack. The feelings will still be incredibly uncomfortable, but they can just kind of sit there, and lessen, and pass.   


But, it also has a much more permanent effect:  


When the urge to narrativize dies down, you're proving to your mind that it's not necessary. It becomes far easier to disengage from it the next time, and the next time, until it's second nature.  


Also, you start seeing your panic from a different perspective. When not narrativizing, you can look at the compulsion to do so much more clearly. You can see how there are core parts of your identity which have, against your will, developed around the addictive quality of the narrative, and which have constricted your perspective through fear.   


It's like widening your perspective beyond the one defined by your ego. There will start to be some peace around the whole thing, even in the middle of the storm. You'll be able to bear the feelings much better, and let them hit you with its full force, without reacting or getting sucked into that fear based perspective. It's a rush.  


If you do this with other triggers of the fight or flight response, especially arguments, or anything that threatens core beliefs or elements of your identity, this expansion of perspective can become permanent. You'll become far less shaken by people giving you crap, essentially. But that's later. Right now, try it with the panic. Stay with the feelings, and as best as possible resist the urge to create a narrative or self image around it.  


Fight or flight is never a binary choice. It's always ""fight or flight or do nothing"". Give it a shot, and please let me know how it works.  


\*All credit for this perspective goes to a friend. I can just share my personal experiences with it, and how it helped me."
Anxiety,How to deal with yourself?,"So everyday I try to be happy and calm but it’s hard besides I got a crazy situation and sux I got anxiety disorder, I’m too self aware of my heart I think when I stand up my heart beats faster than it should part of it has to do with my addictive personality maybe I mean I feel like everyday I’m trying to feed an empty void and trying hard to calm my heart before a seizure or cardiac arrest happens it seems inhuman how fast my heart goes up it’s maybe happened before almost 200bpm it scares me tho and turns into a more anxiety cycle I game to try to distract myself tbh and i use to love drinking so my mind is still struggling I found new obsessions….."
Anxiety,has anyone else experienced this ???,"so a couple of months ago usually at night time i get this feeling like bugs were on me and kept flying into me, but there never actually seemed to be any when i would go to turn the lights on, i started waking from dreams where the same would happen, i guess i just forgot that this used to happen until recently it’s started happening again where i really feel/hear bugs flying at me and like i said i might even wake up from my sleep thinking they’re on me, has anyone else had this ?"
Anxiety,How do folks with social anxiety initiate making friendships?,"I am not great at initiating friendships or being vulnerable with people. I can be open and emotional but it takes me a very long time to trust people enough to do that. I had a lot of bullying experiences in the past from friends and I think I've kind of internalized it into my anxiety and trust issues. I have cordial relationships with people and get along, but we don't talk more deeply than just surface things and hellos.
I just moved for grad school in August and I still don't feel like I've found anyone I'm close to here. I have a partner (who I met online, there's no way in hell I could have met him in person) who is the person I currently confide in the most, I love him lots, but even so it's fairly new, and I still know I want/need friends outside of a romantic relationship as well. I don't want to just make friends through him either because last time I dated someone I did that and... now those friends are gone. 
I know people say joining groups helps, but with covid it's been hard to find them, and most organizations you have to pay to join and I'm a very broke grad student. I try to sign up for volunteer orgs but everything is still virtual here for the ones I'm in and I can't meet anyone. 
I'm just really lonely, but I can't bring myself to text work/school colleagues because I'm scared they'll think I'm weird contacting them about not school or work, that they'll say no, or that they'll say yes and it will be awkward and I'll never have a good relationship with them again... It's just hard to bridge that gap and make real friends, like people I emotionally connect with or who I can talk to when I have a hard time or share stupid jokes with. I want that so bad, but it scares the shit out of me that I'll try to initiate and I'll somehow be doing something horribly wrong by even suggesting it. I always suggest study groups because it makes it feel more professional and less scary for me, but now that I'm just doing my thesis and no courses that isn't really an option anymore. And even when I do invite people to things, I never know how much to open up and share, i struggle to be vulnerable and warm which I think makes people not like me because I come off as boring or cold.

Does anyone with social anxiety have tips on how to initiate making friends and get over being so so afraid of it? I just don't want to be lonely anymore, but I get these awful feelings in my gut when I think of asking people to hang out and always imagine the absolute worst case scenarios. I want friends here because I know I'll be happier, but I don't know how to get to that point."
Anxiety,"my teachers know I'm suicidal, afraid to show up","I missed the last 2+ weeks (2 classes on Tues/Thurs) of college mostly due to crippling anxiety and depression. I lost my glasses, my phone service plan just ended, i dont have a car.. 

My teachers reached out via text asking if I was ok, and they seem to actually care about me. I was drunk and admitted that id been feeling suicidal / been. sick from overdosing  ...which was super dumb ik..  they had the school therapist called me and i pretend im fine.

I haven't been to class sine then. Im failing one of the classes and have a B+ in the other. I'm just scared to face my teachers for some reason, i usually don't get embarrassed but i am for admitting all this to them. Im also relatively extroverted and am talkative in one of the classes that engages in group activities. So it would be weird to suddenly be quiet or do I pretend like nothing even happened. What would you do?"
Anxiety,Body Tension,"I’ve always had problem with unconscious tensing of my muscles. I do it with my legs, but most noticeably in my neck and shoulders (most noticeable because it is causing pain). I have to tell myself to relax all day. 

I realize that I’m probably internalizing my stress, but the thing is I don’t really have many stressors in my life. Since I was very young my shoulders have always been wrapped around my ears. It was never a big deal before but now it’s causing my mind to get anxious. 

Does anyone have tips on how to just relax? I meditate daily, I’ve gotten massages, and have used about every self help product out there (or at least it seems like it). 

Any advice is much appreciated. I’m at my wits end. I just want to relax!"
Anxiety,Some advice?,Due to my bad anxiety lately I have not been eating much. I would usually eat something in the afternoon or I would wait until my fiancé would come home from work and then eat. I feel like not eating is affecting me more as I keep having a headache and just no energy. At the same time I am anxious to eat for some reason. Anyone else was like this? Any tips?
Anxiety,"Just when I feel like I have my shit together, my cringey-ass will get flustered at work meetings and make everyone uncomfortable with my awkwardness","I embarrassed myself during a stupid icebreaker game in front of my entire organization. Imagine someone who is blatantly nervous and awkward, and has to present, and you just feel so bad for them and need to look away because of the cringe....that awkward person was me at the meeting.

I hate myself at the moment. I can't face my coworkers. Will this feeling subside?"
Anxiety,This is giving me bad anxiety,Last night I was in bed around 10pm watching videos. One of the videos I was watching I accidentally pressed this tv icon for this thing called airplay and it showed all the tv’s in my house. I don’t think I pressed one of them but I what if I did? Would the video I was watching in my phone (not a video I would want my parents to know I was watching) go right to the tv or would there be a code and other steps to follow? I know for a fact that my parents and siblings were watching the in their rooms at the time because I walked past them to get a drink of water. As of this morning they haven’t asked me about it. I don’t think I tapped any of the tv’s and the video just stayed on phone. Either way Im pretty sure I closed the tab immediately.
Anxiety,Crippling fear of getting blood drawn- panic attack and melt down,"I'm a 23 year old girl and I still can't get my blood drawn without freaking out. The weird thing is shots don't bother me, just getting blood drawn. I hate having to extend my arm and how long the process can be. It's so embarrassing but I freak out and cry every time. I want to get over this so bad but it feels impossible. I was always afraid of blood and get dizzy whenever certain subjects are brought up about blood or the human body. In health class I would always have to leave the room. I can't live like this and I need to get over it."
Anxiety,One Thing After Another…,"I am new to this thread and even the idea of talking about my anxiety. I’ve struggled since I was a child with anxiety and have never learned healthy ways to cope. I’m 26 now but I feel like my ability to adapt and overcome with life’s rollercoaster turns is becoming less and less. The smallest issue will send me into a vicious downward spiral of anxiety attacks and fallacious beliefs. It could be anything from money troubles, family problems, to someone didn’t say hello when I greeted them. It makes me feel out of control and concerned for the future. I’m married to an awesome wife who has been supportive the best she can at times but I feel bad that I drag her through my minds hell everyday. She deserves someone to be happy with and not someone who has the waterworks ready at any moment. I’m curious to know if anyone else feels this way? Does it get better with time? I’m working up the courage to see a professional and waiting for new healthcare to kick in. Any tips, insights, guidance or reading recommendations are greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,"Left arm pain, and having a rough anxiety day. I could really use some reassurance.","I’m 22(f), and have been diagnosed with GAD, PD, OCD, and Agoraphobia. I have a lot of health anxiety, and I have for years. I got a random pain while not doing anything today. It’s been going on for about 30 minutes. A heat-like tension/numbness in my left shoulder and arm. I don’t have any known illnesses, and my heart rate is stable and currently 84 BPM. I’ve felt no skipped beats or anything. But I’m still here panicking that this is a heart attack. The more I think about it, the stranger my breathing feels. The more sensations I feel in my chest. I really could use some reassurance today."
Anxiety,Is anyone else annoyed that they have to choose between feeling anxious all the time or being hazy-minded from anti-anxiety meds?,I know not all anti-anxiety meds cause drowsiness and head fog but those either kill my sex life or cause me even more anxiety ironically. Writing this while half asleep and debating on drinking more coffee to wake up or to continue feeling calm.
Anxiety,Not Comfort-Drinking The Coffee,"Had a robo call that sounds just like one of my abusive exes, found out Samsung voicemail deleted my only two saved messages, and am soooooo fucking tired from insomnia and emotionally overwhelming things. Good morning!

I have to drive out soon for class. I've been trying to curb ~☆luxury☆~ spending. Fancy coffee helps me not feel like I'm gonna pass out at the wheel and pushes class into the threshold of bearable and even mildly enjoyable.

But the gogo juice hurts my wallet and is like speed for my anxiety dissociation issues. And I am hypersensitive to caffeine so it will keep me up til the wee hours.

I am not going to get the gogo juice today."
Anxiety,Mistakes at work,"This may be a bit of a read. I understand if people dont want to take the time to read my sob story 😕
A throwaway account because I already have anxiety posting about my job in fear that a coworker may see it (but I doubt it).

I work as a zookeeper at a small zoo and I have incredible anxiety whenever I'm at work. This is my first job in this field, and I didn't finish college so this job is pretty much my foot in the door for a career in this field. I've kept animals for most of my life, and already had experience with a lot of the things we do at the zoo which is why I was hired without a degree.

Because of this, I have a horrible anxiety about messing up in ANY degree. I am horrified at the thought of messing up, losing my job, and failing at yet another shot at life. Today my boss texted me and told me that I had forgotten to water a bin with 2 froglets in it yesterday, and as a result the froglets were found dead today. At first, I wonder if I'll be fired for the mistake (although mistakes are typically taken with a grain of salt as long as it's not a HUGE mistake. I've never seen someone fired over making a mistake), then I begin to wonder what my boss and my co workers must think of me. I tell myself they think I'm stupid, air headed, and I definitely believe I am the dumbest employee there.

I've been there for a year now and every time I think I've got the job down to a science or routine, something happens or I'm tasked with something new and I end up messing it up (and in this case my mess up resulted in the loss of 2 lives. Even though they were ""just froglets"" as my friends have said trying to make me feel better I don't undermine their life at all). I'm constantly worried about failing, and being seen as a failure or not good enough. Im typically a very outgoing and funny person but at work im kinda quiet because i even worry about saying the wrong thing, or saying something that would make me seem dumb. I'm already seeing a therapist but I wanted to hear what some of you might have to say.

How do I address mistakes without getting so anxious I feel sick? How do i stop myself from jumping to the conclusion that i would be fired from a job i love very much just from the drop of a hat? I feel like it would almost be wrong of me not to beat myself up over a mistake. I've even been told by a co worker that I seem to be very hard on myself, but if I'm not then I feel I will just be more likely to fail. I have a good work environment, I enjoy my job and working with the people I work with. How do I get over this feeling that I'm an idiot who can't get anything right? Everytime I begin to get a little bit of confidence in myself at work I mess something up and end up right back here. I feel like I'm being punished by life for NOT being overly anxious and hard on myself.

I appreciate it if you read all that. It was a lot. I don't expect anyone here to have ""the answers"" just some advice to guide me towards them."
Anxiety,Anxiety symptoms or something way more serious? Please help 🙏,"20 years old/MALE, pretty physically active, never smoked/used alcohol or drugs and slim body shape.

I've been dealing with some pretty frightening symptoms for almost 3 months now, like chest pain (on the left side), difficulty breathing (especially when lying down and it's more noticeable at night while being alot less noticable in the morning) and weird undescribable feelings in my chest. Always has me feeling like I'm dying😅

I did an echocardiogram test as well as an x-ray around 2 months ago and everything turned out just fine, only got some magnesium to calm me down (which isn't helping much). I've only had amenia when it comes to medical history but that was a really long time ago (when I was around 13-15yrs old)

So is this really just anxiety (I have pretty intense health anxiety with awful self check habits) or is it actually something more dangerous (like heart disease etc)

Help would be very appreciated please 🙏"
Anxiety,Have You Been Misdiagnosed as Psychotic?,"Before I realized I had gone through an episode GAD w/physical symptoms I was thrown into a box as psychotic, coerced and gaslit for months into thinking I was delusional and irrational. 

Thankfully I refused antipsychotic meds but my Anxiety still lingers, I don’t know if Meds are the answer, benzodiazepines are no joke and I want no part of that addiction."
Anxiety,My own breathing makes me anxious,"The past few years I think I seriously messed my breathing. I think im breathing far to heavily and it has gotten eratic or ""stuttery"" sounding. Im worried the uneveness of my breath and how loud it is make it sound like im constantly saying words under my breath. It gets worse around people and I end up feeling like people think im dangerous and scary even though im gentle kind person. How do I get comfortable breathing and not feel like its the end of the world when I stand too close to someone. My fear gets worse in total silence or when I cant hear my breath"
Anxiety,Does your period make anxiety worse?,"I’ve been on lexapro for almost 7 weeks and still struggling with anxiety off and on. But I think I’ve noticed the week before and the week during my period, my anxiety flares up again. Anyone have similar experience?"
Anxiety,I don’t really know who to talk to about my problems,"So I suffer from pretty bad morning anxiety. I will go on the bus and have a random panic attack. It’s been happening so often to me this year and I am not even sure why. I am not really nervous of anything, but yet I still get that anxiety pain? I have had to literally walk around the school just to calm myself down, and I am not even sure what to do or who to talk to. I want to talk to people about it, but from my previous experience, people just like to make formulated assumptions about my anxiety. Just because I have anxiety, does not mean I am awkward or not social, but people don’t really recognize that, and I feel degraded and demeaned everytime I talk to people about it. I would be fine talking about it if there weren’t so many mislabels around the term. I don’t know what to do.."
Anxiety,Anyone else having a crappy day?,"My day itself is fine, but mentally I feel like trash. I'm super anxious and feel like everyone is mad at me...and I have no reason to feel like this. I hate it.

Anxiety,"Redbull, coffee vs pre workouts","Hi, I used to drink 3-4 cups of home made coffee every day + take around 200-300mg of caffeine most days through a preworkout I took for gym. I've been feeling hella on edge, paranoid and very shaky for sometime already but never really tried to fix it until the end of December where I cut coffee off entirely and haven't had a cup since. I had 1 redbull about 30 days in which ruined my sleep and I had the worst sleep since quitting coffee by far(I normally fall asleep within 5min and sleep through the entire night, unless I wake up to pee after which I normally immediately fall back asleep. 

2 weeks back a game released that I've been waiting for for 4 years so naturally I took time off work and spent 60/72h playing it. Dropped my diet entirely and ate burgers and pizzas and drank 4 red bulls per day for 4 days at that point while gaming. I resumed the diet and workouts and got wasted a few days back and had another 2 red bulls. Shakiness, paranoia, that heavy feeling like I'm about to pass out in my chest(if that even makes sense lol), breathing trouble are all back. 


Now what I wanna note here is that I've been(apart from these 2 failures) been following a very healthy 4k/day diet where I workout 5~x per week and am making very good progress. My sleep has been flawless and my anxiety was basically reduced to minimal where I haven't had a single occasion dealing with any sort of chest tension, breathing issues etc. What's weird in this is that even when I don't drink coffee or red bulls, I still drink 300mg of caffeine 2 days in a row, none on the 3rd day as it's a rest from gym day and then 2 days in a row again and repeat but the caffeine in preworkout doesn't seem to have any of the negative side effects I seem to get from red bull for example. 


Does anyone have any info on this? How come a red bull, and I assume coffee would too cause such severe side effects and the preworkout caffeine doesn't? Just got me really curious lol"
Anxiety,Would Anyone Be Down To Create A Zoom Support Group For Anxiety And Depression Sufferers?,"Since therapy can be really expensive, and no one really understands mental illness but the people who suffer from them I was thinking that creating a zoom group that meets at least 2-3 times a week would be a cool idea for this sub."
Anxiety,I need tips and tricks!,"What is the best way to handle test anxiety?

I have always done very well in school but since being in college, I have put WAY more pressure on myself than I probably need to. With that being said, no matter how much I study and prepare for a test, my anxiety SKY ROCKETS. This only gets worse when it's actually time to take the test, I stress about timing, how nervous I'm feeling, and ALWAYS second guess myself. Does anyone deal with this also? do you have any tricks that help you with this?"
Anxiety,Any tips on how to stay asleep longer ?,"I can fall asleep without problem, and I stay asleep. But only for 5-6 hours and once I'm awake and the adrenaline rushes I can't fall asleep again. 

Any suggestions?"
Anxiety,What is a panic attack? Did I have one?,"Hi guys. It's my first post here so I hope this is an appropriate topic. I guess you guys would know more about this topic and google doesn't help, so I was looking for advice.

I've been having these scary episodes about twice a month or so, beginning last year. My symptoms during these episodes are basically heart palpitations (fast, pounding heartbeat that doesn't calm down no matter what), heart flutters, and body jolts (I'm zapped awake by what feels like a rush of adrenaline while trying to sleep during an episode.) 

These episodes last for hours, and one felt like it kept going for two days. I almost called 911. 

I feel paranoid that I'll have a heart attack and die, or that my heart is atrophying slowly and it's compensating and I'll die in the next year. I try to calm myself down, distract myself, pray, etc but it doesn't seem to work until my heart decides to chill out hours later.

The thing is, I'm hesitant to say it's a heart condition because I just turned 21, and I'm a healthy weight and good blood pressure and all. I'm also hesitant to call it anxiety because I don't show many of the social symptoms like worrying, low self esteem, or avoiding confrontation. I'm pretty confident in myself and my ability. The only thing I'm not confident in is, well, my heart health because of these episodes I get.

I guess my question is, can someone start having physical panic attacks without the mental anxiety symptoms? And should I take any actions about this?

*I will add, I'm an engineering student and I put myself through a lot of stress due to workload and lack of sleep. But I feel overall happy and am able to have some free time still."
Anxiety,My body experiences anxiety even if I’m not nervous,"I don’t know if this makes sense but let’s say I have to do something and I’ve done it a few times and im no longer nervous to do it, my body still gets nervous. So for example I had a meeting with my mentor and I already hyped myself up and mentally I wasn’t nervous because we have talked before. But right when I entered the meeting my body starts to shake a lot, my heart in my stomach, I stutter, feeling chills, and can’t find the words I need to say. So then I start to get nervous because I look dumb. It’s like a circle of my body gets nervous so I get nervous of how I look and that makes me more nervous all together. Sorry if I seem all over the place I just wanted to get that out because it’s so annoying. Idk if I’m nervous but I think I’m not idk"
Anxiety,Why does something I have to do to make a living give me so much anxiety?,"I’ll start by saying I know I shouldn’t be so anxious about this and it’s something everyone has to do but I just can’t stop worrying. 

I’m going back to work tomorrow. Luckily it’s just part time only 4 days a week, and it’s at a place I work previously. It’s been 2 years since I last worked there so I don’t know how things have changed. Maybe they completely changed the way they do things and I’ll mess everything thing up. Or maybe I won’t be able to relearn anything. 

I feel like I’m mostly worried because of my last job and just how toxic the owner was. Nothing was ever good enough for him and he just always found something to criticize no matter how small and insignificant it was. He had no idea what he wanted so he blamed everything on his workers. 

And it’s only a temporary job for 8 weeks or so while I cover for someone on medical leave so even if I do mess everything up it’s not like it was meant to be permanent anyways. I know I’m probably gonna do fine back at work and feel dumb for thinking this after but I just have this feeling in the pit of my stomach."
Anxiety,This has helped me with anxiety and to let go,[removed]
Anxiety,Anyone Else Worry/Have Anxiety About Dumb Things?,"I'm on the Autism Spectrum (Aspergers) and with that came anxiety. I take prescription medication for it, so it's manageable, but I'm angry and aggravated that I get anxious about things most people likely wouldn't. Here are some major examples:

Just today, I DM'd a YouTuber I recently discovered and like, saying how I like their videos and giving my personal thoughts on one of them. It was all very innocent, but now I'm worried they're going to think I'm weird for direct messaging rather than just tweeting at them.

I think I'm overly-concerned with what people online think about me and my opinions. It doesn't help that I have some unpopular opinions in some of the fandoms and communities I'm part of, and sometimes I just feel like an outcast or something. Don't know if that counts as anxiety or not but I figured I'd mention it.

I'm anxious about driving, but I'm getting lessons to build up my confidence.

If there are any more I can remember and want to talk about, I'll add them. I'm honestly also nervous posting my private issues for everyone to see, but I think it'll be healthy to just get it all out there and, more importantly, in front of a group of people who might understand me. So, yeah, here goes nothing lol."
Anxiety,Dealing with Anxiety is just as awful as any other disease,"I came into this world screaming and I have not stopped. I have battled anxiety since my earliest memory, my childhood was filled with trauma and pain. As an adult it has gotten 100 times worse, and even in 2022 mental health issues are disregarded and dismissed by so many, even in the medical world. 
I get so angry by the notion of “well you don’t look sick, so snap out of it” and the cost of mental health care is so expensive and/or non existent where I live. Even with health insurance I, and thousands more, are punished for having anxiety and the fact of the state taking away the medication that I have had to take for years. Fuck it.
I am so tired but can’t sleep. I just want it to stop. I dread waking up every day and have bad thoughts about making that happen. 
Anxiety and depression are slowly killing me, one way or another."
Anxiety,I really need advice,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for over 10 years. I remember being 12 and going to the doctor because I had an anxiety attack. A lot of things that happened in my life have made it significantly worse (shitty friends, toxic relationships, etc). Now, I can barely be In ANY social setting without being fillies with anxiety, which the makes me hands sweat EXCESSIVELY, which makes my body start to sweat, then My cloths start to smell,  which causes me to feel even more anxious because I’m fully aware of all this happening. I can barely meet any body because usually the first greeting is awkward because I either shook their hand with hands more wet than the ocean and I have to explain why I don’t want to shake their hand. I’ve been seeing a therapist and it’s the same “just try and not to think about the things, seeming confirmation of my thoughts” and stuff like that. IVE TRIED. IT DOESNT WORK. I CANT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT MY CHEST FEELING LIKES ITS BEING CONSTRICTED. it’s literally destroying my life. I sometimes don’t even go to class because I’m so fucking nervous to just look or smell bad. It’s hard to pay attention due to the same reasons. Meeting new people is damn near a dead mission. It literally takes 1 millisecond for me to go from fine to anxiety overload. What’s wrong with me? Do I need actual medical attention? How do people overcome constant social anxiety"
Anxiety,I've been having INSANE anxiety,To the point where i sometimes experience tremor or my phone changes expression to complete shock rven after hearing good news. I got a job offer today and my friends who were on the table with me told me they thought someone i knew died because of the way i carried the conversation. Im getting a job overseas and i feel bad for leaving my circle of friends and family. The reasons are so stupid but they have a very big effect on me.
Anxiety,Traveling as a recently diagnosed anxious person,"I’ve always had a very anxious personality but didn’t really have my first panic attack until a week ago. Well, I’ve had them but usually under the influence of something I.e. drugs, alcohol, caffeine. This really triggered my anxiety and I haven’t felt peace since. I manage to get a hold of a psychiatrist and I’ve been on buspirone (15g total per day) for 4 days now. I’m not sure if it’s in my head or my meds but I’m an anxious mess and I feel hyperactive and constantly over stimulated. 

I have a trip to Cancun in two days. It’s supposed to be relaxing (no partying, just lounging and exploring) but my brain is absolutely fucked right now. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea. Canceling everything will also be a stress of it’s own. But I’m scared of the airport, I’m scared of the plane idk if I can handle being in a enclosed space with that many people for that long. I’m scared to be in another country while in this state. My friend is also highly dependent on me because she’s never been international so I’d have to take care of her. I spoke with my doctor and he prescribed a few pills of Ativan just to get me through my trip. 

I just feel really uneasy. All these emotions and meds are so new to me. People are telling me perhaps I need this vacation. Is it a good idea? Has anyone ever mixed Ativan with buspirone?"
Anxiety,Starting Xanax," Just got out of a doctor's appointment and I have been prescribed Alprazolam , which reading online I found to be pretty much Xanax. During my reading, I found out it's kinda scary with all the withdrawal symptoms and the chance of death. I have been prescribed 0.25 mg of it at breakfast, dinner and one as SOS. This is my 2nd time taking medication, and I'm taking it with antidepressants, and I just wished to know of you guys have any recommendations or warnings. Scary stuff."
Anxiety,"Work, emails, and unavailability to get things done","The first time I realized this was in Highschool. I knew things had to get done, a reading list, essays, and knowledge stuck in my head that I couldn't put to work.

Now almost 10 years later, at work,  I know the process and how to get things done, but I just can't get myself to do it. I feel paralyzed and the lack of motivation stalling my every move. I know it is not quite anxiety, but that comes after. Depression gets to me first, the feeling that I'm not good enough, or that I may do or say the wrong thing. That I will get in trouble for not following the process, even though things can get fixed. The thoughts that win are telling me that I cannot keep going, and the anxiety that I can't shake off because I can't get things done, I'm afraid of being called out and that makes me depressed because I'm anxious of the day I lose my job because I cannot get things done.... And the cycle keeps going. 

Some days are better than others, some days I work diligently, I clear my inbox and all is good with the world. But I cannot keep it up and I don't know why or how."
Anxiety,Can someone Answer?,I can feel my heartbeat everywhere in the body. Even in my feet all the time. Once i sleep it disappears. As soon as i am awake same sensations again. I did cardiac check up. Everything was normal. Whenver i am busy i don't give much attention to these symptoms. But whenever i go to relax can't ignore them. Can these be the signs of Anxiety. Does anyone else have these symptoms? Having these foe last 10 years.
Anxiety,Had the worst anxiety going back to office yesteeday. Am I anxious enough to go to a doctor for anxiety medication?,"I am a 25F who is working from home for a big tech company as a software developer. I've always had anxiety growing up and through college. Mostly from self doubt, negative self talk and overthinking. I am Asian and my mom has always been very harsh and cruel with me verbally and sometimes physically. Making me believe I'm never gonna be good enough. 

Anyways I graduated from University in 2018 and ever since I started working a corporate job, the workload, imposter syndrome and lack of confidence made my anxiety skyrocket. I started to struggle with falling asleep. The longer I stay up, the more depressing thoughts I have in my head. In 2021, with covid and work getting more and more intense, I decided to take edibles and it greatly helped me relax in the evening.

Yesterday, I had to go into the office after working from home for two years because my manager wanted everyone to meet in person and ""bond"". I didn't feel anxious about it the night before, maybe because of weed. But when I arrived and met everyone, I just felt so nervous all of a sudden. Having to fake smile so much, socialize and small talk. Compared to the typical zoom meetings where I have my video off most of the time, every movement and sound I make can be seen and heard by everyone. The day was full of meetings where I felt frozen all day, followed by a happy hour. 

The whole time I was at the office, I pretended to be normal and all, smiling and talking to people, but my breathing was super shallow the whole time. it was almost as if I had forgotten how to breathe properly. My shoulders were high up because my body was tense. I drank two cups of iced coffee to survive the day but it made my heartrate go up I believe. I was feeling more nervous as the day went on. I didn't drink any water so I was dehydrated. I was constantly worried about saying something bad that people might judge me about. Around the end of the day, I got a really really bad headache. The right side of my head was throbbing and it was painful. I had to heas home. I was so tense all day that I think it caused a migraine. When I got home, I went straight to bed unable to think well, still feeling very anxious about the social interactions I had to have all day. I took Advils immediately and edibles to relax. I cried a little because I hated myself for being so anxious. 

Then I thought to myself, maybe I want to get medication for anxiety. because edibles are too strong to take before work. I think Xanax and such would help reduce my anxiety throughout the day. but I have Always been scared of getting such medicines because what if I get addicted and dependent. Also, I am not sure if my anxiety is ""bad enough"" to be prescribed medications for my symptoms."
Anxiety,"I got dumped by my ex-girlfriend, my existing anxiety has blown up.","I don't know where to start, but it's best to start at the beginning, she and i were quite a unique couple and i knew from the moment i met her that she'd be ""The one"", and as cliche as it sounds, it was true. Things got real rough when we were in a long distance relationship but we really tried our best, then COVID hit and that's where our downfall began. Fast forward two years into the pandemic and she couldn't handle the pain and she made the call to end things, and i absolutely respect her for it. But the reason I've come here to pour whatever I'm going through is because of my anxiety. For years i just assumed i think alot and I'm easily anxious about little things, i thought that maybe it was something everyone feels, and maybe everyone does feel like this, but after the break up my heart has been undeniably put under alot of stress because of my anxiety, I'd usually have her to talk about it and she'd calm me down but now i have a few friends who don't really understand it, and i don't blame them. So I've resorted in talking about it to my now ex girlfriend (sad face). The anxiety just comes out of nowhere. I'd usually use my art to control it and obviously music to help me out but recently I've been zoning out and distracted by the thoughts in my head. Sometimes I'd feel like every wall around me just starts to cave in and i have no room to breathe. It's been happening quite often these past few months. I genuinely wish I'd know how to control it because this is unfortunately been a part of me and i need to live with it. Idk if the context i typed is an relevant but i hope someone out here could relate."
Anxiety,Stress Paralysis?,"I remember a situation a few months ago where I was experiencing a ton a stress. I was sitting on my couch looking at my phone when suddenly I just stopped moving completely.

My phone slipped out of my hands and my body was transfixed in the same posture for what felt like a long, long time. After mustering enough willpower, I would move one finger and eventually get my hand to move. A hand would turn into an arm, then shoulders then chest. Eventually after consciously working my way up and down my body, I was able to move again. 

This phenomena only happens to me under circumstances of severe stress and uncertainty. 

Has anyone else had this experience? The closest thing I've found to this is catatonia but catonic people cab remain transfixed for hours or even days. I was stuck for a bit, but I'm sure it was less than 15 minutes."

Anxiety,This may help people with heart anxiety.,"Due to having covid I got my hands on a pulse oximeter just so I can monitor my oxygen levels and stuff. And while using it I noticed that my heart rate would fluctuate up and down by around 6-8 bpm or so. So obviously I looked up ""fluctuating heart rate"" on google and as expected it only showed worse case scenario illnesses which put me into a panic attack.

After doing more research and monitoring my heart rate I found out that what was actually happening was called sinus arrhythmia and is completely normal. Basically as you breathe in your heart rate slightly increases and as you breathe out it slightly decreases.

I dont know what is a treasure that breaks when you open it or whatever the horribly difficult riddle question is. I keep telling myself im not dumb, but when it comes to trivia I literally don't know shit. At my workplace they're planning a trivia game and I'm freaking out."
Anxiety,I’m so alone,"I’m a college freshman who’s living away from home. I don’t have many friends and I feel constantly uncomfortable around other people. It’s gotten to a point where I’ll just leave in the middle of a class to try and not throw up because of how bad my anxiety has gotten. I live with one other person and I can’t stand it. I’ll lock myself in the bathroom just so I can avoid being in the same room with the guy. I’ve been to therapy a couple of times over the years, but it’s been like 2 months since my last session. I really liked going to therapy, but I don’t want to bother my parents to have them worry about me or pay for my medical expenses. 

I’ve had days where I’ll be in bed and realize that I’ve literally haven’t spoken to anyone. I’m so alone. I just want someone to hold me. I want to cry and just tell someone everything that’s been bothering me. I don’t think I can live like this any longer."
Anxiety,Having intrusive thoughts again in class (TW),"I feel like a horrible person. 


Some person kept clicking their pen in class today - and they are literally so kind. They remembered my name after like one class. But all I could think about was how I hoped they had sex with their bf and end up choking on his cum and dying and wtf. I don't know anything about this person, much less if they even have a bf. 

I hate this. I hate myself. I feel so disgusting. I hate that that's the first thing that came out my mind and I keep worrying that maybe I'm aroused by it and I just want to fucking die."
Anxiety,Best remedies/tips for side effects?,I just started Cymbalta (SNRI) last Wednesday and have had a really nasty headache on Saturday and Monday. Also have been waking up randomly at 2:30/3am. How do you alleviate these side effects? I know I have to ride it out but some advice to make it bearable would be greatly appreciated 🥰
Anxiety,Comforting to know I can end it?,"I got medication I'm on increased recently to a higher dose in a slow release pill instead of several small doses as needed. Dr told me not to mix the new dose pills with high dose ones, then glanced at the computer then at me and said absolutely do not take them together it's too much. He said it about 4 times wonder what was on that screen that he felt he had to do that.

So anyway I was reading the leaflet after I got the prescription and it mentioned how toxic the med is in overdose.

Is it bad that I find it comforting?"
Anxiety,Does anyone get a burning/pins and needles sensation on their upper left arm that extends to your finger tips?,"I sometimes randomly get a burning sensation on my left arm as if I just got an Indian burn or like it’s losing sensation. I’m definitely stressed out right now but not having a panic attack or anything. However, the feeling I have in my arm is a little scary. Is this normal for anyone else?"
Anxiety,"Confidence shattered , anxiety back","17M , Things had finally started to go well, I found a good friend group over the holiday and I was doing things out of my comfort zone and I tried new things like starting boxing, looking for a new job and getting an interview and I finally got my license. I was relaxed and happy and now my anxiety has come back. A little back story, I came home 10 mins late and argued with my mom about her making me dinner and now she hasn’t talked to me in 24hours, I feel defeated and sunken, I’ve lost motivation and I’m now worried about getting a job and going to school and doing well in boxing. I don’t know why I’m posting but I could do with a little bit of positivity right now Ig. I’m also very anxious about school and not having any friends in my classes (I took different classes to them)"
Anxiety,I feel terrible from the minute I wake up until I fall asleep,"It never gives me a break- it’s there before i wake up, in fact it wakes me up most of the time. Lately, I’ve been getting overwhelming feelings of guilt and sadness. So far nothing really works, talking to loved ones makes me feel worse, which then amplifies the guilty feeling. I feel like crying and throwing my guts up simultaneously. I’ve kind of accepted the fact that this is just my life as I’ve felt this way ever since I could remember (the sad guilt feelings are new though) here’s to hoping I don’t feel like shit 24/7 in the next life"
Anxiety,What to do when it's gotten a bit harder to cope?,"I've actually started to get a lot better until a couple days ago where it started to feel a lot worse. Heart palpitation here and there, resting heartbeat in the high eighties and lower nineties, especially and almost all the time during the day. At night it's 74-76 and sometimes even lower when I'm getting ready to go to bed."
Anxiety,Tradespeople won’t get out of my house!,"We were supposed to get a new en suite, 5 days starting 22nd November. They are still here!

I can’t cope. They arrive at 8am, I’m not normally up and dressed by that time. I hate being naked when there are strangers in my house. My husband sometimes doesn’t get out of the shower with enough time for me to get dressed. I’m ill today and I just want to cry. I’ve cancelled work today but I can’t stay in bed because the bloody plumber is in the en suite.

I went and sat in the car while my husband got our daughter ready. I’m not wearing socks or glasses or deodorant because those things were in my bedroom. I also shouted at my husband a lot, and feel bad about that."
Anxiety,I had this strong feeling that this will be my last year alive,"I was relaxing (smoking a bit of MJ too) and I had this feeling - it wasn’t scary (I DO struggle with anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar 2, but I’m medicated and doing well now).
The feeling was more of an all knowing peaceful feeling. But I’m hoping it’s just my anxiety being sneaky?

I just FELT like this year is my last year.

I didn’t “see”/ know what was going to happen - just that I won’t be here for too much longer.

I’m a 29 year old, otherwise physically healthy female. I don’t know what to make of this."
Anxiety,Is this an Anxiety-Thing?,"I'm not quite sure if my problem is an anxiety thing or just normal or something else so I'd appreciate your input:

I started making online friends due to covid. I started playing online RPGs (like D&amp;D) to make friends and practice social interactions. All interactions happen pretty much through discord. There's one person I really feel a friendly connection with and like to talk to and message. But he seems like a very reserved person and I'm always initiating contact.
We've messaged for hours yesterday and the day before. So now I feel anxiety about messaging him again because I don't want to seem needy or bother him. I'm just not sure if he's too nice to tell me I bother him or if he likes to talk to me. I also can't ask him that because I feel anxious about that, too.
I don't want to ruin a potential great friendship. So now I'm kind of in this awkward state of checking my discord every 5 minutes...seeing that he's online and closing it again because I'm afraid 😭

Does anyone have similar issues? How do you deal with it ?"
Anxiety,the uncomfortable-awkward in your skin-feeling,"Lately my anxiety- particularly social anxiety-has been the worst it’s ever been. I have high functioning anxiety so I mask it pretty well but some days, I have this intense feeling of uncomfortableness in my body. It’s not necessarily dissociation, but I feel wobbly, like I can’t walk straight. I feel like everyone is staring at me, and I just feel so awkward and out of place. It’s such an unsettling feeling. I hate this."
Anxiety,Anxiety so bad I feel like my brain is so fryed everyday.,I feel like I have anxiety to the point we’re I have twitching that is hard to control is there something wrong with me. Should I see a doctor?
Anxiety,scared for job interviews! any advice would be sooo appreciated:)!!,i have job/college interviews coming up and have no idea how to stay calm or what to do i get so scared talking to people and get worried about not being good enough/letting people down.
Anxiety,I can get heat waves of anxiety in my stomach on command and it really doesn’t let me live my life.,"It all started when I first smoked weed which I never smoke anymore. I got super high and I felt the nastiest heat of anxiety in my chest and stomach. Anxiety to the point of pain and extreme discomfort. Few anxiety attacks and years later and I recently discovered that I can create these heat waves in my chest on command . I know what you’re thinking. “Just don’t do it”, but I can’t help to overthink because I’m like obsessed with negative thoughts or something… does anybody relate please somebody out there…"
Anxiety,I dropped out of highschool and cant leave my house,"I have extreme social anxiety and was failing highschool so I switched to homeschooling. After a year of homeschooling I gave up completely and dropped out. I cut off the few friends I had completely and avoid all people as much as I can. I feel like my brain and memory have deteriorated to the point where I can't comprehend basic intructions and forget things almost instantly. The social anxiety mixed with this feeling of being an idiot make it that I can't go out and try to get a job. I don't want to have to interact with any people I literally can't work, and even if I do I'm too dumb to do a simple job. There's no way I'm going to an interview anyways. Same thing with driving, I don't want to drive because first of all I would have to interact with other people to be able to get a liscence, but the bigger problem is I definitely do not trust myself to drive. I feel like I would put myself and others at great risk because I cant remember any of the rules, and my awareness has become completely awful. I've spent 3 years just living with my parents and I'm starting to think I might end up living here until they die, then I guess I just kill myself. I definitely don't want kids but with my social anxiety I don't want a girl friend either. I'm a degenerate weeb loser and I wish I could buy cute anime stuff that I really like but my family would think I'm more of a loser than they already think. I only have like 3 ""friends"" that I play with online who went to my highschool but they completely hate anime and all the things I really like, they don't know the real me only a fake version of me and we never hang out in real life, only online. I haven't talked to them in over a week and I think I might cut them off too because if they new the real me I'm sure they would abandon me, they already did that to somebody else when they found out he was a furry. My social anxiety even stops me from going to the doctor, the dentist, to get my hair cut, I just feel so much anxiety whenever I'm outside of the house. My sleep schedule is that I sleep in the day and stay up at night to avoid my family as much as possible. Im hoping that in the future self driving cars are common and safe so I never have to get a liscence, and hopefully virtual reality gets to the point that I can just live with the characters that I love because I don't want to live with real people. I still have no idea what I would do about a job and responsibilities because I'm such an idiot so I won't even be able to afford those thing if they do come out in the future. :/"
Anxiety,My anxiety is really bad today I can barely focus on work,I am not able to focus on work since the morning because of my anxiety and I just want to take a day off. But the thing is I took 10 days off last month for recovery as I tested positive for Covid. Will it look bad if I take a day off? I could really use a day off. My mind is just not working like it's supposed to
Anxiety,Sleep issues :(,"25F, no health issues, I take buspar for anxiety 5mg 2x a day. I’m so tired. I can usually fall asleep just fine but wake up throughout the night and by 5-6 am I am awake for good, even on days I don’t have to be to work. I’m freaking out that I might have sleep apnea but I don’t wake up gasping for air and my boyfriend told me I never stop breathing or anything. Does anyone else struggle with this or have you? How do you cope? I can’t tell if I have racing thoughts or what it is."
Anxiety,It's 4 am and I can't catch my breath..,"It's 4 am. I have work at 9...kids need to go to school, husband has to work. It's never ending. It's always something. I live to work until I die. My only motivation is stolen moments with my husband and kids. I feel like every day is so hard. I'm aching inside tonight. I don't remember what to do. I don't know how to fix this. I feel like I'm falling apart."
Anxiety,Massive anxiety knowing ill never see my dad again,"My dad recently passed from stage 4 cancer, he was probably the strongest person I’ve ever seen and unfortunately lost his battle to this fucked up disease. I can’t stomach this situation. Knowing I will never be able to talk to him again makes my insides turn to soup. I already miss him so much and I can’t stop thinking about it. I try to distract myself with stuff but it will just hit me like a truck mid day and it destroys my mood and day. I just don’t know how to properly go about this, I’ve had bad anxiety before but it was anxiety about fake scenarios. This feels inescapable"
Anxiety,Can't get over silly little mistakes,"I think this is an anxiety issue. It's definitely impacting my ability to socialize. I have high functioning autism and I am a shut in I guess. I rarely go outside. And never socialize. 

Whenever I go to visit family, I sometimes try to make things interesting. Every year I make a quiz and give some prizes for it, and we also play Jackbox Party Packs which are really fun. The problem is, I'm not very good at quizes and nobody gives it criticism, and I'm often so nervous about hosting it that I forget the answers I had for some questions, meaning that, a lot of the silly mistakes are over giving the the wrong answer a prize.

&amp;#x200B;

That, and there's things I remember from a few years ago, like how before I developed social anxiety, I used to go to restaurants with family, and one time we were navigating a crowded restaurant, and my fat ass had to bump into someone's chair, all the people at the table were mad at me, and my family didn't really care. Went to that place a year later and had a panic attack. I couldn't stop thinking about that mistake. 

Then there's things I sometimes say that are just, cringe worthy, that I regret saying, or doing if it's an impression. I'm not very social anyway so I don't see a point in speaking unless it's something important or to respond to. 

It's slowly seeped its way into my online communication, where I'm unsure whether to post things or not. I only tend to post if I have full confidence in something I'm saying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do. I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts about past mistakes. And making ones in the future. People must think I'm an idiot when I do something like that. Not to mention my quizzes just sound like they're made by a child when it's not a question about pop-culture or some common thing we have (Like a TV show we've seen). I don't know what to do."
Anxiety,Hey,"I’ll keep this a short

I’m a teenager and I live a normal life, stable family,good friends, great education and so on but I feel like I’m starting to develop a sense of anxiety.I have no clue wether It’s all in my head or it’s something I should get checked up.Im starting to feel like my breathing has gotten worse whenever I’m alone and a overall sense of not being pleased in life.The only thing that seems to help is playing sports with my friends.But for example yesterday night I had what I think might be a minor panic attack.

I also find my self worrying about things that have happened in the past and things that will happen in the future eg : finding a job, starting a family ect.I have no clue wether all this is a normal thing for me to be experiencing.Please let me know if anyone experiences the same.

If you have anything to say please reply :)"
Anxiety,Recovering from panic attacks is my least favourite part of anxiety,"I had a very overwhelming weekend where I actually left the house and then had family over (because it was my birthday) and I think trying to face so many of my fears in 2 days just made my body crash. 

Yesterday I had 5 panic attacks, four very early on in the morning one after the other and the last one in the evening. Ever since then I've just felt shaky and sweaty (to the point of feeling feverish) and nauseous and my heart is beating out of my chest. I did a covid test just to be sure but it came back negative and I'm just so unbelievably fed up of feeling like this every time I have panic attacks.

I've been having panic attack ""hangovers"" like this for over 2 years now, where the recovery is worse than the actual attack because it just lingers and makes me feel awful, like no matter how much rest I get I'm just exhausted. This is definitely the worst I've felt in a while however and I'm not really sure what to do. I just want to feel okay again."
Anxiety,Scared of phone calls,"I just hate how my body reacts to making or receiving phone calls. My hands start to shake, i get cold sweats and a dry mouth  i also feel as my heart is about to burst out of my chest.
It's just makes me want to put my phone on airplane mode so i dont have to deal with the stress.
I really ruined some job opportunities because of my avoidant personality.
Im 23 now so it makes feel really guilty how this problem is still affecting me till this day.
I'd appreciate any tips from you guys. :("
Anxiety,DAE have pulsating feelings of euphoria when they're very anxious?,"I've dealt with anxiety as far back as I remember, but never had a full blown panic attack. What I do have is these weird blurry phases where I can't remember anything (putting a key under the mat, just to check again two seconds later) and my body is in extremely high alert. I get these pulsating motions through my body of some kind of euphoria. The feeling is so short-lived that I never think of it as anything positive at all, just wondering if you have experienced this? Is it adrenaline?   
I noticed the same feelings of waves of euphoria when I've done MDMA in the past (long time ago) so I recognize it as a ""good feeling"".   
Yeah, just wanted to hear if anybody else experiences this. 

thanks for this sub &lt;3"
Anxiety,Hydroxyzine helpful?,Did anyone have success? Failure? Whats your story?qa
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"For 4 months(March to August) I had severe anxiety due to some personal reasons but I was also enjoying my life. In August I had seizure since then I have dizziness and sudden heart palpitations. I also get sudden paranoia like thoughts. Sometimes my head jerks left to right. I see flashing lights when I close my eyes. I even went blind once. I took etilaam and propanolol for 1 month which made my condition more worse. After stopping the medicine I felt better but i still get the same episodes like before. I did some blood tests the reports showed high hemoglobin (17.4) and PCV(50.1). Doctor said this much high won't harm you. Can someone explain please it's been 6 months and I'm not cured yet.

Before getting seizure I saw something like confusion thing which is hard to explain. I had this confusion thing when I was 15 but it went quickly. I think it might be hypercapnia. Because I have bad habit of keeping my whole face covered while sleeping."
Anxiety,Texting makes me anxious,Its tough
Anxiety,I want to get help but it’s hard.,"I do talk about how my anxiety has been invalidated in my life, so if that triggers anyone, please take care if your needs. 

Ever since I graduated, my anxiety has gotten worse. I do live in a toxic house hold, so I think that’s why, but it’s gotten to the point, I can’t be out in public because I feel like I’m going to have an anxiety attack, and that alone gives me anxiety. I lock myself up in my room a lot of the times, because I’m either depressed or dealing with really bad anxiety and I really can’t talk to people. I’m tired of my mind racing 24/7. I just want it to shut up. I want to be able to actually work, because at this point, I can’t even go out in public without some type of panic. I don’t know what to do. I wanna go to a new therapist to help me, but it’s hard for me to open up about how bad my anxiety is, because it’s been invalidated all of my life, so I don’t want people saying that “it’s nothing and your being overdramatic,” when I can barely talk to people and hold down a job, because it’s getting so bad. It’s to the point I want to be alone, just so I don’t feel anxious anymore. Why is anxiety such a persistent battle? I really just want my life back."
Anxiety,I have a pit in my stomach pretty much 100% of the time.,[removed]
Anxiety,Anxiety about anxiety,"I am not a newbie to anxiety. I have experienced that it comes and goes in few months long lasting episodes. But everytime the episode hits me, I always feel super anxious of having anxiety. Like I cant even enjoy anything else, because I am 90% of the day anxious about not feeling good. I dont think I am any much depressed as I am not sad, I dont hate myself, I dont wanna die, I dont think I am a failure, I am not tired. So I just wanna know, is unability to enjoy life and hobbies and and friends, food and anything, is it symptom of anxiety as well?"
Anxiety,Just threw a tantrum out of nothing,"So. Basically I had an incident with my mic turning on during an online lesson and everyone allegedly hearing what I said  (they were talking about one teacher giving a student F and I said ""serves you right"" - they all bully me for being an outcast btw so that's fun) . I left asap turned off my phone and had a panic attack. Those lessons are stressing enough already and I cant go without throwing up out of stress everyday cuz of it. My thoughts circled around everyone now hating me for things I said, them talking behind my back, me now being a social reject (a bigger one at least)  and world literally ending right now. Turns out no one heard a thing and doesnt even know what happened and I just had a really big argument with my mother and learning shes sick of my ""illness"" and thinks Im a manipulative attention whore.  Also my eyes really hurt from crying yay.

I think shes right. Maybe I just really dont have problems so Im creating them myself. Am I crazy? I am so lost. How can I be ""normal"" again?"

Anxiety,Cute things to watch to ease anxiety?,Any recs for shows or youtube videos? Something calm and possibly cute. Currently watching Rilakkuma and Kaoru.
Anxiety,Weightloss/health,My anxiety has gotten better but I feel like a part of my anxiety has to do with my weight. I feel like if I lose weight and get to a healthy weight most of this anxiety will be gone because I’m always questioning what if I get a heart attack or shortness of breath gives me anxiety. Does anyone know if you losing weight made your anxiety better?
Anxiety,I’m struggljng,"My anxiety keeps coming back in waves lately and I get so panicked when I feel sick cause I’ve got a phobia which makes my anxiety even worse. I really don’t know what to do , I’m shaking I’ve been in a state of panic since last night"
Anxiety,Do you ever feel like you did something wrong after communicating with another person?,"I’m a girl. Or a woman. Whatever. I can have a little bit of a fire-y personality where I can speak my mind especially in the event to protect someone else. 

The thing is most of the time after doing this I feel like I did something wrong. Sometimes I don’t do anything and just feel like I am getting on peoples nerves. I could have also zero communication with someone for days, and feel like they’re annoyed with me or holding back telling me how they really feel (negatively) about me. 

Like for example, yesterday- I sent an email defending my client and saying how a particular protocol is a bad idea (scares and angers most clients).

It ended up being fine but I look back and just wish I didn’t stand up for anything. I just feel like it makes me LESS respected and I dwell on it, and every day I just feel like I did something wrong and someone is rolling their eyes at me behind my back or calling me a bitch.

I guess it’s a bit like when you look back on a cringey moment and cringe but these moments, at the time, aren’t always cringe or even embarrassing! They could just be me standing up for myself, speaking my mind, having a voice…. But the aftermath is always feeling crappy about it and wishing I never did in the first place. 

Does anyone else experience this? Just a constant feeling of feeling like you did something wrong.  Also reminds me of the feeling of when you forget to do something but can’t remember what it is. Or feeling like someone is annoyed with you for having an opinion."
Anxiety,Anyone NOT experience any sexual side effects on an SSRI? (Lexapro),"Hi all, I just started Lexparo (Escitalopram) 5mg which is the lowest dose possible. I have very bad health anxiety/GAD and some OCD. I do not get panic attacks.

I have put off taking medication for about 10 years despite being offered it because of hearing so many bad things about side effects. With SSRIs, sexual side effects seem especially common. 

However, I wonder if I am seeing a disproportionate number of bad experience as people tend to talk about that more.

In particular, **anyone NOT experience any sexual side effects like libido loss, erectile dysfuncftion etc.?** I'm hoping being on a low dose will decrease the chance of this.

I need to hear some stories of people who haven't experienced this, because unless I do my anxiety has convinced me 100% that it's going to happen to me (I've already been checking even though I took my first pill a few hours ago only)

Any general positive experiences with Lexapro or SSRI shared as well would be great - thanks!"
Anxiety,How do I do anything while worrying about my mother’s health?,I feel so useless. I’m so scared that I just want to die. But I think suicide would be worse. Even if they don’t care about me. I don’t think they’ll take suicide very lightly. Right? I wanna disappear. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow.
Anxiety,I am confused,"I just want to ask if I am recovering or my mental health is getting worse, it kinda confuses me a lot. I rarely have anxiety and panic attacks now but most of the time I still have intrusive thoughts that I am aware and there are a lot of things going through my mind also I usually question my thoughts if they are real or something I should be worried about. I can say that I can function normally from a day to day basis and If someone talks to me I can respond quickly and think but I still feel so weird and empty. I still can't enjoy the things that I used to enjoy. My mind is always trying to find something to think about and be obsessed with. Is this normal in the recovery process or is this something that I should address asap?TIA"
Anxiety,I am terrified of World War 3,"I am 27 and have struggled with severe anxiety my entire life. I've been in and out of therapy (some have been more helpful than others). I have been considering medication but very hesitant to start. 

Anyways, I first heard about the Russia-Ukraine news a couple of weeks ago (well, I knew tensions were high between them for years, but I just heard about the possibility of invasion a couple of weeks ago). Since then, I have been following the news by the minute every single day (turns out most news stories or just repeats of each other). It is so terrifying though and I am so scared and convinced this will be WW3. I keep hearing leaders say an invasion would be ""horrific"" and impact much more than just Ukraine. And Biden said it would be the worst conflict since WW2. I am so scared. I am just starting my life (about to get married and buy a house, start having kids shortly after). I am also ruining my relationship with my fiance because I am in a horrible mood everyday (crying, moopy) due to this. I am also so worried my partner will be drafted. We are in Canada so don't even have a draft / conscription. We did very briefly (last few months) of world war 1 and 2. But our Emergency Act says we cannot force people to serve in the event of a war. But I still worry.

I think there will be a WW3 because:

1) Russia will get pissed off with our sanctions and physically retaliate. 

2) Even though NATO \*said\* no boots on the ground, I'm worried they won't follow this and still place troops in Ukraine. 

3) Russia gets pissed off because NATO is helping Ukraine and surrounding the Baltics so physically retaliate. 

Any words of comfort? Anyone else struggling? I am freaking tf out! I can't enjoy anything in life. I can't even look forward to my wedding :("
Anxiety,Morning anxiety,"Does anyone else get morning anxiety especially when their the first person up? 
I’d like to understand why it happens and how to cope with it, I smoke weed but if I do it as soon as I wake up, I usually cough till I throw up my drink and stomach acid. What else can I do?"
Anxiety,My social anxiety must be baddd.,"Just half an hour ago i walked into my local store, mask on and everything, the store is pretty busy as well.
Before I’ve been in the shop for 10 seconds, one of the workers, similar age to me, says “are you alright mate, you look concerned or worried about something” 
Yes for your information, I am, but how did you know!?! I literally have my mask on!
This shit can be so so exhausting."

Anxiety,Tips for flying alone for the first time?,Going to be flying on a plane alone for the first time here soon and I'm absolutely terrified something's gonna go horribly wrong. Like I've been on flights many times before so I know the process and all that; I've just never been on one by myself before and I'm just a bit worried. I have anxiety as well as a bit of social anxiety. I really want to try and be a bit more independent but I'm a bit worried about how this is all gonna go. If y'all have any tips or anything like that I'd greatly appreciate it...

Anxiety,"God bless my psychiatrist, I've finally been prescribed the holy sqaure. 🔥💘😃🍾","My psychiatrist is the best, after over a year of building a relationship with him I've finally earnt his trust. I'm now prescribed alprazolam 2mg three times a day, I always take 2mg for my first dose, then with the remaining two I break them into quarters and halves and dose either 0.5mg, 1mg or 1.5mg depending on my anxiety/panic levels. Although if it's too much I'll take a full 2mg.

I'm also prescribed nitrazepam 5-10mg at night as a prn.

Then I'm prescribed 300mg pregabalin twice a day for extra anxiety support.

Then lastly I'm prescribed 70mg once a day that I take each morning.

If you're curious about what I've been diagnosed, please feel free to ask.

But for the first time I feel like a normal person, it somewhat reminds me being a kid again seeing life so clearly and magical with so much beauty.

I'm honestly blessed, most psychiatrists in my city don't prescribe double benzos, pregabalin and it's nearly impossible to gain enough trust to get a legal amphetamine script.

🙏✝️🌠🍾😃💯😇"
Anxiety,Are there people who have managed to overcome their anxiety attacks? (dissociation),"What I experience is sudden anxiety attacks, I just become PANIC and lose ALL notion of reality. 

I would like to hear from you if you used to have these crises, how did you manage to overcome these crises? Or it's impossible it's still there but you have learned to live with it?

Thank you, I admit I just need hope"
Anxiety,anxiety towards being perceived,"it’s safe to say i’ve always had anxiety. but after the pandemic and the suicide of a loved one, my anxiety and depression truly skyrocketed. the death of my loved one definitely struck a lot of nerves, and caused my anxiety to definitely worsen. aside from survivors guilt, i suddenly became extremely wary of my surroundings. always thinking about how easy it is to die, anything can happen. living in a very populated and active city, i can walk outside and be struck by a truck at any moment (ex). and suddenly i didn’t want to go outside as much anymore. actively avoiding situations.

but then the pandemic hit.. and considering how fucking terrified everyone was in the beginning, it definitely took its toll. because at that point, i had a legit excuse to avoid seeing everyone. family, friends, finding a job, etc. 

but as of late, my anxiety has shifted from death to being perceived. after spending an unhealthy amount of time inside and inactive, i’ve gained a ton of weight. went from around 130ish to 160 within a span of two years. stopped posting on my socials, haven’t seen friends since before the pandemic so no one outside of my close relatives and boyfriend have seen how much i’ve gained. in reality it’s silly and stupid, but the idea of being perceived and people having negative thoughts about me has crippled me. and having severe depression and untreated adhd has made it EXTREMELY difficult for my to get my life in order and bring me back to a weight i’m happy with. all in all, it sucks and i miss who i used to be before the pandemic. yes, i still had social anxiety but i at least put in an effort to go out and see people and do things that benefited me. now, i’m lazy i’m overweight and so very unhappy. and the idea of people knowing that scares me, so i hide it. i hide it by dodging hangout plans and family get togethers, deleting social medias so no one expects selfies or day to day posts about whats going on (bc nothing is), and doing stupid things like giving bug bite excuses when my dad notices the stretch marks on my calves bc the idea of telling him it happened because of weight gain sends me into a spiral so instead i tell him i’ve been scratching at a bug bite a bit too hard. 

i really shouldn’t care what people think of me, but i think now that i’m constantly bringing myself down i automatically assume everyone else will do the same. i can’t figure out how to get over this. i want to work, i’m 22 and can’t expect my family to support me forever. i want to move out and start my own life and meet new people bc that’s what i deserve. but the anxiety always manages to take over. i get spurts of energy where i decide to make plans with friends i haven’t seen in years then bail on them bc i’m afraid of what they’ll think when they see me. my anxiety has made me very lonely, and i hate it. i want to get over this fear but i have no idea how."
Anxiety,I'm at the end of my rope.,"Anxiety is absolutely ruining my life. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been in therapy for 6 years, and it hasn't helped a single bit. I've only gotten worse. I am finally considering going on medication, but I am not very hopeful about it. I wanted to ask if people are/were on medication about their experiences with it and if it's worth actually trying or if I should just skip that step and check myself into a psych ward right now, because I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't been to work in a month, I'm constantly on edge. I don't know what to do anymore."

Anxiety,How to conquer morning anxiety?,I’ve read a few threads on this already but was just curious for other opinions. I have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder which I take Zoloft for but most mornings I wake up pretty anxious.

Curious if anyone has other tricks that helped them?
Anxiety,"Anyone had this, feeling sick, feeling not like yourself, feeling disgusting? like a character?","Idk, this happens when I go out. It's not me. I think to every detail and it happens whether I choose it or not. I can't sit on the train, comfortably, always feeling like others are watching me -- maybe its a combination of factors -- 1. I dont have friends, so .. 2. no date either .. 3. life experiences compilation .. 

It gets to a point where, it just idk, it turns to a mess, you lose it, you feel disgusting, you feel the urge to run away and hide from people.. Idk .. I usually feel sick, when I say sick, I mean that, you feel sick about social media, how people present themselves, the topic of people itself, celebrities, everything...

Hope this makes sense, anyone experience this? 

I hate it when this happens, you can't enjoy anything at all in that moment, you look down upon the people that inspire you too. you just feel sick about everyone. relate? hard to put it in words"
Anxiety,doubting if i’m a good person i said i was,i can’t breathe and it seems like the words to the express the thoughts i have is eating up. i feel stupid. i shouldn’t have been so open even though i was advised to open up after bottling up my emotions. i seem to exaggerate every word i say and i’m putting the blame off someone else even though it’s mostly my fault. i know we all make mistakes but somehow my brain refuses to accept it and my whole body is feeling sick.
Anxiety,I've found going swimming really helpful,"Not sure if anyone else would find this useful but I've found that going swimming really helps my anxiety. I think it's because I have to focus hard on the physical act of swimming (like timings, breath etc) and it tires me out so I go to sleep easily at that night. 
It's also not my main sport so I quite enjoy being able to exercise without any pressure to be doing well. 

So if you're someone whose anxiety is relieved / eased by exercise I would recommend :)"

Anxiety,How to projecting my anxiety onto unrelated things?,"Hi all,

I find that when I’m anxious about an exam or rushing to school, for example, I tend to project this anxiety into unrelated matters. I start worrying about things that have no relation to the present feeling and are not based on reality. 

Is this normal? How do you deal with this?"

One month later and I'm already fantasizing about killing myself, my death, how other people would react, etc.

I've been on treatment for almost 4 years now and I've had only a few weeks free of suicidal thoughts so far."

Anxiety,Might be a lil long. Looking for your experience with beta blockers,Ok so I started taking buspirone twice a day last July. Started at 5mg and now I’m up to 15mg. My heart rate not to sure in beginning if buspirone help lower it. I know when I wake up it’s usually around 110 to 120 when I’m walking around. Then I take buspirone and it will drop to about 100. Still go up to 120 when walking around though. My b/p avg about 136/90 and I smoke a pack a day. So I talked to my dr over the phone yesterday and explained bout my heart rate. Even when I’m sitting dwn it’s at 100plus. Not all the time though sometimes it is below 100. Right now my heart rate is at 104 and I’m just sitting here doing this post. So my dr wants me to try out metoprolol at a small dose. I read up a lil on it and saw some ppl with social anxiety are prescribed this also. So my question is what is anyones experience with this and are they good to try out. I’m thinking if it helps lower my heart rate to below 100 most of the day then my anxiety in turn won’t be so bad eaither. Thts what I’m thinking since at night when my heart rate is in the high 80s to low 90s I do feel better then I do through out the day. Any experiences anyone has had with this would help. Just curious. Thanks in advance
Anxiety,Any tips to stop globus sensation?,"It’s been 2 weeks and I’m going insane, I know it will go away as soon as I lower my stress levels, but right now I can’t even sleep because of it.

Anxiety,How to relief base of stress related skull/sub-occipital pain?,"I get really bad spasms at the base of my skull whenever I’m overwhelmed, which is everyday. It’s so bad that I can’t return to working full time if it continues. It flares up pain in the rest of my body and makes my arms and legs tingle. I’m so introverted that holding regular conversation is tiring. It’s especially tiring in a professional setting where I’m expected to be friendly and cordial. I just feel like I can’t be myself. My Fear of forgetting something because of my ADHD also worsen the muscle tension. Any advice would be appreciated."
Anxiety,Freaking out over professor changing entire class structure.,"I have one in-person class this spring. My professor changed the entire syllabus the first day due to students complaining about having to write an essay (it's a history course). She now sent an email out late last night that as a result of students not wanting to write an essay, she is going to change the majority of the grade to a weekly 2-3 paragraph discussion post. The Prof. is now saying that you can only answer the question by coming to class because you have to cite in-person lectures in your post. 

Now we're not allowed any absences under any circumstances. While I've never missed large amounts of class time, I do have health ailments, including severe anxiety and OCD that can be debilitating at times. In addition to that, with the ongoing pandemic, there is a chance of acquiring COVID and having to isolate for 5 days, especially because my college is not practicing social distance in classrooms or proper ventilation. I'm not sure how to go about this and I'm really stressing over her changing the entire class grade and attendance structure because a few students were annoyed at having to write an essay. It also concerns me that if no absences are allowed as it will lower your grade, people may attend while they're sick and is feeding into my paranoid health anxiety.

Sorry to rant, I don't know where to go and now my once dormant and controlled panic attacks are out of control."
Anxiety,My death anxiety so so bad now,"That I wish I were depressed . I didn’t fear dying when depressed. Now I live in terror 24/7 and only getting worse as I age . Having medical issues now that potentially could be very serious , making it even worse"
Anxiety,why are people ( including myself) ashamed of having anxiety and panic attack?," 

Every time I recall my anxiety attack and ask myself ,,why did I freak out ,what could be the worst scenario'' the only answer is that : ,,well if i freak out ,people will judge me harshly ,they will think that I am crazy and something is wrong with me ''

I would never ever judge anyone for having anxiety or panic ,even more I think that people who will judge me just bc of my anxiety or panic are idiots ...but why do I care so much what people think of me ?( well,I live in super conservative country and my upbringing style was overly critical but still... .) even after reading so much about anxiety ,why am I so ashamed of having panic attack and anxiety ? it is like I have a dark secret and I am hiding it from other world ...I know many people have this feeling .my logical mind knows that nothing is shameful about anxiety and it just means that maybe I am strong person for dealing with it ....but subconsciously I still deal with unexplained guilt and shame ...

why are we so scared of admitting our daily struggle ? what makes mental problem so shameful and dark ?"

Anxiety,I messed up my academic career,"I messed up my academic career by cheating on an exam for an elective class, looking at the course page for a long time even though I thought I was only on there for a bit, according to the browser history. I’m so confused I don’t trust my memory anymore. The course is over and all that. Every day I’m anxious, and depressed because I might have also plagiarized the short essay questions, I can’t fully recall if I did or not, nor where I plagiarized the material from for gods sake. I look at websites to try and recall, they look familiar but also not. I deleted my history so I can’t go back and check either. 

I made a massive mistake that could cost everything, now I don’t know if I did more than that. Sometimes I want to ask to see the exam again to confirm if I really did plagiarize. I’m confused about why I thought I had only been on the browser for a while when it doesn’t Match up with the history. Was I just idle? 

Am I just having irrational thoughts over this? I remember paraphrasing concepts like we were supposed to but what if I still plagiarized? 

Just wanted to get this out because the consequences if I did fuck up this badly would be me losing everything to this one elective. I understand if you have negative comments about my integrity but please keep it to yourself at this point because I fully understand that I’m still at fault here regardless of how stressed or tired I was at the time of the exam. Just wanted to get it out because I’m fully prepared to lose everything I worked for in college till now if it does happen"
Anxiety,I was supposed to hang out with my best friend today,"I was supposed to go on a hike today with my best friend because the weather is decent compared to the urban winter hellscape we've been experiencing. Normally even if my anxiety level is high, I'm able to do it because the workout helps and he likes to stay away from heavy population areas. Though today I couldn't do it. I woke up late (no issue for my bff) Though I could hear my landlord and superintendent bickering about changing the wash machine outside my apartment. I've had no heads up about it, it was working fine the last time I used it (Thursday) 

I know that my LL can shut water/power off to do emergency repairs without notice (I don't think fixing the wash machine without notice is an emergency, when they're 4 laundromats in the immediate neighbourhood...but alright I guess).

 Though literally knocking on my door minutes before they do repairs is extremely frustrating and a massive trigger. I've tried to explain my social anxiety to them but it doesn't click in there heads. Email, text, written fucking letter or even calling me instead of knocking on my door. Anyways sorry guys I just needed to get this off my chest. My bff offered to come over and try to help me feel better but I didn't want to put him in the position of explaining that I AM home, I'm just having an extremely bad anxiety day and can't answer the door. 

I was afraid to get a glass of water because they would hear the water running.....I don't want to feel like this."

Anxiety,I have grossly severe social anxiety. I don't know what to do anymore. It's ruining my life.,"I don't know if I can do this anymore. This anxiety is fucking relentless. Every year of my life it just progressively gets worse and worse. Every single fucking day anymore my heart feels like it's just going to beat out of my chest, my blood pressure is ridiculously high just sitting still. I can't socialise with anybody at all. It's so bad I can't even be around my family anymore. I basically just live in my room. I haven't been working because I've been laid off for the winter because there's no work (I work in construction). The only thing that seems to potentially help me socialise is an unhealthy amount of alcohol. I hate it but it works... Going to the grocery store is an absolute nightmare. It's not going to be long before I legitimately have a heart attack literally just because I'm around other people. It's absolutely fucking ridiculous. I want out of this body. I woke up today just sick of it. I want to fight the entire world. I want to just run away from everything, I want to just keep running, I want to run for dear fucking life! 

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm honestly not too far away from sticking a shotgun in my mouth and blowing my fucking brains out. What the fuck do I do?"
Anxiety,I almost fainted a month ago. I need your support,"Hello again guys. So a month ago after a bad ill I almosted fainted and after that my panick attacks came back. 

I just felt like I lost control and also I am a hypochondriac(I am afraid of all kind of illness) 

I went to a lot of doctors, I made all my blood, heart, diabet, everything checks and all the doctors told me that I am ok and still my anxiety is going crazy. 

Everybody told me that this was maybe mentally or just after being very ill my body just was very tired. What do you think?

Did you have these kind of experiences?

I am starting again therapy this week and also taking pills"
Anxiety,Health anxiety back after chronic disorder diagnosis. What can I do?,"Hi everybody, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for how to get pass my health anxiety because it is ruining my life. Ever since I can remember I have always had hypochondria tendencies. I remember using germ x until my hands bled and refusing to go to school because of all the germs. I also was extremely afraid of dying in general from weird brain eating bacteria to rare cancer going undiagnosed. I grew out of this to a bearable degree as I got older until now I am 22 and actually do have health issues that I was always so scared of. I have been in debilitating pain for two months to the point where I couldn’t move, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, just laying there screaming and crying. When I was 18 I had this same problem and it almost killed me because I had fluid in my abdomen that almost caused sepsis. They had ran test after test (CT scans, ultrasounds, bloodwork) and everything came back normal. The only way they caught it is they did an exploratory laparoscopy. They never told me what happened to cause it except “it was probably an appendix rupture.” I tried to comfort myself with things like “they caught it so I’m okay now” and tried to pass it off as my hypochondriac tendencies to worry about my health. That is until it came back. The pain has been slowly creeping back ever since. I’ve been trying to go to doctors and tell them, but just like before test after test showed nothing. It got to the point I was having abdominal pain so bad it felt like I was dying. I went to the er twice, talked to multiple doctors, ran more tests than I can count. Nothing. My tests were all coming back normal. I thought I was going insane. The doctors thought I was insane. They sent me home from the ER while I was still doubled in pain and labeled me a drug seeker. Doctors would run tests and shrug their shoulders and say “I don’t know” and send me to another doctor who would say “I don’t know.” Until I finally was able to convince a doctor to do an exploratory laparoscopy again. They found my insides covered with endometriosis tissue that had attached my organs in weird places, resulting in excruciating pain. My appendix was fully intact with no signs of appendicitis but my right ovary and Fallopian tube are gone. No one knows what happened to it. No one knows what caused what happened to me last time. I should be relieved they found the endometriosis though right? That at least explains something? I am, I really am, but after everything that has happened I am traumatized. I can’t sleep, I just keep having dreams where I’m in excruciating pain and everyone just keeps not believing me. The worst part about endometriosis is there is no cure and no one treatment plan that works for everyone. She excised the endometriosis and that’s supposed to help with the pain. It’s two weeks later, and although the incisions are healing my insides still hurt so bad. It’s hard to move. My life is a fraction of what it once was. I’m scared I’ll be in this much pain forever now. My head feels like it’s going to explode I am so blown away by all of this. I still am scared there’s something more to this besides just my endometriosis, but I am so exhausted and horrified with how doctors have treated me that I’m scared to even go back. I just want to rest besides being constantly paranoid I’m about to die. What can I do?"
Anxiety,Waking up with racing heart,"After Covid I developed anxiety, heart related stuff, and panic attacks. I recently got kinda better with the heart rate and palpitations BUT this is my second day on Paxil 10 and I was jolted out of my sleep to a 160 heart rate and all most passed out. I took a propanolol 10 and tried to calm down and eventually did. Is this related to the Paxil? I haven’t had a heart rate so high since probably may 2021."

Anxiety,Woke up at 4 am due to stress about what I need to complete today...,"Which will make it harder to complete the damn tasks. I hate it. 

Lack of sleep = increased anxiety = harder to do your job = increased anxiety about making mistakes because you gave to do it anyway and can't put it off an extra day."
Anxiety,"Just when I think I've regained control, I lose it again","I have persistent and debilitating health anxiety, which generally focuses around the symptom of a mysterious tightness in my upper left chest near my heart. I recently finally rationalized my way out of it, after correlating it to food and determining it was gas pain/acid reflux. I was so relieved and I felt a massive weight off of my chest (no pun intended).

However, I've started to second guess myself YET again today. Everywhere I've read online says that the associated pressure/tightness with eating will affect the center of the chest, if it is indeed acid reflux -- I get it in the left side right under my pectoral. In addition, I do get ""spicy burps"" and regurgitate chunks of food, but not very often. It's primarily just the tightness in my upper left chest. 

I know anxiety can also cause chest tightness, but I'll get this even when I'm not really thinking of anything at all, so I can't confidently make that association.

This constant worrying and doubt about my health is very new for me, as of a month ago, and it's quickly becoming a huge drain. I've had my heart checked at the ER, and I was cleared of any acute abnormalities, though I still have an appointment with a cardiologist to be completely in the clear. I alternate between thinking I don't need the appointment because I'm probably fine, and thinking I must go because there's something deeply wrong with me.

I am now constantly looking at old pictures and reminiscing over the days before I was at these terrible heights of anxiety. Reliving those moments is the only semblance of comfort I get. This behavior has cast me into a different kind of spell, however: that of a depressive episode. But that's a whole other story, and I've already typed way too much."
Anxiety,I've been stuck in an obsessive thought loop for over a week,"I don't want to go into too much detail, but there's been a lot of death and sickness in my family the last two months (nothing related to Covid). Literally one thing after another, I feel like I'm in shitty Groundhog Day. Up until this point I've been fortunate in that I've never really had to deal with major loss, but now I have to face the reality that my grandmother is turning 80 and my mother won't be around forever. This has decided to manifest as worrying about my mom feeling rejected by the kitten we adopted 2 weeks ago. She's told me multiple times she doesn't feel that way and I'm not going to bring it up with her again because I can tell I'm annoying her, but I can't shake the thought that she's lying to make me feel better. I know logically this isn't even about the kitten, it's about worrying about my mom's mental health and my fear of losing her, but I can't get out of this obsessive thought loop. It's exhausting and I just want it to stop. Sorry if I'm being kind of vague, I'm just trying to get my thoughts down in a somewhat cohesive manner."
Anxiety,What's even the point,"Can people like us even make it in this world? 
Idk if I even care anymore."
Anxiety,I don’t want to watch my baby cousin,"

His family left to the Bahamas and left me to watch their stupid dog for a week and said they would pay me but they didn’t, last time I heard from them. My mom doesn’t care. I don’t want to watch their baby while they go out to do whatever the fudge. Also very anxious. I hate myself for this."
Anxiety,new job anxiety,"Hey guys I’m really freaking out right now. My current job I’m leaving is taking forever to get back to me with a reference for my new job which I should have started already. They told me they might have to re list the job because time is getting on now. I just feel so betrayed that my current company who I’ve given more than 5 loyal years to, is possibly costing me this new position. My anxiety is through the roof.

I don’t necessarily need advice regarding this, I just want some words that may ease this anxiety. I can’t take it anymore.

I’ve just taken 5mg diazepam but dunno if it’ll help."
Anxiety,It's controlling my dating life,"I, 29m, use a lot of online dating apps, and I don't even bother looking at women's profiles if they're over 15 miles away. I have a fear of driving throughways so it turns what could have been a 15-20 minute drive into a 45-1 hour drive taking a non throughway route. I honestly don't even like driving. I've considered living car free but the only thing stopping me is that I know it would totally kill any hopes of finding someone and maintaining a relationship.

I have a 1st date tomorrow with a beautiful woman, and the only thing stressing me out is how to get to the place. She lives 13 miles away and I picked a place 7 miles away for us to meet. 

I'm on google maps figuring out an easy route and doing street view to see landmarks and what lanes I should be in. I could take an uber but I'm worried I'll look bad or he'll make me late, and hoping i could get one home. I'm worried my phone might die mid trip and my cigarette charger only works sporadically. Or google maps won't work.

I'm worried if this date actually goes well how will I make it work long term. I feel like a loser. I'm 29 stressing this and she's only 23 and could probably do this in her sleep"
Anxiety,I am over this so much!! These stupid worries are destroying me!,Everything I do I worry about. Literally anything I do I worry I tore a muscle or stuffed my vision up. Right now I am scared because I turned the BBQ on and I fet a bit of the heat on my face. Now I’m worried i have damaged my eyes. I don’t no wtf to do anymore i can’t keep living like this
Anxiety,Getting sick of this,"I'd love to just go ONE day without feeling anxious about everything. From the moment I wake up until I can finally fall asleep is just overthinking and constant anxiety about a million different things.

IM TIRED OF IT. I'm tired of being anxious about shit I can't control. I'm tired of the voice in my head that beats me down every time I stand back up. I'm trying to achieve the things I want from my life and career. But my stupid anxiety both mentally and physically prevents me from doing that without having multiple problems along the way, that I wouldn't have if I didn't have GAD. 

I wan't to accept my anxiety disorder as who I am, but it's so hard when the fight to be who I want to be gets hindered by anxiety every time. 

Not only that, but my poor husband gets to deal with me crying and worrying almost 24/7. He says it's okay but I know how draining it is.

How can I accept this part of me when I'm mad that it is part of me."
Anxiety,I cant quit caffeine and its causing horrible anxiety,"I cant quit, I stop for a week, convince myslef that im ""good to go"" and then proceed to drink energy drinks/soda for a week and then have horrible anxiety/panic symptoms at the end of said week. This week has been one of those, I drank energy drinks all week and now I have work in the morning and im up having bad anxiety. I need to figure out how to quit caffeine."
Anxiety,TW: Death anxiety. Unmedicated/Havent found a good new therapist yet. Has anyone dealt with this or has advice please?,I have no one to talk to idk if this is the right place to post but you all seem nice. I have had a debilitating fear of death the past couple of weeks (i genuinely feel paralyzed and constantly panicking) i even wake up randomly with the realization that i’m going to cease to exist and wanna start screaming. Its like i know its inevitable but how was i just living with the thought before without being this traumatized by the idea? how do other ppl do this? Its really too much for me and i cant keep going like this. i suffer from anxiety/ocd in general and i’m terrified of losing loved ones or leaving loved ones behind specially if i cant be with them in the afterlife but this thing about my own death is new and im not sure i can tolerate it more than this. I just want someone to give me their perspective and help me.
Anxiety,Anxiety about Blood Pressure,Good day folks. So I'm someone who is extremely anxious about a lot of stuff and I've been on blood pressure Meds as well instructed to monitor my blood pressure. Recently I've started experiencing strong bouts of anxiety regarding taking the blood pressure measurements leading to very high readings and pulse rates. It's strange because until recently I had normal readings but suddenly my anxiety is back and it's even stronger than usual. I'm not quite sure how to handle it and thought I might ask for suggestions here. I think I suffer from a lot of compulsive/obsessive thinking as well and have been meaning to work on that. I'm just a little lost and feeling very uneasy with the whole thing.
Anxiety,85 year old who’s constantly nervous,"My grandmother is constantly nervous. She is always saying how her nerves are a wreck. I feel horrible and don’t know how to calm and make things less nerve wracking. I know it’s affecting her overall health.

Things she used to love doing now just give her anxiety. Like having dinner up at my uncles house was something she loved…today she was a complete wreck. We have a somewhat big family and she loves us, but when we try to get together for her she just becomes a nervous mess. 

She had a stroke about 4 years ago and wasn’t supposed to live, but did. She never got back to her 100% self. One of those things me and my family noticed is that she is very anxious. 

My pap died this year and I think that has made it worse as she is now alone. 

We can usually gauge her nervousness on how fast her leg is bouncing while seated. Lately it’s nonstop. 

I just want her to be okay and to be able to enjoy whatever time is left. 

Any help, advice, articles, is welcomed. 

(Sometimes her being so nervous makes us all on edge)"
Anxiety,what helps u with your anxiety,"My anxiety has reached its peak this past 2 months, i can’t find a way to control it. Its constant i’ve been up for days because i cant fall asleep from shaking and imagining the worst. Doctors dont want to prescribe me medication and i have no solution. Would like some help, Thank You"
Anxiety,I have the type of anxiety that completely ruins lifes.,"I can already see my future. Depressed, lonely, paranoid, alcoholic, homeless, criminal piece of shit. I can't hold down a job, and don't have enough confidence or motivation to do anything worth ANYTHING.

The mental health system will never help and probably never will unfortunately. Unless a miracle occurs, I can only imagine that I am literally doomed for a horrible future. Everything is already so fucked up lol.

I don't think there is any hope for me."
Anxiety,What medication has helped you with daily anxiety?,"I want to talk with my doctor next month about starting a daily medication to help curtail my anxiety. Currently I receive a small supply of Xanax, 0.5mg / 20 a month, reserved for panic attacks. I thought this would be OK but for whatever reason my anxiety has been getting worse the last couple months - my routines are structured around it, I’m struggling in all areas of life outside of work. Xanax works exceptionally well when I am having a panic attack or entering a situation I know is going to be mentally taxing. To be honest, if I could take it daily, I would, because nothing makes me feel as normal as it does. However, truthfully, the medication absolutely terrifies me and I treat it with respect and reserve it only for emergency situations. I have an addictive personality and have watched it ruin peoples lives. 

I’m not looking for a diagnosis, just some insight into what has helped others prescription wise. I was once on celexa and didn’t notice much difference other than weight gain and libido. My anxiety has progressed from being triggered by only a handful of scenarios (flights, doctor visits) to spilling over into a general state of worry / anxiousness on a daily basis. It’s incredibly frustrating and it’s making day to day life increasingly difficult. I find myself avoiding people, crowds, large stores. Hell, even small stores and small crowds, which has never happened before. Another issue is that I have a phenomenal job that lets me travel the world and instead of enjoying it I’m just scared and anxious all the time. It’s also a big trigger - my job requires expo work, 1000s of people, huge open spaces, tons of visual stimuli. It’s overwhelming. I don’t want to down Xanax to get through what should be a fun and rewarding experience. 

The worst part about it is I seem to go into overdrive immediately when the panic hits. My fight or flight kicks in, I feel floaty, disorientated &amp; like I’m going to pass out. The only thing that helps is immediately leaving the situation which isn’t always an option so, sadly, not being in the situation to begin with is the solution. I’m just tired of living my life like this. My biggest fear is going into hysterics in front of colleagues or worse yet passing out. Sorry to ramble, I’ve never shared this with anybody and plan to dump it on my doctor soon."
Anxiety,Anxiety cuased by pain,What's the best way to get over this anytime I have pain I go into terrible panic attacks and it makes me feel like I cant even breath and between the pain and using  breathing techniques it's almost impossible to focus. I have really bad gerd and anytime it flares up my anxiety goes through the roof and between the chest pain from both I cant really focus on breathing and calming down
Anxiety,How to overcome anxiety when you’re about to give a presentation ?,"I did my first presentation ever, and I was okay before, I wasn’t anxious or anything I was literally fine. But the second the professor said to start all of a sudden it all kicked in, I couldn’t even talk I couldn’t remember what I was supposed to talk about, it was so obvious my voice was shaking, it’s so embarrassing goddddddddd I just want to cry."
Anxiety,Feeling lost and low,"Hey there ! 

I'm 20F , turning 21 in a month . Haven't been professionally diagnosed with anxiety , never been to therapy. I'm having a hard time feeling good. Usually it's just a day or two of feeling low and then back to normal . I always assumed it was a natural part of life and I was pretty good at getting hold of my emotions and calming down . But lately I've been feeling numb emotionally. I have a supportive family but my parents have their own differences and sometimes it's too exhausting to see them that way. I have a supportive boyfriend as well , but we don't meet very often due to the distance and there's not a lot we can do to make me feel better online. My grandfather passed away 3 years ago , and I still go through guilt about not being there enough for him. Over the past year I've felt detached from my friends as well . 
Sometimes I feel numb. For example, I might be talking about something pleasant to my boyfriend but it doesn't really feel like anything . Sometimes it makes my friends and family feel like there's nothing they can do for me .And I'm scared I'll upset people who are actually looking out for me if this continues. There are other things that probably affect how I'm feeling but I wouldn't want to make this post too long for now . I'm not sure if this is common and how to deal with it . 
Would appreciate any advice or similar experiences!Thanks ❤️"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get super bad performance anxiety?,"Do you ever feel immense pressure from other people that kind of makes you second guess yourself?

I could do something perfectly alone but having someone next tk me stressing me out makes me act completely idiotically."
Anxiety,Does drinking alcohol give you anxiety/panic attacks?,"I know that many people get anxiety and panic the next day, but I get very anxious when I get drunk. I always hear people say drinking and getting drunk helps with their anxiety but it seems to do the opposite for me. Any one else experience anxiety while under the influence of alcohol?"
Anxiety,Anxiety/Panic Attacks After Eating????,I’ve had this for the past two or so weeks now. After I eat I start having a lot of physical anxiety. Like my throat feels like it’s closing and I get close to a panic attack or end up having a full blown panic attack. The area around my tonsils or actual tonsils feel like it’s swelling but it’s not because I’ve had this sensation abunch during my panic attacks and it’ll feel hard to swallow or drink any water. I can’t randomly become allergic to all foods at 20 years old so is this common? It’s very scary to me and I’m concerned I have something rare… and is it normal to feel like my throats closing or “swelling” in the upper part by my jaw?
Anxiety,Anyone else get super depressed after the holidays? I have a really hard time coping with the new year,"I have ocd like badly, and I always go into a fairly deep depression after the holidays bc it flares up so badly. Christmas is my happy place and during that time I feel like I can finally fly and not have to fight, but then when the new year comes, everything hits me at once like a freaking earthquake and I find myself feeling completely lost and unable to process anything, I then end up dissociating constantly bc I don’t know how to cope even though I want to be present. There’s multiple reasons why the new year is very stressful for me and I know everyone’s different but I was just wondering if anyone struggles with this as well. Sometimes I feel like no one can relate and emotional pain sucks, it’s so hard to explain."
Anxiety,Anxiety Diarrhea,"I am a student currently going through endless floods of assessment and assessment triggers stomach pains and diarrhea almost every time. This often leads me to have a fluctuating diet and often feel unwell whenever I do my assessments; it always leaves me super exhausted, it drains every bit of energy out of me. As much as I want to ask for help and support from teachers from school (eg. giving breaks and letting me make up for the time lost), it's a bit TMI and I know they cannot accommodate for the time lost every time. What are some easy ways for me to ease this?"
Anxiety,I’ve been getting exceptionally more anxious and paranoid the past few days,"It’s been getting harder to sleep and I’m starting to get back into the delusion that somebody is in my closet watching me.

Anxiety,Waves of panic with physical symptoms for no reason,"A lot of the time I’ll get woken up by my anxiety (when ofc I wanted to stay asleep, it’s such a nuisance) n it’ll feel like I’m literally about to do a presentation or something 😂 n ofc my mind will start racing after


My chest will start to hurt n I’ll feel my legs and back getting tense AND BOIII THE STOMACH PAIN 


I can also start to feel anxious out of the blue at home when I’m relaxing on social media or something 


I know I definitely have social triggers but with this in mind, I think I may have GAD and not SAD. I’m currently going through the process of getting an anxiety disorder diagnosis so is this worth mentioning?"
Anxiety,Anxiety and Not Being Able to Sleep Tonight,"I was trying to sleep, but my mind was racing tonight. My mind was thinking about how I took so long in school and why I don't pursue careers that pay a decent amount of money. I tried to pursue what was a conventional career and ending up changing paths to a career which I feel passionate about, but which really does not pay enough. I think my biggest anxiety is whether or not I can make enough to live off on. Not sure what people here do about insomnia. My life story is a mixed one. It has taken me almost 10 years since high school to finish a bachelor's degree. During that time, I was working multiple jobs as well as doing internships. However, I have done 8 internships (paid+unpaid) in my field. The only thing is that I am nervous about having lost the earning potential from those years of being in school. The only positive thing I can say is that I will graduate with no debt and have savings. How do people overcome these thoughts? I used to use THC gummies to sleep when I had these issues, but I am having trouble getting them at the moment. Thank you!"

Anxiety,Not coping well with potential isolation/COVID positive result. Need some support and advice,"I've had anxiety my whole life and it's been particularly bad recently. 

Woke up this morning feeling a little off. 

Rapid at home test came back positive. Did another rapid 30 mins later which came back negative. I am double vaxxed and in my early 30's. 

Tried to get tested today but can't anywhere as testing sites are full where I live. This is only adding to the stress. The fact I'm hearing some people in have to wait 3+ days where I live for results has me more stressed. I should probably isolate from my partner who lives with me, even though I'm not 100% sure I've got COVID. 

I ruminate about the past a lot, and I've I'm COVID positive I know I will. ""Why did I go to this venue?"" ""I just shouldn't have gone to that restaurant"". 

The thought of being stuck at home for an extended period of time has me incredibly anxious and upset. I feel guilty that I am so anxious about it, because I know so many people have it worse. 

I'm just after some advice and support, that I am doing the right thing and many people in the world are going through this right now. I know it's not just me, but right now it feels like it's just me. 

Is anyone else in isolation or waiting for test results at home? How do you think I can cope with this situation better?"
Anxiety,Fear of going crazy,"I'm not sure what caused all of this. I always had some health anxiety, but nothing like this. Suddenly I started getting really bad anxiety attacks. Then things just spiraled out of control. I started hearing things when going to sleep or when waking up. My dreams are vivid with occasional nightmares. I immediately went for a mental health assessment at a Psych Center. They have to call their Psychiatrist after the assessment. They told me I had anxiety and sent me home. I went to a Hospital that has a Behavioral Health Unit. I was sent home saying that I had anxiety. Currently I'm struggling with the thoughts that I'm getting psychosis or schizophrenia schizophrenia. It's the symptoms when I try to sleep that concern me. I still function fine with work and other stuff."
Anxiety,Awake at half-past 4 am just stewing in the inconvenience that is having your card number stolen and having to reset everything on every account…,"Debit card info got stolen just before Xmas but juuuust after I had made two purchases, one of them over $200, that now need refunding. One business said since the bank account number didn’t change that even though the card that purchased the item is no longer valid, it should still make it to my account. This was 6 days ago…I figured give it the long weekend and see if it came through. So far, nada.

Now the big purchase, that’s really where the anxiety lies. It was two tickets to a comedy show that I had to request a refund for because the recipient got Covid. Venue is graciously offering refunds for Covid related reasons. Here’s the shit part: they’ve somehow issued the refund to a closed and inactive credit card. This is not even the DEBIT card I used to purchase it that is, as I stated previously, canceled. They literally, somehow???, processed a refund on a chase credit card that has been closed and fully inactive for over two years. I have no earthly idea how they got that card info, why it was processed to it, and why the fuck I wasn’t contacted when the original method of payment was no longer viable. 

Not even asking for advice here. Just venting. This is a lot of fucking money for me. No idea who to contact first to get it sorted but I’m stressed at the mere idea of sorting it out. Fucking money, man."
Anxiety,Ready to get on with the rest your life?,"Regardless of our past experiences, we all have the ability to live in the present. With time, effort and practice, we can make the most of each day to live our best lives.

These practices help us leave the past behind and live in the present:

**Accept the past.** Events have already happened. We can’t undo them. We can’t wish them away – that’s just physics! Now is the best time to acknowledge them, learn whatever can be learned from them and apply that learning to the present.    
    
**Recognize that your past doesn’t need to define you.**  Thinking that the future will automatically be the same as the past is a common limiting belief which we can challenge. Situations themselves do not define us – how we choose to respond to them does.

**Let go.** Sometimes easier said than done but entirely do-able. I guide most of my clients through a ‘letting go’ process which they can use whenever they wish thereafter.

**Take a look at your present life.** Taking stock of your health, family, relationships, home, personal development, career, leisure etc (in terms of whatever these things mean to you) provides a starting point.

**Create the life you want.** For each of these areas, decide how you would prefer them to be.

**Immerse yourself in each moment.** You’ve probably experienced the frustration and irritation of being involved in one activity while you’re actually thinking about something else. Develop the habit of asking yourself what is the most valuable thing you could be doing right now to progress towards one of your visions for the future.

**Check in with your emotions.** Reflect on how you feel. Are you energized? Is your mood melancholy? How do you feel about what you’re doing right now? Explore what you are learning from your reflections.  
   
 

**When you live in the present, doing what is most valuable to you, reflecting and learning, you will be on your way to living your best life.**"

She's been having issues with high blood pressure for years. They're going to make an ultrasound of her heart tomorrow. 

I'm terrified. One of my biggest issue is the fear of losing someone I love. But at the same time, I'm a hermit and three days I Christmas with my and my partners bubbly families exhausted me, so I skipped yesterday's tea at my parents'. I'm scared, feeling guilty and not ready for worse things. When my dad called me, he spoke in his ""Someone's dead"" voice at the beginning, until I teared up and asked if she's still alive. He then laughed and got cheerful. He usually never plays cheerful if he's sad or worried, so I hope he was sincere.

Anxiety,How do I get rid of a stalker?,"Im  a guy (mid 20's) and I work at a retail store. Since a month I have a  stalker. The thing is, it's an older man who lives with his girlfriend.  The man wants to know everything from me, and I mean everything! He  tries to get my address and phone number but I said no I don't give my  address and phone number. He was a bit offended because he said I am his  'friend'. Uhm... since when? We only talked a couple times in the  store. Also everyday he is contacting me via social media, sending me  messages and why I answer so late or not.

The  first time I met him I was polite and talked to him about different  stuff, like I do with many customers. But as soon as he asked for my  phone number and went a little pushy I started to give some hints that  it's fine to chat a little with him in the store, but not more. But the  hints didn't seem to work, he is getting pushier by the day!

Please  can someone help me? I am not that person that completely ignores  someone or getting rude, but I have to do something but I just don't  know what because I don't want to be rude.."

Anxiety,Father persistent cough and health decline,"My \[25M\] father \[69 M\] has had a persistent cough for the past \~1.5 years and it's starting to really concern me that he may not last much longer. I last visited a week ago, and he was having issues with dizziness while trying to get around the house and has generally been getting weaker and more erratic in behavior recently. I know everyone has to meet this fate at some point, but he's always been a model of health and it's way too early for me. I think the cough may be a result of lung cancer or COPD (he grew up with smoking parents). He also refuses to see the doctor, saying offhanded things like ""it's better for me to die sooner anyways to get a better return on life insurance"". It's putting a lot of strain on me emotionally and mentally since I don't have a whole lot of close family outside of my immediate family (mom and 2 brothers)."
Anxiety,How to quit my job due to my boss kind of being antivax,"So I’ve worked at a cafe for just over a year and in the last 3 months as vaccination mandates and safety measures have been put in place, I’ve noticed that my boss is really relaxed with getting people to wear masks, signing in with QR codes etc. 

My boss hasn’t flat out said she’s antivax but she’s allowing people who clearly are to come into the store and it’s been making me uncomfortable for a while. Covid cases are through the ROOF in my area at the moment and even though I can only get 1 shift a week there, I don’t know if it’s worth the risk (given a good chunk of their regulars are very antivax). 

I was originally gonna quit back in November but I kept putting it off because I hate feeling like I’m creating a hassle. I thought I should do the right thing and go into the cafe and tell her in person, but there’s a really high risk of transmission. Should I take the risk of going into the store in person or do it over text/call to be safer? I don’t know what I’d even say, she’s been really accommodating while I’ve worked there and I don’t want to make things difficult but I’m having to swallow my morals every time I go in there. 

(For further context - I’m incapable of confrontation, I’m terrified of making phone calls and I send texts/emails wherever possible. So this is a lovely situation lol)"
Anxiety,Sorry for this outburst.,"Hi. I don't really know Reddit and still don't understand well how to post here, so please forgive me if all of this seems weirdly awkward. Also, please forgive my english since it's not my native language.

I'm making this post because I hope reddit could become a safe place for me to freely express my feelings. I'm coping with really bad anxiety lately. My chest burns, and I have no one to talk about this. Whenever I try to start a conversation about how my anxiety is devouring me from the inside, I always feel misunderstood, ridicolized, or as if I'm playing the ""victim"". I am no victim. I'm just a person who doesn't know how to live properly. My mind doesn't cooperate with my body, my body doesn't cooperate with my mind. My brain is always overproductive, it runs so fast with thoughts that I don't even understand what it says to me. My body is always tired, it hurts everywhere; and still, it doesn't want to fall asleep at night. I can't even cry anymore. I feel like a ghost with a block too heavy on its chest. I just wish for someone to understand me and care for me. My family doesn't, neither my friends despite them being always there for me, but it's probably not their fault since they're not experiencing what I'm feeling. I'm terribly alone.

Sorry for this outburst."
Anxiety,Just wanted a hug one more time,"I just want a hug and to put my head on someone's shoulder but I won't have the chance for a while. There's nobody I just wanted a hug and to feel safe again. If I never started a relationship I wouldn't know what it's like to held just for it to be gone again. I miss it all. I just wanna cry in someone's lap but I'm a guy I can't ask for that. I just choke alot because it's even worth crying over anymore. Absolutely nobody I miss being happy now I'm back in my abusive house because of financial reasons. I just wanna go to sleep but I can't because arguing woke me up now sun's up. I don't even want to wake but I will to pretend I'm happy like normal so I don't worry anyone again. I don't even get hugs from my mom anymore I'm too old I guess. I know though that there's no point in hoping because you then you get your hopes up for nothing. I was literally a mistake that burdened my mom's life and now I'm just lonely. Nobody's gonna see this like usual and I feel like I'm dying inside daily. No matter what I do to make me happy this cloud returns. I just want it all to stop. I miss school and my friends graduation everything got worse than I got sick. I don't even know the point of this it's not like someone can help me but maybe I'll show a therapist if I even get the courage to go back because I ghosted them when they wanted to meet in person. I'm ready for the afterlife and this life is just horrid. Everyone's busy while I'm stuck trying to get happy so I can start my life. Meditation helps but it hurts too reflecting on all my mistakes by myself because theirs nobody. I because my own therapist and even I can see this patient ain't doing too hot. I'm tired,hungry, depressed sad, lonely,broke and mental illness is wrescking me. A wrestling icon of mine said something that just loops in my mind.

On the 8th day
God created Mankind
Why was He having such a bad day?!
Why did He created all of you normal
And forget some of the important parts of me?!
He made the teeth that I swallowed
The ear that was ripped from my skull
A face that no longer exists!!
Deep inside you are merely a mirror image
Of all my atrocities!!
The ugliness that exists outside
Lives inside every one of you!
(sobbing)
Destruction
CAN BE BEAUTIFUL!!!!

Anxiety,Anyone on fluvoxamine / luvox for OCD?,"Has it helped rumination, intrusive thoughts, anxiety and/or anything else ocd related?"
Anxiety,I’m drowning,"Lately I feel like I’m drowning with how bad my anxiety is. I’m in a perfect marriage, I have 2 perfect kids, I have a good job making good money but still I feel like any moment my world is going to crash down. Lately my anxiety has been tied a lot to work. Everyone is getting sick or getting fired and I feel like one of the two is about to happen to me. It’s so irrational because I haven’t done anything to warrant being fired and I can’t control if I get sick. I’m basically just spiraling in my own head and I’m scared that I’m going to accidentally self sabotage. Im having a hard time staying asleep and I’m constantly grinding my teeth. I just want all the negative thoughts to stop. Anyone with any advise on ways to get my anxiety to calm down? Medicine doesn’t really help."
Anxiety,Anxiety related to teeth and oral health,"I know health anxiety is common but has anyone been fixated on their teeth only.
I spend alot of time looking at my teeth daily to see any changes.
The things is that i overthink every spot on my teeth and freak out badly.
What i hate the most that it doesn't matter how much i take care of them, i don't  have 100% control over problems appearing and i really hate it.
Sometimes i think to myself, hopefully i will die before i find big problems with my teeth.
I know it's a weird way of thinking."
Anxiety,Work starts tomorrow again,"Might be a long post. 

The company I work for gave us a week-long holiday break and I'm grateful for that BUT I am so intimidated by the backlogs and new projects coming in when work starts again. I'm SOOO AWARE that I need challenges, to try something new, etc. and feedbacks are necessary for growth. I understand that completely. BUT IT JUST TERRIFIES ME SO BAD!!! 

There's a quote I read somewhere that says ""worry does not take away tomorrow's troubles, it takes away today's peace"" and it worked for me at time but somehow not today. Work's all I could think about. 

That's all thanks"
Anxiety,Best meds to but without doctors signiture for anxiety?,That i can buy it online natural or not
Anxiety,Really could use some reassurance,"Since I’ve last been on here I’ve been able to sleep more but the anxiety is still there before I go to sleep and when I wake up, my body is constantly thinking I’m gonna have seizure, (which I’ve never had before and am not prone to) due to just me seeing things when my eyes are closed and having constant throbbing headaches. and part of me knows I’m okay and it’s just anxiety but there’s still this part of me that’s in full panic mode. I don’t have anyone to relate to in real life about this, that’s mainly why I talk on here."
Anxiety,Something I guess,"I'm hungry I can't sleep because of arguing I've got 15 hours or so of sleep in 3 days. I just want to pass peacefully. I've already discussed my will but bring it up in nonchalant ways. I've went from 220 to 160 and literally pulling hair out like alot more than I'd like to admit. I'm actually scared to get a haircut because I'm worried their will be bald spots. Its like I'm just a game piece to be thrown to the side. I'm eating once a day if I'm lucky or snacking throughout. It's almost funny to watch myself die and nobody else seems to care so why should I is how I feel right now. My stomach is cramping my eyes hurt but light out now. Hope is dwindling to me. I miss the better days. Before the fights, my dad and Nana passing. My friends moving away or growing distance. I wanna see him again just to remember more what he was like. There's so much he never got to tell me next year will be my 21st and he can't even drink with me. I hope he's doing OK. Look at me pretending he's still here to feel better. He's gone and it won't ever change"
Anxiety,My Worst holidays ever in terms of mental health (and first post ever on Reddit),"So I have been dealing with anxiety for a few years now. I suspect it being fear of failure since I am such a perfectionist. I'm a student (23M) and I have been in therapy for a about 7 month now. But things are getting worst and worst as I am navigating thought the academic year... EVERYTHING   is overwhelming for me, relations with my family, my actual friends, keeping contact with close friends, even my passions ... because I am way too ambitious. Holidays have always been the most difficult part because each time I expect to sort my life in order in every aspect and each time It ends up being such a disappointment. I'm anxious, do nothing, time passes by and I'm getting more anxious, then it becomes even harder to do something. 

But this time it is straight hell. I spent the holydays with my mom (she lives alone). I have not been able to help her in 2 weeks straight even now she is lightly disabled (hemiplegy) and is recovering from an elbow injury. She has been cooking and doing laundry the whole time for me and I am 23 and feel like a wreck. 

But the thing for which I am completely freaking out right now is that I have 8 exams in the following 2 weeks on very difficult topics, I have lost a lot a self confidence and have not studied AT ALL for those because anxiety freezes me. I just don't know how I am getting out of this. 

Also, even know my mom knows about my mental disorders, I have a very hard time speaking with her and explaining because I don't even understand the issue. 2nd reason being that my sister is also experiencing pretty violent anxiety episodes and we have a strong History of mental issues in my family and I don't want to make her even more worried. 

To synthesize, I've spent the whole holydays fleeing from my studies, my role as a son, my friends, my futur (ie looking for internships) And all my actions have been the exact opposite of What I want to do. Now I just want to cry for 30 minutes and unload to my mother before taking the train back to uni but can't even seem to be able for some reason.

(Sorry if the language is incorrect I am not completely fluent in English)"
Anxiety,Health anxiety and headaches.,"Does anyone else with health anxiety or any other anxiety for that matter have headaches that come with it? 

My fear for health anxiety is of being dizzy and fainting. It’s what most things centre around with my worry. It’s stupid because I know having a headache isn’t going to cause me any harm. It’s due to stress and my anxiety causing me to be tense. 

How do you cope with the above?"
Anxiety,Has exposure therapy ever backfired?,And if so what is the story?
Anxiety,"I dread people replying to ""controversial"" comments or posts of mine on reddit, tiktok, etc.","I put quotes around controversial because, it's usually about stuff that isn't even serious, like opinions on video game related stuff or something, but I know that people will take it seriously, everyone on the internet is so hostile and mean."
Anxiety,Will 25mg Amitriptyline once a day helps with anxiety symptoms?,Do you have experience with treating GAD with amitriptyline?
Anxiety,"Health anxiety :,)",I’ve been having a rough week and I feel like I literally forget how to breathe. Either I stop breathing or when I do I feel like I’m not getting enough air and it’s really affecting my quality of life. It worries me a lot bc it’s constant from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep because of exhaustion. Sometimes I get a few minutes of relief but it’s hard to not worry about it. I just want to get better. It’s been 2 years since it got really bad and I haven’t been the same since.
Anxiety,I'm really scared about my returning anxiety.,"It's been 3 years since I started taking meds for anxiety (escilatopram and lexotan). After 3 good years, the last 3 months have been a pain, especially at night. stings in my heart, constantly hearing the beating of my heart, slight head pressure. However I know it was anxiety and I could manage it...until last night. A very sharp chest pain came and wouldn't go away for like 40min. I started to panic and had to go to ER to get checked. I thought I was going to die. All exames and blood work came back negative. 

The doctor told me that I might need to change my prescription of meds and try something new, that maybe my body is already used to these meds and they are not working anymore. 

I am scared to death about this, Im still young (40) and I don't want to live in this state anymore. I feel this is changing me for a worse person. I guess, I just want to know if someone had a similar experience because I feel completely alone. Thank you for reading this."
Anxiety,We were discussing and my anxiety is triggered…,"Me and husband are in a LDR…

It was tough especially that i have anxious attachment and he is avoidant.

We were discussing about cheating and affair, it was brought up coz he has a hunch his cousin is having an affair with a married man…

My anxiety was triggered all of a sudden and i am having these thoughts that he might be doing the same etc. although, i don’t find any reason he would do it. He has been faithful and loyal to me.

I hate myself for thinking like this about him,. I don’t want to have this anxiety and all because i know next to this is an extreme overthinking.

I have been struggling with this. It come and goes. 

I hope i can overcome it today.."
Anxiety,I give up :(,"I can’t take this anxiety anymore for 2 years i haven’t been able to go to the supermarket that is literally across the street, i can’t stand this i cant even shower , i get mixed response from family when i ask about medication, i cant handle it , it seems too hard i tried my best but i just can’t anymore"
Anxiety,Struggling with symptoms,"This is hard to write while staying calm but I need to put myself into words and hear encouragement from others so I'll give it a shot.

Ive always had anxiety but lately I've had random panic attacks. I  was on celexa but started buspirone as my doctor said it tends to work better for anxiety. As soon as I took the new medicine (on thurs) I panicked. I get so nervous trying anything new but this was worse.

 I've been taking 5mg day/night the past 3 days and it's been awful. Nauseous, chills, shaking, dizzy, disassociating.. I've taken lorazepam to ground me again. I can't tell if it's side effects or my brain causing symptoms, either way I feel I'm losing touch with reality. 

Since it's the holiday/weekend noone is available. I stopped the buspirone this morning and I have less symptoms but I'm now constantly afraid of them coming back. 

I'm going to talk with my doctor to go back on celexa (maybe a higher dose) but how can I survive this until tomorrow??"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get really anxious about social media?,I get anxious when I post anything. Especially if I post drinking pics. Can anyone else relate?
Anxiety,I think I was able to pinpoint the source of today's attack. ( NSFW ),"Last night, I thought to myself, "" I wonder what it's like to pay for porn? ""
I decided to subscribe to EvilAngel.
I was having the time of my life watching all of the new releases that aren't on PornHub yet. 
It cost 9.95 a month.
I learned today that after the first month it gets more expensive.
I also have Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Prime subscriptions so I started to worry about the price going forward.
The idea that I might lose access to the new releases frightened me.
It was the fear of losing the new releases that got triggered me and I'm doing better since I've realised that.
I love it, but if I can't pay, I can't pay.
There's still PornHub."
Anxiety,I finally fully told my parents after having another Benzo binge,"My father thinks mental health problems don't exist, I think I changed their mindset a little bit with all of the terrible shit I did.

But anyways, I talked with my family about my issues and how I need help.( Only because I was full on benzos.) My strategy so far was to self medicate with alcohol, unprescribed benzos and a whole lot of other shit.

Now, of course I didn't want to talk to them about this, but I screwed up too many times with benzos and they wanted to know what happened.

And in my drugged up state of mind, gave them the whole story. How I have anxiety and depression. How I also don't have much hope in treatment being successful. I don't think I told them how suicidal I am. Probably wouldn't helped the discussion.
I was expecting the worst. Last time I talked about my anxiety was, when I was brought to the ER for collapsing on the bathroom floor because of Benzo withdrawal. There my father thought the solution to my problem was to just not let me do anything fun anymore and only concentrate on university work.

But the response was positive. My parents told me, that it can't keep going like this. But not in the toughen up way. They now want to get me help with psychiatrists and other professionals. They were actually understanding, probably because they see how much I'm suffering.

Sorry for the rant. I was just so pleasently surprised by a lot of this. I was expecting the absolute worst. With a dad who doesn't believe in mental illness. Only my mother has experience with anxiety, because her mother had it, but she doesn't think of her mother's anxiety as anything more than a quirk.

Now to the awful search of a good doctor. One who doesn't pick up the phone and two who tell. Their patients to toughen up are out of the question. Sadly the only ones that are less that half an hour of drive away.

TL:TR: parents who don't understand mental health, still want to help me get help after years of self medication and self destruction

P.s. I'm still a little high. Not crazy high, my vision is blurry still. Hard to write a text like this right now. Thanks for bearing with me."
Anxiety,I have pretty bad social media anxiety?,"Whenever I post something I worry about what the responses would be and how people would react to it, I don't know if this is a bad thing.   
do you think I should Stop social media to work on the anxiety? Not sure"
Anxiety,My First Anxiety Attack of 2022,"I woke up way too early because I think I started processing all the things I need to do in the next few weeks. And the catastrophization kicks in, dooming every effort to failure in my head before I even get started. All these contingencies are too much for me. Took my first Ativan in 6 weeks."
Anxiety,"do you believe love is a choice? if no, what do you believe is","i am guessing that there isnt one true defintion of love. correct me if i am wrong 

i recently listened to what will smith said about love on youtube and this is how he defines it

&amp;#x200B;

 

At it’s core, Love is help. everyone is having a hard time, so Love is devotion to their struggle. Its when you are committed to helping someone with their life. Helping them to suffer less, helping them to manage their minds and their emotions. Love is a deep desire for our loved ones growth, their blossoming , and their all around well being. When you love someone .you  want them to feel good. You want them to succeed in life. You want them to be happy. Love really demands an in-depth understanding of their hopes, dreams , fears , needs, and their traumas . Love is giving and sharing our gifts for the purpose of nurturing them , empowering them, and helping them to create their greatest joys.

what are your thoughts and feelings to what will has shared? i like what he says

i dont have all the information on this but will smith has cheated on his partner before. i think its okay to listen to what hes saying because i have cheated before, accepted my wrongs, and i changed for the better and i understand more about myself and things than i did when i was cheating.

i hope everyone is having a safe positive day"
Anxiety,Doctor said I have mild anxiety. I don’t know if I believe him,"So I went to a doctor awhile back because I feel like I’ve been feeling fairly depressed and suffering from anxiety for at least two years. I basically told what I’d been going through, that my depression comes in “waves.” Either every other week or every few days. And I told him that sometimes I’ll have moments where out of nowhere I’ll feel euphoric and I think yeah everything’s gonna be alright but that feeling usually fades I go back to feeling however I was feeling either that or pretty low.

And I won’t go into too much detail but these past few years have sucked. Aside from Covid I’ve just had some real bad luck and can’t seem to catch a break.

As far as my anxiety I told him that I bite my nails, I chew the inside of my lip to a point where it sometimes bleeds and I’ve had panic attacks as well as having moments where I’m laying in bed or on the couch and feel paralyzed because of my anxiety, my chest tightens and I’m too afraid to move but feel guilty doing nothing, which can make my anxiety worse. 

Anyways I’m mainly making this post because I kind of disagree with the doctor but I’m also disappointed in the process. Before I went I had to fill out ten or so simple questions about my anxiety and depression. When I got there I had to fill out basically the same questions then I went over the questions with the doctor’s assistant or someone and then I went over the questions again with the doctor. Anytime I tried to go a little more in-depth in my answer they didn’t seem to listen and were too focused on the next question and getting through them. 

After I left I felt somewhat better but in the follow days I felt like I’d been tricked by both myself and the doctor. I know it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get a second opinion but it took a lot out of me to acknowledge what I’d been going through and to go to the doctor to deal with it and I just felt so discouraged afterwards because I felt maybe I hadn’t expressed myself well enough, because I think my anxiety is more than just mild."
Anxiety,Anxiety and unable to eat,"I have recurrent anxiety mostly being caused when my partner is in some kind of problem. Once I start having some anxiety I fear that I'll vomit anything that I eat. This is because I have done so in the past when forcing myself to eat with anxiety. This is affecting my sleep as well, I wake up earlier due to anxiety. Nausea in the morning is a common thing. Though I am fully aware of my anxiety disorder for 2-3 years, I am not able to find a resource that explains the causes and potential solutions. I am also thinking of going through therapy and CBT to check if that helps. 

I am looking for some relevant data on anxiety/nausea/eating-disorder, anecdotal evidence(Reddit posts) and potential solutions. Please help, thank you."
Anxiety,Feeling weird opening your mouth and talking to strangers,"Hi! I wanted to know if some people here have trouble (or can't) talking to strangers, even to say ""hello""?

I'm so quiet that I probably give the impression of being mute, or making people uncomfortable, but I have a lot of trouble starting a conversation or talking in a group (or even if it's just 2 of us).

Sometimes I want to talk, but my fucking voice tells me ""hey, shut up, you'll never socialize, no one cares about your opinion"".

I've been taking an antidepressant for 9 weeks, but it hasn't changed anything, I don't understand anything...

Is anyone here the same?"
Anxiety,Medicine change,"So I have to change my medication this year from being on 40mg of Lexapro since 2018 to a combo medications of clonazepam and Venlafaxine. 

I just feel so out of control, my Lexapro isn’t working anymore and I know I need to change but it was a big deal for me to go on meds in the first place. 

My mum really helped me through it and supported me. But she passed away in April and now I feel afraid because I don’t have my person to help me feel safe. 

So if anyone has any advice about changing meds or anything helpful that would be amazing 💗"
Anxiety,Have a Safe Flight! Lofi Airplane Mode with Lofi Hip Hop Music,[removed]
Anxiety,I dont think my anti depressants are working for my anxiety. I'm going to talk to my doctor next week anyone who has changed anti depressants do you wean off the old one first or does starting a new one prevent horrible withdrawal symptoms,"If this sounds like a medical question I don't mean it be but Google seems a little short on answers. And I've been on my medication since August, I'd hate to have to wind it down for two months and then start something new that would take 2 months to see an effect but if thats the case I better prepare for it and wanted to know if that's been the case for you guys."
Anxiety,Why do doctors lie?!,"So I was given SSRI to take and I was having real trouble with side effects and the way everyone was saying how they take weeks and months to settle and start working.

So I called my GP and asked is there anything else that can work short term for me just to give me a break so I can calm down a little and regroup.

And she was basically ""no. There's nothing. 2 weeks on sertraline and you'll be golden."" And it's such bullshit.

Because once I've dropped the SSRI and calmed down a bit I looked stuff up and found out about beta blockers and benzos. 

I understand benzos have issues but why not say ""these exist as a last resort and there are also beta blockers that would help the physical symptoms but not mental"". 

I'm anxious, I'm not stupid! 😠"
Anxiety,"Off Zoloft for a year, anxiety and depression are spiralling out of control. Don't know what to do- need help"," 

I withdrew from Zoloft in march 2020 after having taken it for 2 years. The best thing it did for me was stop me from dissociating and give me more confidence. I've reverted back to those behaviours at full tilt. I can't engage in conversations anymore, be present in the moment, and the constant negative self-talk is back, which is crippling and stops me from doing anything. Thinking I'm disgusting, useless, stupid, annoying, ugly all the time. Zoloft has made me realise how chronic all these behaviours are in me. I literally dissociate 24/7 and have done for the decade and a half that I've been living with depression. It impedes cognitive functioning so much- can't hold onto a thought and follow it through, can't react to or engage with what people are saying to me. I also can't sleep at all - I've developed insomnia which I never had before Zoloft, which made me pass out like a baby.

The dose I was on stopped being effective towards the end so I withdrew rather than upping my dose. It was so fucking hard coming off the first time, but I don't know what else to do but go back on Zoloft.

Or has anyone tried any other useful meds? (I can't afford therapy)"

Anxiety,Need reassurance - derealization/depersonalization feelings,"Hi. I have been diagnosed with GAD/Panic Disorder/OCD. My main GAD symptom is feelings of derealization/depersonalizaiton. I hate this. My mind is trying to tell me that I am going crazy and that these feelings will never go away, that I am going to lose myself and my reality, etc, even thought I KNOW that is not true the thoughts keep on coming and I feel like I am stuck in a feedback loop of these thoughts. I could use some reassurance that these are normal anxiety symptoms and will pass soon."
Anxiety,Wine makes me feel terrible. Other alcohols are ok.,I don’t drink much these days and when I do it’s only 1 or 2 drinks otherwise I’ll be at high risk of a panic attack the next day.

Anxiety,My dad is shaming me for doing panic attacks.,This is overwhelming
Anxiety,Nighttime physical anxiety,"I've been having some pretty random anxiety issues over the past few years, and was wondering if anyone had similar experiences or thoughts.  Basically, sometimes at night (maybe 5-6 times a year?), I will feel wide awake, and get panicked when I try to lie down to sleep.  Not just insomnia, where I just can't sleep, but I get very focused on my breathing, and feel sort of claustrophobia.  It comes on suddenly.  I don't usually feel anxious UNTIL I lie down.

If I get up, and go for a walk outside, I feel better, but the feeling returns once I try to lie down, usually until I'm very exhausted, and then can actually sleep.  There aren't really ""thoughts"" associated with it (like, I'm not specifically worried about work or personal problems), just a acute awareness of being ""trapped"" in my body, if that makes sense.

It seems to happen fairly randomly, but there are some patterns - it's much more likely to happen if I'm congested with a cold or something like that.  It seems to happen almost exclusively in winter.  And it rarely happens multiple days in a row, even if I'm still sick with the cold.  I've found decongestants (Afrin, since I figured sudafed could make it worse) helpful, but not a 100% fix, and it sometimes happens without congestion.

Thanks in advance for any pointers or direction!"
Anxiety,Coming back to the “real world” after vacation,"I am very stressed, which hurts my stomach a lot, because we have a late flight home tonight. I have to drive 2+ hours back to my house after that and won’t get home until very late. I have to wake up early for work tomorrow.

Anxiety,SHARP chest pain on the left side before anxiety attack,"I’ve lived with anxiety since I was 16, and sometimes I get these sharp chest pain on my left side. (4 times a year), Is it normal to get those and then after it happens my heart beats fast and I get scared and sudden anxiety is all over me. :("
Anxiety,My financial anxiety isn’t normal,"I grew up working class and my dad was never home. I never saw him because he was working, and my mom stayed home because it was cheaper than a babysitter. We went to Florida when I was 7 or 8 with family friends who were well off and I remember their mother saying something about how we couldn’t afford the trip, going out to dinner, etc. My sister and I had hand-me-downs or garage sale clothes, but we were happy kids. It was 3 bedrooms and spaghetti every night, but I wasn’t worried. 

Fast forward to now. I’m 19, a full-time college student and working full-time because I’m too anxious about my future becoming the past. My parents are better off now and I have said they don’t need me to work. They are paying my tuition. They pay my sister’s rent and for her groceries, but I don’t let anybody support me. I can’t because I remember the past and don’t want my parents to be stressed about money again. I want to be so independent that word never comes out I needed help with money. I sold my favorite model horse collection and most of my thinhs so I could buy textbooks for myself and put the rest in savings. I’ve considered getting a second job. I really once thought about prostitution. 

I don’t even want to be rich. I’m just scared of being broke and alone. I’m medicated for my major depression but I don’t have an anxiety problem except for this. Just venting!"
Anxiety,What job do you have and does it affect your anxiety?,I posted on here that my anxiety makes it very hard for me to work and be independent. The jobs I’ve had don’t do well with my anxiety (talking to angry customers all day and getting yelled at) it doesn’t really help it just makes it worse for me. I’m tired of going job to job to find it’s the same. I understand and just about every job you are interacting with customers. I need something more relax that isn’t so much front facing. I don’t have a degree so that’s on me but I have to have a job. Tell me about your job and if it affects your anxiety or not. If you have any suggestions please let me know.
Anxiety,Can someone tell me what this means?,"Recently I've been having issues with my stomach. Like a month or two ago it felt super bloated and hard and I had lower right abdominal pain here and there. I don't have it anymore but last night I ate almost an entire bag of white cheddar popcorn and afterwards I had two soft bowel movements and my stomach felt a tiny bit bloated again along with the pain in my lower right abdomen again. Mind you, before I ate the popcorn I felt fine. What could this mean?"
Anxiety,"Anxiety, Stress or Depression?","Hi Guys, I've created this new account so I can post on reddits that my friends won't know its me. So I'm looking for some advice.

 Anxiety and Depression aswell as issues with stress control runs In my dads side of the family. Over the past few years where I was forced by my parents to take part in out of school activities which I didn't want to do. This made me really stressed out and anxious through my younger years which makes me think that this is why I am the way I am now. I've been to school counselling because I couldn't cope with the stress and anxiety of exams but nothing much was done. 

I'm starting to think that anxiety and depression are in genetics. I'm going to work in just under and hour and I'm really anxious about it (not sure why) but it also feels like I'm in some state of depression. I'm sat down doing absolutely nothing knowing I have work and counting the hours go by. I can even sit down and play some games to relax and enjoy today. 

Does anyone here have similar issues to this?
Should I consider going to the doctor and try to find out if I have any of the metal health issues? 

Thanks everyone.

Happy new year.

Anxiety,Scared,"I only smoked for 5 months, I quit in September and ever since then, I've had issues with my health. First started out with chest tightness, that went away after a month, but for the past 3 months, I wake up every single morning with a sore throat and like I have sinus drainage. My sense of smell and taste has also been affected as well. Chicken, my urine and fecal matter also smell off. I've also been losing weight faster than usual. My lymphnode on the back of my neck is swollen.. I went to the ENT and they said my sinuses and throat look normal. I'm scared that I may have some form of cancer that I am unaware of but starting to show early stages. I don't know what to do. or any advice?"
Anxiety,Anxiety driven heartburn?,"Hi,

I’ve had heartburn for almost 2 months now. Doctors suspect it’s because of high stress and anxiety. I am burned out at the moment so that is likely. 

Are there others who have heartburn/GERD symptoms because of anxiety? 

It’s weird as I’ve never had this even though I’ve had anxiety before for years. I am having a call with doctor in couple of weeks to ask again. I am afraid it’s something serious.."
Anxiety,Having a panic/anxiety attack right now.,"I am on my bed and I am having an anxiety attack. I have 2 exams in 7 and 8 days respectively and I haven’t studied anything the last 5-6 weeks (the courses are both 6 weeks long) and I am freaking out. I am having a fight or flight response and I am looking at ways to run away and skip the exams, I am looking if these courses are requirements for future courses. Do you think I can study sufficiente for a passing grade in 7 week? 😥"
Anxiety,"having constant anxiety is soul crushing, i don’t know how long i can take this anymore..",
Anxiety,I understand it's not safe to suddenly stop taking bisoprolol...but is it ok to switch to propranolol...are they similar enough in their mechanism?,
Anxiety,Urgent need to feel pain,"First of all I need to say that I am not suicidal and you dont need to worry about that kind of things.

So, I was watching some porn and masturbating when I had this feeling that I really need to feel some pain. I found myself thinking where I could do the cuts without my husband noticing. Last minute I stopped, already had knife on my hand.

I dont have history of cutting myself. My anxiety went pretty bad last year and I managed to get help in december. 

Not sure what I wanted with this post, I think I just startled the situation."
Anxiety,"I am sick with COVID, can I have some happy thoughts please?","I am double vaxxed, healthy 30 yo. I know, logically, I will be fine but my brain is catastrophizing...I know realistically more people have recovered than have died. I will be okay even if it's hard to believe in the moment."
Anxiety,Anxiety and epilepsy?,I have extreme levels of anxiety due to Asperger’s syndrome. For quite sometime this manifested in very physiological ways. Blood pressure and uncontrollable vomiting/acid reflux. I’ve been sent to the hospital before for vomiting blood clots. In 2017 ish after I fell into psychosis from untreated anxiety I began to develop browning out episodes that have been diagnosed as some form of epilepsy. Essentially my brain on anxiety is almost like a computer opening too many tabs and it just shuts down for 30 sec. Has anyone else been diagnosed epileptic due to anxiety? Seizure meds do not seem to make a difference.
Anxiety,Tonsils Swelling Feeling/Throat Closing During Panic Attack,I’ve had this happening a lot recently during my panic attacks. Best way to explain is it feels like my tonsils are swelling and gonna close my throat and I’m gonna stop breathing. This happens after eating as of recently from fear of it being an allergic reaction. I can actually feel it and it feels like a tiny little ball on each side of the jaw under it. basically right where my tonsils are. Has this anxiety symptom happen to anyone else? this feelings came on and of even before my anxiety about eating.
Anxiety,Hating myself,"What do I do when I hate myself and no matter how much I change, I only keep worrying? I keep thinking that I bother all my friends and that I’m obnoxious and say stupid things sometimes. I don’t know what to do to change myself and I feel this out of anxiety up and it becomes a massive panic attack, with a parent telling me that by commenting on these things she is enabling this ‘behaviour’ even though I feel so sick sometimes with anxiety I feel like I can’t cope. I’ve also struggled for years with confidence. Any advice?"
Anxiety,idk,"I’m so tired , I haven’t slept all night bcuz I just keep thinking about my breathing too much and my brain just keeps telling me I can’t breath or I’ll forget how to breathe which makes me panic causing me to not sleep especially if I start feeling palpitations or my chest feels tight. It’s 10am and I can’t stop overthinking :( I haven’t got good sleep in so long bcuz of my anxiety and I hate it. Even if I do sleep I’ll wake up already feeling anxious which is so annoying, I’m literally never calm."
Anxiety,Do you ever feel that your breathing is suddenly shallow and then you can’t catch a deep breath?,"How do I fix this? I get stuck in shallow breathing in my chest, and can’t manage to get a deep full breath in. It’s almost like focusing on it makes it even worse. And my chest hurts. I know it’s based in anxiety but there’s nothing on my mind. I’ve tried breathing techniques but they’ve actually made it worse in the past. I just hate this feeling and it keeps happening to me everyday! It makes me so dizzy too. Any advice? Would be so grateful"
Anxiety,"Woke up with the worst feeling of anxiety, telling myself it's okay and meditating but what else can I do?",I have been feeling a lot anxious lately which has been triggered due to certain incidents with no control over my thoughts. Last night I decided to start practicing meditation and I did the same this person. The feeling of that I am going to be broke and alone in life sinking with more horrible thoughts coming in my way. I cannot see a therapist due to certain financial reasons so I am wondering if there is anything I can do right now to help me feel calm.
Anxiety,Is ok to be watching cartoons at 15?,"I feel like I’m too old to be watching the amazing world of gumball, adventure time, avatar, etc. alone. I beat myself up about it everyday, wondering if I’m too childish for a 15 year old. 
Plus, I’m not in drivers Ed, and most of my friends are, which makes me anxious about how I’m going to grow up. Should I be watching cartoons? Is all this normal? Should I be beating myself up about this?"
Anxiety,I really need get this off my chest and let out my frustrated and anger and rage and back myself up I'm really fed up with people sending me death threats and calling me horrible names and saying horrible terrible evil stuff I really hope y'all understand please don't keep sending me death threats,[removed]
Anxiety,Dementophobia / scared ill start hearing voices,"I've never heard any voices, and to my knowledge, I only suffer from anxiety and depression so I don't think it's gonna happen, but still, just the mere thought of it freaks me out like crazy!

I think what triggered my anxiety many years ago was to learn that my grandad has some very severe illness, not sure what, be he has never worked, been locked up, talking to aliens, etc, though, in all my 30years of being alive, he has been medicated and completely rational and normal though in early retirement. But just the thought that whatever he had/has could be hereditary.... Ugggggh I'm too scared to ask what it is because I know ill look it up and if there is a chance it's hereditary my anxiety will only get worse...

Imagine hearing malicious voices in your head that you can't escape, must be what hell is like...

Does anyone else who has this fear and have some tips on how to deal with it?

On any normal day, I rationale laugh at it, but when the anxiety hits me, I feel like I'm just one wrong thought away from the voices starting."
Anxiety,I feel like utter crap. Maybe TW,"
I feel like I'm never gonna have a good life. I feel like I'm just a burden and a disappointment. I feel so envious of people who have a normal life and a normal mind. Ik everyone has their own struggles but it feels like having anxiety is like living hell. I feel so sad cz my life quality will never measure up to those who are normal. 
I can't drive, I can't take up challenges, I can't get stressed even a tiny bit, all because of my anxiety. 
It feels like the entire universe is against me. 
I have made so much progress the past year and worked my ass off to get a hang of my anxiety, but I still feel like I'll have a crappy life. 

I'm not good looking, not that smart, I don't feel good about myself and at this point of time I don't enjoy anything and I don't think I ever will. 

I hate everyone and everything. 

Please tell me there's hope."
Anxiety,Im really sorry about huge rants and amount of spam I apologise I really need get lots off my chest and let out my frustrated and anger and rage I hope y'all understand I'm not on here for attention or sympathy or followers Im only on here for support and closure and people listen to my posts,[removed]
Anxiety,I hate having Anxiety.,"I am really struggling right now with my anxiety due to school, friend problems, and my Dad having cancer, please help me with 
how I can feel better. I just feel like I’m stuck in a hole and nothing can help me. I dread almost every aspect of my life except going to work because I like my job. I’ve found myself staying home from school more and more and my grades are starting to slip. I just don’t know what to do. I hate having Anxiety and no one around me seems to understand me. My mom doesn’t seem to think Anxiety is such a big deal but it is. Any advice?"
Anxiety,A bad first date,"So i went on a date the other day and had a few too many, i know nothing awful happened but i’m worried that i really embarrassed myself, like i dropped my phone at the bar and then couldn’t use my key to get into my own house. But he’s asked me on another date so why can’t i stop overthinking? because him asking me out again is proof nothing awful happened"
Anxiety,Anxiety over talking to boss,"[Warning: foul language]

I fucked up at work, not like a huge major way but I used the cake air brush tool which I forgot I wasn't supposed to use. Last time I used it was months ago. So Wednesday night I used it by mistake and made cupcakes which I forgot was a big no because we save on shipment. My ADD is pretty bad and it happens, I forget. I made two sets of 6 count cupcakes to put up at the case. 

Apparently I forgot to clean out the nozzle and it leaked into the sink, thank god not on the floor. It started getting busy and usually little shit like restocking the condiments slips my mind because it gets a bit hectic at night [I'm the only closer.]

I wake up to my boss slamming me in the group chat... 

""Absolutely NO ONE us to use the airbrush unless given permission this was left this way over night which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!!""

first off.. I apologized but why the group text? Why didn't she message me privately and told me if I did it again I would be written up? So that kind of pissed me off, but, when I saw her at work her attitude was a bit off with me and I continued to apologize. 

Well now... later on I notice I missed a message from her talking about how we cannot use the tools and cupcakes... then another message which really fucking set me off

""I just sent her that. And yea I don't care. I am so frustrated right now.""""

so she was talking being my back. She seemed to have accidently sent it to me. 

This doesn't seem right and tomorrow I will see if the store boss is in and bring it up to her. I don't care if I get fired I just.. fuck man...

look I am very sorry I was told before and fucked up using it at work but what the hell? None of this seems right. I notice too I'm always left out a bit in the group chats, and when I said I was sick on thanksgiving and shit no one cared. Petty of me but.. come on. 

I feel like its one coworker who is..talking. She told me the breader looks like shit after cleaning it, yet, last time she cleaned it, it looked like shit. I'm going to look for a new job in the mean time in case something happens because I cannot afford to lose a job and be stuck on rent. ugh...

I'm scared to talk to store boss and get every one on my bad side."
Anxiety,This is definitely my last good night message and vent and rant for tonight yes I mean it too sorry about huge rants and amount of spam I apologise a lot I'm very sorry too don't send me any death threats I'm not looking for attention or sympathy or followers I'm not attention seeker or troll,[removed]
Anxiety,Wondering about work,"alright so Im 18 and not in post secondary but i want to be as soon as possible. Im about to finish my 2nd week of work and Im thinking about quitting, theres this one job that isnt advertising any open positions but I really want to shoot my shot there, it would cut by commute in half and would let me avoid a bus stop that causes me a lot of anxiety. thing is in the low chance that i am contacted for an interview they most likely will ask my availability and I cant say anytime even though that might improve my chances of being hired because I'd have to leave my 2 weeks notice at my current job. Now ill have to explain why im looking for work after only 2 weeks. my current job also pays by cheque so i dont think i can just ghost them. what would you guys do"
Anxiety,One Day,"Most of the time it is being in bed thinking about a message you sent to a friend or a coworker that they didn’t respond to. While your brain tells you how they feel about you, that they just don’t like you. 

Then comes a day later, and there is a repose, and you sit, paralyzed, trying to think of the next thing to say, and hope the cycle doesn’t repeat. All for a conversation you are not even interested in. 

Some days I feel the little anxiety’s have transitioned from meaningless interactions into my core decision making process. Like a parasite slowly taking energy from me while it grows stronger. 

No longer do I worry about simple things, now I worry about the people around me. My family, my friends, the woman I love. 

Now I fear I cannot make a decisions about how I feel about others because I am constantly more concerned with how they feel about me. 

I ask myself, when did I become so distrusting? So cynical? And I point to a few common life events from my past and label them as “the reason why.” 

But they’re not are the reason why, are they?

My college girlfriend of 3 months cheating on me surely should not impact how I trust the woman I have loved for two years. 

My getting made fun for my appearance as a kid surely should not impact how I think a new person sees me today. 

And certainly I am not the same person who experienced those things so why should I react the same way I did then?

My past life events are apart of me but I I let them impart on me far too much. 

I think that’s what anxiety is to me. The ferociousness of my own memories. Until they consume me. Until I convince myself what happened the will surely happen again. 

But the beauty of this life is it is full of surprises. For better or for worse. So no matter what just decide to try again. And again. To be better. And then one day, before you know it, we will all rest easy."
Anxiety,Anxiety makes me panick to go to doctors but sometimes also makes me not trust them?,"Hi. 21F here. Since last month I have been facing some health issues which makes me panick all the time, every time I feel smallest thing weird in my body. I feel panicked and want to go to doctors, I feel good for a while by having the issue addressed but after a day or two I start obsessing over if doctors diagnosed me properly or if their meds are working or if they prescribed the right meds or not, feel afraid of taking certain medications fearing they might have a adverse reaction. Does this sound like health anxiety? If yes, how can I deal with it? It's causing me a lot of stress :("
Anxiety,Do I need to get a rabies shot,"I live in a kind of rural area where there are a lot of animals. Earlier I went to go take my garbage out to the dumpster and the lid was shut, so i had to open it to toss my garbage in (this was at night time by the way). Right afterwards I touched my phone without washing my hands. Then I thought, what if an animal with rabies was touching that garbage can, and I touched it and got the rabies virus all over my phone, clothes, and every other part of me? I washed my hands then but I'm still worried.

Is this just my anxiety or should I be worried?"
Anxiety,this is my life,[removed]
Anxiety,Really fucking struggling 😞,"Feeling hopeless, I just dont know what to do but i know that i dont want to suffer anymore....."
Anxiety,Movies and anxiety,"I usually watch one movie every night. I don't normally get anxiety from movies, but it does happen. I can watch a horror movie (like with jump scares, or lots of blood etc) and be fine, then I watched this movie called Midsommar last week, which is sort of a horror movie, but not entirely. The movie kept me up all night. It just seemed to have subliminal messages and the movie just felt so off. And although I would say I enjoyed it, I had major anxiety symptoms afterwards, and basically throughout the entire movie. I watched that last week. 

Now, It's almost 2am and I just finished a movie called The Humans and now I'm getting that same feeling. I went into the movie knowing nothing about it, and now I'm starting to feel very off and trying not to go into panic. Does anyone else experience this when watching movies?"
Anxiety,Anyone else get anxiety about refills for anxiety meds?,"Whenever I refill I go on a website to send the refill request to my psychiatrist. idk it just seems like I'm just worrying about nothing. I guess its because I never get the call from my pharmacy about my prescription being ready and I get worried if its even there, then my mind starts worrying that I will withdrawl. 

I mean I did withdrawl off Lorazepam once until I got to the hospital after a very traumatic 3 days where I had the worst panic attack in my life."
Anxiety,I DID IT!!,"Finally, finally for the first time in so so so long I had a night where I didn’t think about or have anxiety once. It was like heaven. I spent the night with all my friends just talking and it was great. I’ve done the exact same thing so many times but I always worry about my anxiety the entire time, but I’ve been working so hard and it’s finally getting better

It was just a normal boring night but it was the most fun I’ve had in forever and it literally felt like heaven. I didn’t even realize until after I left that I hadn’t thought about my anxiety the entire time it was so amazing. I can’t believe everyone else feels like that the entire time

I am so so happy with myself that I am making progress and getting better and fighting. I love myself for it and I’ve come so far. I know every day won’t be like this and I will still have bad days and some stretches may be hard, but it’s so good to finally see my work paying off and it’s just so amazing

I hope others get motivated from this post that no matter how many times you hear never give up and it gets better, and no matter how stupid you think it is. It literally is true and it will happen one day for all of you"
Anxiety,Anyone get heart palpitations sometimes?,"I have anxiety/health anxiety so anything can make me anxious body wise . I get heart palpitations sometimes. I get ones that feel like your heart skips/jumps for a second in your chest. I’ve had all the heart tests done in April at cardiologist, all normal. I still worry about heart stuff sometimes. I’ve had heart palpitations almost my whole life and they’re not often or anything thankfully. This one I felt right as I turned over in bed &amp; now I’m up &amp; anxious a bit. It’s 3:26 a.m &amp; have to be up at 6. Ugh.

Anyone else get these?"
Anxiety,"Worried, would like to hear what you folks think","So on Wednesday I went to an Xmas market, which was quite busy and we spent some time indoors waiting to collect ice skates - I was wearing a mask most of the time for the indoors bit but it was very busy in the tent… since Wednesday night I’ve had 5 hours sleep and then 2 hours sleep, and I’m just really worried about getting sick because of not getting much sleep after the event - I’m terrified of covid, but I’ve had two jabs and had covid 4 months ago. What do you guys think in terms of risk of this?? Im doing everything to boost my immune system such as vitamin c, green teas etc?"
Anxiety,Trip anxiety,"I suffer from travel anxiety and I got a stagg do tomorrow in another city with 20 other people and today is the day before so it's flaired up so bad as soon as I woke up I got the classics 
Feeling sick
Don't wanna get out of bed
Needing toilet
Really bad mood
No motivation
Thinking how can I get out of it
Worrying about leaving

Anxiety,An injured arm makes me feel everyone else in the world is better than me,Is there any mental tricks I can do to accept things and not put myself down all day like I’m trash?
Anxiety,Trying to deal with anxiety and panic attacks,"Hey guys for about 2 years now I've been trying to cope with my anxiety I can't stop freaking out doesn't matter what I do or where I go, I'll even be sitting in the house with nothing going on and be freaking out, the doctor put me on antidepressants 3 months ago to try and help but there not and trying to hold it together everyday is getting harder and everytime I call in sick to work because my anxiety is that bad it makes it worse because I'm then freaking out about work.

I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm getting tired living like this."
Anxiety,books to help with anticipatory anxiety,"I have really bad anxiety about the future and about anticipating events in my far away future, im just really scared. Does anyone know any self help book about catastrophizing/anticipatory anxiety?"
Anxiety,Life with anxiety,"I have had anxiety for over a year now. At the start it was causing me awful chest pain, and I would constantly be in my head about weird feelings in my body. I started to have awful thoughts and rly wondered what was the point in going on in life. But joining this sub Reddit rly helped me a lot to know that there are ppl going through this as well. And maybe even worse than me and if they can wake up everyday trying to better themselves than so can I. I have gotten better with my anxiety I try to stay occupied or read this Reddit when I have anxiety to try and ignore it and it’s rly helped. So I just wanted to thank you guys for sharing your stories/ experiences."
Anxiety,Ruined Birthday,"My anxiety is really severe at the minute and I feel like I'm verging on a breakdown. 

I wake up and the anxiety is already there. The headaches, the chest pains, that feeling of absolute dread all over my body. Then my mind starts thinking and catastrophising, making me believe the worst and that I have ruined my life. It's constantly there and controlling my life. I can't watch TV without it being triggered and going out is really tough. I can't stop crying. I've told the people closest to me and they say things like ""you've got nothing to worry about"", ""just stop worrying"", ""will you just cheer up"", ""you're making yourself unwell"" and ""I'm fed up of this"". 

Today is my birthday and I just want to be left alone. I'm receiving so many nice cards, presents, and messages which I'm really grateful for. But I fear I'm just coming across ungrateful because my mind genuinely will not let me feel happiness. It's so upsetting because this is my favourite time of year and I love celebrating my birthday/Christmas. But it's all ruined by this stupid condition. I don't know what to do. I've got a self-help book for negative thoughts but the anxiety is too strong. I've got a doctor's appointment but it's not for another 2 weeks. I suppose I could look at restarting my antidepressants which helped massively when I was on them (weaned off of them 4 months ago). But it's likely that the symptoms will get worse and ruin my birthday even more. I just don't know what to do. 😞"

Anxiety,"Managing severe anxiety without benzos, is it possible?","I have been having panic attacks since I was 4 years old (I'm 33 now). I have a formal diagnosis of GAD, ADHD and CPTSD. It manifests a lot of health anxiety, thinking I'm dying or gravely ill. I typically have a sense of distress all the time that I can't pinpoint or get rid of. 

I've had a benzo script for years and have always been very cautious with it using them sparingly, but i had a particularly rough few medical years with a lot of trauma and particularly the last 6 months my dependence has crept up on me. I track my mood and medication data daily so I can see the trends. I've been trying to get stable on a new antidepressant but I have terrible reactions to them and nothing seems to work.

I have just had a psych ward stay for a month to try a new antidepressant, but my psychiatrist is not concerned about my benzo use at all. In fact, the two I have been seeing (inpatient and outpatient) are both encouraging me to use them more regularly and liberally? I have expressed my concerns and they keep assuring me I'm not an addict and that I can wean off later when things ""settle down"". 

I am so uncomfortable with my reliance on them, I try not to take them every day but it has gotten to the point where it's basically every second day, and usually only one, but I can feel myself counting the days between them waiting until I can ""justify"" taking one to get a break from the relentless, constant state of discomfort and anxiety I experience.

Has anyone managed to cope without them? Any advice for alternatives or other tools? I want to trust and believe my psychiatrists but I was addicted to a prescribed stimulant when I was younger and although I have been clean for 10 years it has left me skeptical and cautious."
Anxiety,Anyone else had this experience?,Currently having needle like stabbing sensations from scalp/eye/cheek/nose and upper lip on one side of my face. This has followed a trigger from a week ago but only started yesterday morning. It’s been constant since :(
Anxiety,A great podcast that is amazing for anxiety,"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iM4XnnU4WrLpC6PNgDtHN?si=dtAFTjSCTwiujBvUCpjLBg&amp;context=spotify%3Ashow%3A7iQXmUT7XGuZSzAMjoNWlX

Steve Baskett is an entrepreneur and owner of quit a famous podcast series known as “The diary of a CEO”. Many of his episodes are talking about success and how to maximise your life. But many of his podcasts are with many mental health experts and those that have released self-improvement type regimes. 
These podcasts have helped my anxiety tremendously and not only that but bolster my confidence and seek improvement and excitement in my future. 

Specifically the link above, is a great episode with Mel Robbins. I recommend everyone listen to this particular episode, and if you like it to go through some of the others he has had with many different people. It has been an incredible experience and I just wanted to to share with everyone here. 

Enjoy and keep thriving!"
Anxiety,huge anxiety about many things,"I've suffered with anxiety for many years and it's ruined much. No surprise. 

Not long ago I started buying crypto and my already high stress levels have gone even higher. I made my purchase and I will be holding my crypto coin for a long time. 

I'm not young and I live with my parents. I've invested $5k usd. I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Almost like I'm committing a crime. I am experiencing high levels of stress because I'm always thinking and worrying what my parents think. Had I not invested five grand but instead 500 dollars I think I'd still be at the same high level of anxiety. 

I don't know why I can't do this. A 16yo can but I can't. My days are awful because of this one choice. It seems that I have missed out on some developmental stage of life. 

Anytime I've mentioned crypto to my parents they've just gone silent. 

I've tried to think rationally about it but I've found that in doing so I am justifying my investment choice as if it's a bad thing. For eg, I've said to myself, people go on holidays or whatever etc, I've put that off so I can invest my money. But shortly after I'm back at stressing out about my choice and what my parents think. I really don't know wtf is wrong with me. Today it's this investment choice producing huge anxiety and next month it'll be another thing. Trading crypto is stressful for me but not for the usual reasons obviously. 

I'm thinking of pulling out of it. This stress of mine is way too much. 

Any advice is much appreciated."
Anxiety,When meditation doesn’t work.,"Friends,

my mind, at times, is so incredibly overpowering and overbearing that I feel incapable of practicing any of the strategies I’ve learned - meditation, journalling, gratitude, exercise. I can literally “feel” my mind slip away and turn into an obsessive insecure thought machine. It truly is fascinating - in retrospective - but terrible in the moment.

My fellow over thinkers - what the f$&amp;@ do you do in moments where your mind hits you with the strength of a thousand thought storms?!?! Please! Share your strategies! I am desperate and not prepared to get on medication (sexual dysfunction is NOT something I want to risk). 

Love."
Anxiety,Silent lurker first post,"First of all thank you all for your tips and positive vibes in the comments! I have been visiting this sub for months now.

I’m 19 and I have crippling anxiety it was so bad I took a year off from school because it wastoo much for me. Everyday going to school became unbearable for me.

I left school almost 2 months agi and my anxiety got a little better. I started working at my local supermarket part time. I made friends there and met my gf there too.

I used to overthink and get anxious about what university I should go to and how I would ever be comfortable studying for years and then work until I’m gray and old. I thought about this from when I woke up to when I tried to sleep at night for a long time. This caused many panic attacks for me at random times too.

When I made the decision to leave school and sort my life out I began to do simple stuff like watching what I ate, quit drinking (I got drunk every weekend and started to drink during weekdays too), I made a habit of going to the gym (blow off steam and get better posture), finally my gf helped me so much.

During the last few months she was always there. Whenever I had a panic attack she calmed me down. She studies now and I can’t see her often but I always call her when I need to and she I don’t know how she does it but takes my mind somewhere else, she holds me often when we cuddle and tells me reassuring things. I often think what did I do to deserve someone like her? You know she was just there non judgemental and calm, always wanting to help and there for me.

After I met her my life became better and I started the little changes I mentioned above.

Next to this, this sub helped me too. Made me realise that I’m not alone and it’s okay. Sometimes that’s enough for me.

I want to thank you. Keep going you strong minded people!"
Anxiety,"""Feel the fear and do it anyway""... does this actually work?","I spent years living in a very small world due to anxiety, avoiding anything and everything that made me anxious and obviously missed out on a lot of enjoyable experiences. I started therapy a couple of years ago and decided that the only way to help anxiety was to stop avoiding life and prove to my messy brain that I could do the things I wanted to and stay safe. But the world still feels like a very scary place and that doesn't seem to be going away yet. I'm pushing through and making myself do the things that scare me but I'm usually finding myself feeling quite low afterwards, as the anxiety sucks the joy out of whatever I'm doing. On the outside now I look ""normal"", I'm going to work, seeing friends, studying, spending quality time with my kids and husband, every morning I'm getting out of bed and showing up, but I don't feel much better than I did when I was allowing myself to hide away. So I'm not sure what to do at this point, other than maybe give in and start taking meds again. Advice, reassurance etc welcome."
Anxiety,Every morning,"Does anyone else wake up each and every morning and think of the things happening in the world and just ask themselves why? Why do we keep going on like this? I get it, it’s not our problem to fix but it somewhat is. No matter how hard I try to make things better and do good in life, I seem to stay in the same place and actually just feel worse. I am on meds but is that the true answer..? It’s 6:39am where I am and I do not know why I keep going on."
Anxiety,"Word swap, credit to GOT","Now, I know I cannot change the past

All I can do with the time I have left

Is to bring a little goodness into the world

Its never too late to stop over-thinking

To stop producing anxiety

And to start helping people

It's never too late to come back..."
Anxiety,I've been struggling a lot recently,"I'm not sure where to start but to keep it from being to long I returned to uni and found myself falling for an old crush again. My problem is over the last month I've found my anxiety and my depression sky rocketing, I'm almost certain I don't have a chance and she see us as nothing more than friends but my mates keep feeding that small bit of hope that I have that their is a chance and it's eating me alive. I don't want to ask her out because I'm scared of losing a friend so I'm stuck in constant cycle of pain. To make things worse I gained significant weight over the pandemic that I've struggled to lose with my constantly shifting mental health and it's causing me to become ashamed of my body, making me scared to go out in public and hang out with friends/go clubbing.

Thank you for letting me vent I just really needed a space to get things of my chest atm."
Anxiety,My teachers don’t take my anxiety seriously..what should I do?,"I don’t know what to do honestly I’ve only told about 3 teachers and they all brushed it off. One of them was like « you don’t get anxiety when you do it for me, oh and btw you have an oral presentation next Monday ». Another one said it wasn’t serious or it’s bs. 


I don’t even know what to think about it like it’s very serious for me and it gives me anxiety attacks and panic attacks."
Anxiety,Finally checking myself as a inpatient in a few weeks to get the help i need. current life is a living hell of of crying and convinced im dying ect.,"my life has turned into a living hell and have never struggled as much as i have to date.  i'v ruined all friendships and even my relationship with my girlfriend is under strain because of how i am. i am worried 24/7 about every little ache or pain or symptom i get. i have vision issues, muscles aches, dizzyness, you name it. i walk around thinking i am dying and im supposed to act like im fine. im 30 and live at home still. no job or any qualifications. but whatever, atleast im gonna get the help i need i guess. it's just the waiting to go as a inpatient that is killing me.  each day is a fucking struggle and i gotta wait another couple weeks for my insurance to kick in so i can go in private. not sure what else to say really."
Anxiety,No apetite??,"Ok so I'm constantly anxious about feeling nauseous and I get super hungry but have no apetite, ever and have to force myself to eat. Always convinced I'm gonna feel like crap from food. Long story but it's just a fear of feeling nauseous/sick. I know its probably my anxiety but it never stops and I need to be told if this is normal or not!"
Anxiety,Can taking anxiety medications help with health anxiety?,I never really wanted to try meds before because I dont wanna get addicted &amp; i know some get bad side effects but now im up for trying them and see how I feel &amp; hopefully my moods can improve as well.. what were your experiences taking medications for health anxiety?
Anxiety,What happened to me?? (Long story),"TW:near death experience /drowning/ mentions of suicidal thoughts/ED 

Side note: I am extremely open with my support system. They know exactly how I feel so no one is in the dark about this. I am safe and I am not in any danger. 

About a year and a half ago I ended up with crippling anxiety and panic disorder and now I don’t know who I am. 

Pre Covid my life was the polar opposite of how I live now. I had a big group of friends I would see often, was in school full time, and traveled on a plane or road trip almost every weekend. I was extremely self sufficient at a young age. Though I was still a minor at this time I lived on my own and supported myself (very unique situation but I had a great relationship with both parents though one had their own family and the other lived too far away for me to stay with them full time and live my life in the city where I’m from). Either way I was very independent and loved it. Couldn’t wait to be on my own and have a routine. I looked forward to graduating and working full time and was finally excited about life. I have struggled with periods of severe depression through my childhood and teens because of some past trauma growing up but regardless I felt really good for the first time. 

Around March of 2020 when the pandemic hit is when everyone’s lives really changed including my own. School was online and was awful. I didn’t go to college so I didn’t have similar class work. My “zoom classes” required me to be on camera on an iPad 8 hours a day in my own home. We wouldn’t get credit or would loose hours if they couldn’t see our faces(my school was hour based attendance). I rarely left my apartment during March-May. I spent my birthday alone for the most part because of social distancing. Started getting very depressed again, though I was seeing a therapist regularly again starting in April of 2020. Being alone and bored with little social interaction for so many months was hard. There was obviously not much to do around the city so I spent my time in class 9-5/5 days a week. 

That May I had my first real panic attack. Me and few out out-of-state friends who had all been on lockdown decided to go to my friends beach house to have a going away party for a friend who was moving out of the country and another moving to the opposite coast. Covid restrictions were lifted in our states but we obviously still used safety precautions two weeks prior and while together (no one ended up sick). Anyway my friends were going to pick me up so we could all drive together to the beach. There was about 5 of us and we had to drive an hour out of the way to grab the 6th person. When they got to my house and I loaded my stuff up I ran inside quick with an excuse because I felt like I was going to be sick. I could breath and I did end up throwing up before I texted the friend I was closest to letting them know what happened.  We told the others to go ahead and we were going to take my car instead. I just had this bad  feeling in my gut. 

While we were there it was fine until I nearly drowned. It was terrifying. I have never felt that feeling before. The one where you think you’re about to die. I’ve been suicidal before and it’s always in the back of my mind but actually experiencing a situation that you can’t control where you could die is very different. Death became real to me. All I could think about was the call my mom was going to get from the police or whoever that I had drowned. Me and my friends were okay but shaken up. Thank god for life guards, I wish I could thank whoever saved me personally. Naturally that experience haunted me and I don’t think I’ll ever swim in the ocean again. 

Back home, school went in person shortly after this in June. I was really struggling with depression again at this point but it was natural for me since I’ve dealt with it for so long. But the anxiety was new. Leaving the house was harder. Later that month a family member who was extremely close passed away. We saw it coming but it was still really hard. I took a personal leave from school that summer which ended up lasting until around Christmas because you only get 6 months before you’re expelled (I eventually had to drop out because I was missing so many days because of my anxiety). Every time I left my house it was harder and harder. I started having regular panic attacks at work and would have to leave early. I felt really alone and convinced myself that this year was finally the year that I would go through with it. I even wrote a long letter on my laptop just in case (I never had any means of attempting even if I wanted to, I don’t have the guts for it to be honest). The world seemed to be in shambles and I really felt it.

 One panic attack I had during that summer was when I was driving home across state from a family member’s house. I had to pull over many times on the interstate because I felt like I was going to be sick. This trend continued and got worse. Normally I loved driving and this was never an issue for me. I had just done a 10 hour road trip earlier in the year. So why was this becoming so hard? 

Everything I did became really hard to do. I am so scared of everything. I went from never being home because of work/school/friends/etc. to never leaving my house. I always felt very physically ill too. I could barely eat because I would just get sick. Doctors never figured out why. It felt like I had food poisoning 24/7. I was a healthy person too. I eat very healthy food because I’m not a fan of junk food and I drink a lot of water. I think it has something to do with my anxiety but still not sure. 

Fast forward to the present, about a year later. I almost never leave my house. The only time I do is when my parents take me to doctors appointments or maybe grocery shopping though now you can order online so I don’t have to if I don’t feel like it. I always try to go In person to get my self out of the house but it takes me all day to psych my self up to finally go. I lie awake all night in bed until morning when I finally pass out from exhaustion around 9 am and sleep for a few hours. I usually nap at some point in the evening because I get headaches or just need a break from this feeling. Depression is one thing but severe forms of both at the same time is a nightmare.

 My world is so small now. I can’t even drive 30 mins to my parents house without having a panic attack. I’m seeing a therapist and hopefully getting new medication soon to see if that can help but I’ve been on everything for depression, you name it I’ve taken it at some point. It never worked well for me or the side effects would make it worse. But man some insight or literally any suggestions would help at this point. I’m stumped. I’m sick of spending all day crying and not being able to sleep at night. I haven’t slept 8 hours in god knows how long. My hair is falling out and I look like shit and feel like shit all the time. I don’t do any of my hobbies anymore nor care to do so because I have no motivation. I just want to be done with this. I worry I don’t have the mental strength anymore to fight this if I wanted to. Not giving up, just very tired of “living” like this. Why is life so overwhelming now?"
Anxiety,My butt is pretty big and some guys/girls have been making some jokes and laughing at my expense and now I feel insecure about my body. What should I do?,"Hey,     recently just discovered Reddit and finally made a post here. So why    am  I making this post, a little bit of backstory, I'm a 18 year old    woman  and am starting an internship to be a flight attendant, in the     beginnning there's a lot of school stuff you gotta do first and it's     been going great and I am loving it, the only problem is that some of  my    class mates guys tell me my ass is huge and that they think it  looks    stupid and they see know way I'd fit in the uniform, they say a  lot of    stuff like this and laugh afterwards.

On     the other hand the girls apparently have been calling me slutty    because  of my ass and the way I dress (I mostly wear tight clothes and    pants)  and sometimes even called me a slut to my face. I'll admit I   got  a  pretty big butt (especially compared to the other girls here, my    parents  aren't from Switzerland and all the other girls are very   skinny  and I  am a bit more curves)

now    what  should I do? I am loving the context and everything but the    classmates  are making it a bit hard to enjoy it to the fullest.

because of this I've been scared to go to school in my normal clothes and have even started to get some panic attacks while they were laughing at me"
Anxiety,Sleeping too long?,"Hey guys,  


anyone else got the problem that they could sleep for like 12 hours and still feel exhausted like you havent slept at all?   
For me its like no matter how many hours of sleep I get, its very dificult to get out of bed and I feel really tired all day."
Anxiety,Dealing with anxiety," Hey everyone,  I could use some outside perspective. Looking back at my life (i'm 24 years old), I didn't have the best of times growing up. I grew up really poor and it was really hard for me to create meaningful relationships with other people due to being a bit socially awkward and having anxiety (only found out I suffer from it recently). I got introduced into video games quite early in life and they soon became an escape from reality and allowed me to take part in a place where everyone was handed the same deck of cards. As a result I got really addicted to it until I recently was able to beat this addiction. I am highly competitive and if I put my mind into something I won't stop until I get there, it started in video games and it soon carried on into my real life. 3 years ago I decided I would change my life and that nothing would stand in my way of reaching my goal of becoming an enterpreneur and live freely. I have sacrificed countless nights of sleep, relationships with friends, with family and with lovers to reach this goal. At one point I was working 16+ hours a day and despite feeling like my body and my mind were crumbling appart, but I thought that once I reached my goal it would all be worth it... Fast forward to today, it has been 3 months since I started my business and I can say it started off better than I could have ever imagined, I work whenever I want, money is no longer a problem for me (i'm not rich by any standart but comparing to how I was 3 years ago it's a completely different reality), but I still feel like I am missing something... During the day I often find myself comparing my position the the position I was at 3 years ago and it gives me motivation and strength to attack the day and make shit happen, but when I go to bed at night I can't sleep... I get really restless and anxious for no apparent reason... I am by far in the best position I have ever been in every way imaginable, but I still feel like I am missing something. Before, whenever I felt anxious, afraid, tired, lonely, etc... the sole thought of reaching my goal gave me  a surge of energy and hope, something to strive towards. But now, despite feeling like I can improve myself way more and reach new heights, I find myself randomly crying at night and not knowing why... I sacrificed everything in order to reach my goal, am I paying the price for it now ? Was I hiding my internal issues and blaming it all on money and not being where I want to be in life ? Thanks in advance guys, I will soon be talking to a professional in the area as well.**Mostrar menosRESPONDER**

Anxiety,Scared to take my meds,I was recently put on 5mg lexapro two days ago and have a follow up with the psychiatrist in a week. I’m so scared to take it. I’m scared of serotonin syndrome and all the other side effects. Any advice?
Anxiety,Your headache might be caused by a lack of fresh air while you are sleeping,"There is a TLDR below. This isn't medical advice.

My wife and I moved to a new flat around a month ago. I'm a programmer (Male, 31) and since moving I have had a very minor headache and lack of concentration that I confused with diabetes. (I have a low-blood sugar problem that sometimes goes too low unexpectedly and gives me headaches. I thought it got worse but I was mistaken.) 

If I woke up with this mild headache, it doesn't heal until the evening and I couldn't concentrate and also don't want to work because of it, wasting a full day.

I was getting really annoyed I couldn't do my job well for around a month, and I'm really relieved to finally find the reason behind it. I went to a diabetes doctor, my mother(who is a doctor) researched a lot by discussing my symptoms with other doctors, and she was thinking it was either Surmenage, a weird kind of diabetes or etc. 

It was a lot more simple than that.

I measured the CO2 buildup in our bedroom with a CO2 measuring device, the new flat leaks so little fresh air from its windows, even though the air in our bedroom is completely fresh when we sleep, it wasn't enough for 8 hours of sleep as it doesn't move between the rooms and we both were getting bad sleep because of it. 

We have 2 flats right now we usually use the 2nd flat only for sleeping and taking a bath and etc. After waking up we leave the windows of our bedroom open for around 30 minutes and then we just go down to our other flat(which is 1 floor downstairs) for working and spending time, so the air inside bedroom and corridor should keep fresh.

But I measured the CO2 buildup in our bedroom with a CO2 measuring device, and I was wrong that the air in this bigger room and corridor would be enough for a couple having a full night's sleep. 

My measurement was like this:

When we sleep: CO2 is 650 ppm which is almost as low as it gets if we spent some time in the room.

After around 3 hours of sleep it was around 1000 ppm.

When we woke up it was 1600 ppm.

I have been measuring CO2 in our office for many years as I experienced when it's higher than 1000 I lose a bit of concentration, and when it's higher than 1300 I start to get anxiety, I don't feel comfortable and if I keep working like that I start having a mild headache.

In our old flat, because it was top floor it had those angled windows in the corridor and kitchen which open upside to the roof and those windows were leaking some air even when they were closed. The new flat doesn't have those windows and also misses windows on the corridor. After moving we were closing the other rooms windows in bedrooms flat to save on heating. But this meant air could only move between the corridor and the bedroom. 

As the new bedroom is a lot bigger (22m-sqr. with 3m height, probably 2 times more volume compared to older roof room), I thought air would already be more than enough for a nights sleep for a couple, turns out I'm wrong and air has to leak to move through rooms or CO2 gets too high in the bedroom causing bad sleep.

We both also saw fewer dreams and we were waking up more often when it's close to mornings which also confirms that.

To solve this issue, I will just make some air leak through the window by trapping some cardboard between it so it can't close airtight. And I hope it will get a lot better.

If any of you have similar issues like having headaches some mornings, I really suggest getting one of those CO2 measuring devices, without it, I wouldn't even understand what's wrong and we would keep living like this trying to find my mysterious health issue. 

I believe many people have this issue but just aren't aware of it. At least in my homeland windows somehow leak because they aren't as good, but in Germany some windows are very well built and are airtight, and that's actually bad for health. If a couple lives in a room CO2 gets up in just a few hours because no air leaks inside, and opening windows before sleeping isn't enough for around 8 hours for sleep in our case, it still has to leak inside a bit or move between windows at other sides of the flat.

I hope this post finds some people who have headaches in the morning just like I had. 

TLDR: I had a mysterious headache that starts every morning and doesn't disappear until the evening. Turns out it was because of insufficient fresh air when sleeping. A couple consumes a lot more fresh air than I expected and air-tight windows cause CO2 level in the room to increase too much as windows don't leak any fresh air. I recommend getting a CO2 measurement device to measure it if you have similar symptoms. Or somehow try to make your window leak a little bit while you are sleeping to see if it cures your morning headache."
Anxiety,Extreme public eating anxiety,"Long story short: I’ve developed an extreme fear of not eating enough when I’m out &amp; about, and worry I may pass out from lack of food even when I’ve eaten loads.

This may be turning into a borderline eating disorder as it’s badly interfering with my life and I’m starting to cancel on going places/ meeting up with people etc just to avoid my eating problems. I even resorted to hiding in a toilet &amp; scoffing food afew weeks back : (

Does any else suffer with this? Any advice/ potential fixes. Even ideas for foods which are easily portable &amp; equivalent to a meal, any advice would be appreciated"
Anxiety,How do you deal with anxiety related insomnia?,"Just literally looking for tips. Since I started working recently, I’ve really struggled with feeling relaxed enough to actually fall asleep. Like, I literally feel like I’m fighting with myself to keep my eyes closed to try and sleep.

And I’m going to hit a point where I’m just not functional, because I’m not getting any sleep regularly.

Anyone have any tips?"

Anxiety,I have an executive dysfunction disorder due to my diagnosed anxiety and I basically don’t do anything.,I took meds and everything so I stopped having anxiety attacks but I have no idea what to do with my lack of any will to do anything. I even have problems to make myself a cup of tea. Now that autumn/winter started it’s even worse I spend all my days in bed.
Anxiety,Do you exercise?,"I'm just genuinely wondering how many people on here who have anxiety, regularly and consistently  exercise. For me exercising regularly was the game changer in treating my anxiety.

I'm not trying to push an agenda I just want to know how many do and how many don't. If you've got a bit more time to reply I'd love to know why you do or don't."
Anxiety,That Damn burning/pins and needles!!!,"Hello y'all 
24 yo male here, I have been experiencing non stop burning sensation or pins and needles feeling in my both legs and feets, it gets way worse when I'm lifting weights and when I'm wearing socks and shoes. 
It's so weird and odd, I feel so frustrated and lonely, not a single doctor or a specialist have a single explanation ,did blood tests, MRI, nerve screening etc....  Nothing is found. 
So sad and desperate about it and no one I know ever experienced that. 
Did anyone had this issues before?  Especially the burning feet when lifting weights?  All the answers and support is appreciated :)"
Anxiety,How to handle a terrible therapist?,"So today I was in for a first appointment with a therapist and all I can say is that I’m definitively not going to see him ever again. 
First off his room was super dirty and weird. There were croissant crumbs all over the floor, then it was super untidy and uncomfortable. It rather looked like an alternative guy’s college room rather than a therapist’s office. This did not make me feel comfortable at all, 
Then the therapist himself was kinda strange. There were a lot of awkward pauses throughout the conversation and I left with the feeling that my anxiety and depression were my fault because I didn’t seek help earlier. Also I told him about destructive relationships that caused my condition but he didn’t really take care of it. He didn’t make me feel like he understood what I was talking about. Much rather he made me feel like my problems are dumb and not worth his time. 
After all I just feel way more horrible than I felt before and don’t know how to cope with that.

Have you had experiences like that? How did you handle them?

Thanks for listening &lt;3"
Anxiety,DAE get anxiety dreams?,"Woke up just now from a very strong anxiety dream. In it I was having an attack and now I feel anxious in real life.

Hope everyone is doing okay today."

Anxiety,I need a success story!,"I have generalized anxiety disorder which really sucks, because there are no real triggers and no situation i can just confront. I simply feel bad all the time. Dizzy, foggy, nauseated, chestpains etc. 
What gives me the most anxiety is the thought that I will never be able to feel relaxed again and enjoy life. 

So is there anyone who has overcome their anxiety?"
Anxiety,I'm always anxious about things not going according to plan to the point where I can't stop thinking about it for days.,"Tomorrow night my friend and I are going to grab a few drinks at a place. This place is owned by I guy I had a thing for and I honestly have been wanting to see him again for a while. 

I always have to draw a plan, at 5 o clock she has to come over, then we have to do this, then grab dinner and go get wasted. My problem is I always have high expectations and you cannot simply tell me to ""not have expectations"" because it just doesn't work like that. I am so anxious that the night won't go as planned or that she won't manage to come over last minute that I spend days and days overthinking it. 

We spoke about it on Tuesday and I had to text her earlier this afternoon to ask her whether she still wants to go because I can't function without knowing it. I'm always thinking something is gonna happen and ruin the plans.

Also I haven't had fun and gone out with someone in ages so I'm highly relying on it.. it's been a stressful period and I just need it but all the time I wanna do something fun and have a great time, things never go as planned and I get disappointed.

What can I do not to stress over it?"
Anxiety,Alcohol &amp; anxiety,"Every time I Google it I get that it makes it worse I understand the Hanover part after and how it's bad....

Anxiety,PSA: discrimination from professors &amp; how to protect yourself,"I live with mental illness and I work in academia so I've experienced this kind of BS first hand both as a student and as an employee.

To be clear: you are not the asshole. I absolutely empathize with overworked professors (truuuuuust me), but it is inexcusable to take the legitimate exhaustion out on us. It is discrimination, full-on.

If you're in a place where you have the option, talk to your school's disability office. There are accommodations available for what we live with. I'll share some links below.

Anxiety,Naming your Anxiety,"Hi all - burner account as I'd like to keep my real account separate.

I've read a lot about ""naming"" your anxiety. My therapist suggested this as well, and I have considered trying it, but it sort of freaks me out a little bit. Naturally, I worry about schizophrenia, although I'm early 40s and have never had issues with that, just anxiety and depression. 

If I do name my anxiety, I considered naming him ""Bobby"" which is apparently my imaginary friend from childhood, although I don't remember Bobby at all. I grew out of imaginary friends around age 6 or so.

So the question is, does anyone do this? Does it bother you? Should I worry about ""Bobby"" or is it ok to ""name"" your anxiety, in the sense you 'remove' it from your true self as a way of dealing with it, sort of like you'd deal with a worrying child or something? Thank you."
Anxiety,Calling anxiety with discord Voice Chat,"Since a month I am part of a discord community which I am feeling really at home in. I like the people and I am making friends. There is just one problem: I have major anxiety of the voice chat.

The voice chat is quite a big part of the server and people ask me to join all the time. I want to but I am too scared for some stupid reason. I have had calling anxiety my whole life so it's not that weird but it's just so stupid.

I have hovered with my mouse cursor above the voice chat multiple times to join, but everything I try to bring myself to join I get anxiety and fail to do it. It's just one stupid click! Why can't I do it? Why am I so scared? These people are my friends... they wouldn't think I am weird for joining. Why can't I do it!.

It really makes me angry at myself, but even so. I am still really frightend of calling with people and well...voice chat is just basically a call."

Anxiety,i (F22) very recently discovered the adrenaline rushing through my chest is anxiety,"i’ve felt this so many times with no understanding of it before. I want to say it’s been happening for as long as i can remember, i have no memory of the first time i felt it. I used to feel it everyday before work.

Anyway I’ve been feeling it constantly for several days. I had a friend breakup with a person who i thought i had a crush on and he’s been literally ignoring my existence and being so rude to me. idk what to do or how to feel better. 

I thought maybe i could track my anxiety by viewing my heart rate from my smart watch and I noticed I’m somewhere around 115bpm every-time i feel that rush of energy.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I would like encouraging words and maybe tips? If I try a breathing exercise it only calms me down a little and then I get worked up again. It feels like I’m dying and I want it to stop"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious from the though of doing work and then just put it off to feel better?,"I have a final due in 2 hours ,but I am too anxious to finish it. It has gotten to the point where it should be 10+ hour work is going to have to be done in 2 hours and poorly done. I do this with everything. I just get anxious about thinking of doing something and I avoid doing until I absolutely have to."
Anxiety,Everyday feels like I’m just pushing myself.,The title says it all. Everyday I’m just pushing myself to make it. It doesn’t stop there are no breaks. And today I am super nauseous. I don’t know if it’s from the anxiety but it’s definitely not helping my mental state. And once again I just gotta push myself through the day and tomorrow too. Feels like I’m doomed to get sick or burn out eventually and that terrifies me. I don’t know how long I can keep this up. Luckily it’s the holidays soon and I plan on doing nothing and making it a goal to not get anxious about wasted time. Please share some encouragement i could really use it. If your read this thank you so much. I hope you are all having a great day.
Anxiety,First Day At Work,"I’m very scared and trembling, I feel sick and heated up. Anyone else get like that? I was confident yesterday but now I don’t know.

Breathing techniques trigger me to focus on breathing, so I feel like nothing works. I’m doomed."
Anxiety,"HELP!!! Anxiety symptoms, is it anxiety/panic thought?","Hello, new here first post… 


Let’s start off with I’m a British 23yo male, 3 years ago on bonfire night my whole life changed, I had what doctors said was a Panic attack. I was fixing my car on bonfire night and was like sitting on the ground just fixing my car a little bit stressed and I stood up and my heart felt like it was gonna come out my chest for around 10minutes my heart was pounding so hard and so fast. I panicked and started racing around the house etc it eventually calmed down but then i obsessed about my heart and the weird thing my whole world changed from that night, I’m more nervous etc. Tho this isn’t the only symptom, i felt dizzy around a month after this, for around 6months and was referred to a neurologist and he said I’m fine as I was worrying about a tumour, but everyday since then I’ve delt with symptoms I’ll list below 

Shortness of breath 
Dizzyness
Palpitations
Always aware of my heart beating
Weird eye vision 
Feel like I’m fake like life is fake and not real 
Kinda dreamy feeling
Sore chest 
Numb arm 
Numb finger tips 


But recently I have had new symptoms show up which are scaring me. 

Shakiness, tight tense muscles, jelly legs. 
I’m so scared as I’ve never experienced this ☹️ 

I’ve been for help I’ve been in multiple a/e rooms, ecgs, multiple blood tests, CBT, therapy. 

Also at nighttime I feel like I can’t see right? Like it’s just weird vision, nothing has changed and I mean nothing, everyday is like a fight for life, I wake up and go to sleep with the thought that this is it I’m dying, I had such a symptom free life before that bonfire night, I enjoyed life. Everything I love doing I just can’t do it no more because my anxiety. 

I read a couple forums on here and thought I’d post and try engage with people who have similar experiences, can I feel like this 24/7? 

Does anybody have the symptoms I’ve listed. 

Thank you 🙏🏻"
Anxiety,Does anyone else feel this way?,"I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for a good bit now and nothing seems to help.

Anxiety,Been on Edge for over a week.,"Hey guys its me again,

Since last tuesday after i had a panic attack ive been on edge with a higher heart rate and far greater anxiety constantly feeling like ill get another panic attack. Ive started to calm myself down when it feels like im gonn have one, but my question is whether this will go on for a while?

The doctors have put me on anti depressants and checked my heart telling me things will be fine but obviously my anxiety says differently. I constantly feel minor chest pain in different areas along with a constant sense of impending doom.

Has anyone had attacks with after effects like this? If so how long did yours last?"
Anxiety,Has anyone tried gabapentin?,I take gabapentin (neurontin) for nerve pain and I feel like it puts me in a better mood. Google says it can be prescribed off label for anxiety. Anybody else take this?

Like besides my usual racing heart, shakey cold hands, scattered thoughts, I've noticed this start to become an extra uncontrollable symptom whenever i panic.. Getting worse n worse and can't calm it down unless I cancel all plans to go out even if it's a 5 minute drive or important appointments. .."

Anxiety,Any success stories out there?,"I have had anxiety for about 11 years. I’m 46 and also in peri menopause. It seems to be off and on, but when it’s on, it’s so debilitating. I can’t work with any function and my sleep is spotty, at best. I take Pristiq, but I still feel the usual annoying and devastating symptoms. I walk briskly every day and try to eat well. I also do my best with mindfulness techniques daily. Does anyone out there have a similar story that will perhaps put me at ease? Thank you!"
Anxiety,Panic attack over nothing,"This morning I woke up to realize I forgot to take the trash out the night before, so it’s 8:30am and I push the trash can out near my road normally the garage truck will show up around 11 but I still was not sure if he had already passed, well some time goes by and it starts eating at me not knowing if I had missed the pick up and it’s all I could think about, I felt so depressed over garbage, anyway I was just seeing if anyone else had weird times when something that really doesn’t matter ends up bringing them to the edge of having a panic attack over something dumb"
Anxiety,My job's making me sick but I don't know what else to do,"Basically I have to work night shifts in this job and I can't get out of it, if I do get out of it I'll be judged by literally everyone on the team and will feel like shit anyway. The job is so fast paced (healthcare) and stressful every single day - it's making my anxiety worse and I feel like my body is telling me that I need to stop because I can't handle the pressure on top of my general life anxieties and health anxiety. 

The night shifts make any progress I make with my therapy vanish and we have to start at square one, and my social life is crap now. 

I'm so upset because I love my job, I did a degree to get this job, im due a mega promotion next year which would see my financial problems go away. I don't know what other job I could see myself doing, the uncertainty on whether I stick with this job, try to quit night shifts, or go a completely new direction is fuelling my anxiety further and I just feel like my body is shutting down on me."
Anxiety,So does anyone else overthink the unhealthy things that could happen when you eat food,"This may sound weird but like when the holidy's come like thanksgiving I'll be eating pie or something and be like ""this amount of food is really unhealthy"" even though it only happens once a year. Now I live with a lot of peaple this causes a lot of things to happen. For instance we had pizza on wensday, now I like pizza but thanksgiving was like 2 weeks ago. Anyone else have thoughts like this?"
Anxiety,Online doctors?,"Does anybody receive treatment all online? I need to switch doctors because my old one was out of state (we used telehealth)  :( I live in a very rural area, basically all the doctors near by are full for months. I can’t afford to drive almost 5 hours to the nearest city every time I need to talk to my doctor. I’m being prescribed Wellbutrin, hydroxyzine, and the occasional benzo for extreme anxiety. Is it possible to see a doc online and continue having these prescribed? or are there any weird rules? (esp w benzos), if so what site/doctor(s) do you use?"
Anxiety,"I feel isolated because of my anxiety, and I find it really hard to be vulnerable. Any tips?","I started going to therapy around 3 months ago, which is where I first found out about my anxiety. Ever since then I realized how much it genuinely effects my life and how I experience certain things. I feel so alone in the way i think and process events. I’m constantly afraid that everyone around me thinks i’m too sensitive and that i’m incredibly dramatic. I try my hardest not to let my anxious thoughts get in the way of my relationships with people, but it always seems to find it’s way into them. In fact, recently someone that I had been talking to for about 4 months just broke things off with me, and I have a feeling it has something to do with me being a high maintenance person.


I feel like every time I’m open and honest with someone, specifically a partner, about my anxiety it scares them away. In all honesty I don’t feel like I ask for much, I only ever usually ask for more reassurance every now and then and I’m always really patient with people when it comes to the actual action. A lot of the time I also feel so different from everyone around me, I find that a lot of the time people don’t care much to attempt in understanding why I act the way i do. And of course this isn’t their job in the slightest but the effort would mean a lot to me. 

I’m still very new to all of this and i’m still figuring myself out, but I hate that i drive people away so often 

tldr: i feel like i drive people away from me due to my anxious thoughts and this leads to  feelings of isolation. i would appreciate any tips on how to feel less alone"
Anxiety,I am tired,"Sitting here. Feeling that my blood pressure is high. Worrying over it without possibility to check. Thinking if it high. Am I dying. Will I need medication. Forever? Have some palpitations. During last weeks I’ve been in doctor about palpitations. Nothing in EKG. Been in doctor about heartburn. They said it’s stress reflux/Gerd. I was and am sure it’s cancer. Found a lump from my diaphragm. Back to doctor. Normal. 


Now at cottage trying to take it easy but no. Next worry as said, blood pressure. Last weeks had a lot of stress from work. Had Covid. Moved house. Etc. so I am mentally drained. Exhausted. Angry to myself. Why can’t I let go. Why do I do this to myself. I will get punished. 

I’m sorry. Just venting. I’m tired. Needed to say that. I’m just miserable."
Anxiety,Moving Anxiety,"Hi all, long time girl dealing with anxiety here. Long story short I have moved into a new apartment and am struggling with getting over the anxiety I am feeling. 

It’s a constant thing that is getting in the way of my eating and other daily functioning including school, and I just really need help. 

The apartment is a basement suite and I’m just wondering if anyone else had any issues with anxiety when they moved and if there was advice for adjusting. 

I feel very lost right now. I keep trying to distract myself but the feelings are still there. I do have a call with my family doctor and my therapist a bit after that but I am feeling so weighed down by this. 

Any advice would honestly be appreciated."

Anxiety,Does listening to Disney music calm anyone else's anxiety?,I am dealing with some severe anxiety right now. Mediation isn't worker and this problem is in my thoughts allll day. Searching for calming music I came across some Disney music and being a long time Disney fan as a kid I played some and my anxiety suddenly is gone. The sick feeling in the pit of my stomach - gone. I feel positive for once and I'm not worrying.
Anxiety,What do you do when therapy isn't an option?,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, I am now 35. It has ebbed and flowed through the years, sometimes I've taken medication, sometimes I have had counsellors. Some of the medication and therapy has helped, some have not. Currently I am not in a position to be able to afford counselling, and I have not had a family doctor in years due to the frequency in which I re-locate (probably partially due to anxiety and depression! haha).  


Anyway, I am slowly feeling myself slip back into things, every day is hard! I constantly have headaches from over thinking, I often have upset stomach. Out of no where I'll catch my self thinking ""I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself"" and even though I know I need to stop these negative thought trains it's really hard to make it stop! It's like it keeps going to spite me. I don't feel like I have any friends or any one I can trust other than my partner (super unhealthy!), I've been trying to get more socially involved as I know isolation only makes this things harder! But social interactions are hard to come by and few and far between thanks to moving to a new city with covid still being an issue.. But anytime a chance to get out and talk to people does happen I get SO anxious leading up to it, watching the clock tick down the time, dreading going, feel terrible, wanting to cancel etc. I still force myself, and end up having a good time, but I wish I didn't have to feel the dread to begin with! I have no motivation for most things in the world, although most days I can still convince myself to practice my instrument.   


I feel disillusioned with the world and the people in at. I feel like I can not relate to others, and don't understand 'the new way of things'. I go between thinking everyone is a bad person, not to be trusted, out to get me etc to thinking we're all just broken people doing the best we can. I feel like there is nothing I am good at, I'm worthless, stupid, angry, confused but it doesn't really matter because we all suck so why should I be any different. It's hard for me to find the joy, see the beauty, enjoy life and just be happy.  


I know I am better than I have been in the past, better than lots of people currently are. But I just want to not have to feel like this! I need help to be healthy again, but as I am not in a place financially  to get the help I need what do I do? I don't know why I can't just figure it out myself because I've been here before! I know to put myself in situations that make me uncomfortable, I know to stop negative thought patterns, I know to do self care, journal etc. I know these things! But either I am not doing them properly, or they just aren't working."

Anxiety,Roommate problems,"I need help because I feel like I’m actually spiralling. I live in an apartment with 2 other girls , one is my best friend for about a year and lived together that long we socialize together etc. We are living abroad from home also. The other girl we’ve lived with 6 months and found online to fill the room and she is not on the lease. The other girl has been drama and trouble since day 1 but never outwardly involving us until one night she decided to make up lies about me tell my other roommate and other friends which are disproven straight away. A verbal fight happened and then since then it’s been horrendous. I’m too anxious to leave my room to shower or cook or do laundry. I dread coming home from work and sit outside in my car for a long time. My friend doesn’t get it and just tells me I’m in the right and to go out to public spaces but I can’t even describe the anxiety that brings me. Even though I am right and have proven lies were said about me I have also brought peace offerings to house and still no apology or anything said. My friend will tell me she’s on my side but is sitting on the fence. I don’t know what to do I am mentally drained and everyone thinks I am crazy for reacting this way but I cannot control if these are the anxious feelings I am getting. Could I tell her move out - she is not on lease and I am main tenant or should I move back to my home country?"

Anxiety,Taking .25 Xanax for my panic attacks,"Hello everyone,

I have struggled with severe anxiety for about a decade. I got off SSRIs about 2 years ago and my anxiety was well managed for a while until the past 7 months. My panic attacks in general has been the most concerning. I have gotten to a point where i’ll be so anxious I will have to leave the public space I am in from sensory overload (genuinely feels like I am about to have a seizure). I was prescribed .25 Xanax yesterday for these panic attacks and wanted to hear about anyone who has/had this prescriptions experience. When I say this, I would like to know how it helped with your anxiety, not about how it becomes addictive etc. I am very well aware of the consequences xanax has and was resistant to be prescribed this for a few months. At this point, it feels like my only option. I am not taking this everyday, it’s for the severe panic attacks that take me a day to recover from. Love to all of us who fight this b*tch of a mental illness."

Anxiety,Anxiety over starting to take ssri (citalopram),"I'm a 24y.o female and I've recetly been prescribed citalopram for my anxiety and depression (never been on any medication for it before). 
I started taking it (im on day 3), 10 grams for now and change it to 20 on day 5.
I know that it takes time for it to start helping so im still having anxiety especially over taking or stopping to take citalopram. 
Has anyone else experienced this and can give me advice?
I'd also love it if you can tell me your experience on citalopram because some people say it's good for depression but not anxiety and my anxiety has been terrible for my intire life so i wanna know if i should even be taking this medication."
Anxiety,Questions about BuSpar,"Hello,

I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but it was always not that bad until I lost my dad 3 years ago, and the anxiety got way worse (overthinking, irrational fears, chest pains...)

Last year, I started taking Dogmatil, and it worked well most of the time, however, it completely messed up my period to the point where I almost have no period at all.

So, a couple of days ago, I switched to BuSpar (10mg a day), I've been taking it for 3 days and I got a lot of side effects: dizziness, nausea, headaches, tension in legs, diarrhea, and last night, I had trouble sleeping and I woke up with my heart racing.

Should I keep taking BuSpar since I read the side effects mostly go away? Or are those side effects too severe that I have to stop it?

Also, can I take Melatonin (3mg) at night to help with the sleep problem?

Thank you!"
Anxiety,1st/2nd grade embarrassment that started my self-consciousness and probably a million other things I’ve struggled with ever since,"I have a very clear memory of being in first or second grade, sitting on the floor peacefully during quiet reading time. 
I was allowing myself to be completely comfortable, I sat on one leg, and I had my face resting on the knee of my other leg. 
I had my book down in my hands and I was focused on that and nothing else....
Until a random classmate I didn’t know well started laughing and called my name to get my attention.. they proceeded to tell me that I look funny like that-my face looks funny.
I remember feeling a sudden sickening punch in my stomach the best way to describe would be that it felt like I was starving while I also had been punched in the stomach.. 
I felt my body readjust the position I was sitting in so that I wouldn’t embarrass myself again.
During the rest of the quiet reading time, i remember being so uncomfortable and super overwhelmed by the feeling that everyone had their eyes on me-and that they all might also have hurtful things to say about me that I had no idea how to handle at the time..I mean cmon I was like age 7 or 8 :( 

I’m 18 now, I just finished working at my first job (I was a sales associate + got trained to do the register) i was TERRIFIED and so extremely anxious...but wow for the first time in my life I actually feel really fucking proud of myself. 
Im still anxious as helllll but I’ve learned to actually value the care and love that I can and should give to myself. It never felt like it was enough before, but now I really try to allow myself to feel comforted by the things I do to take care of myself, instead of feeling like it is all just pointless.

There was a point and there still occasionally are times where I think I am too broken and lazy and stupid to be capable of doing anything that a normal human can do. It feels impossible, confusing, frustrating, unsafe, exhausting, depressing, and so much more, when I think about if I can be capable of taking care of myself, or living a happy satisfying life.
(It’s so hard not to go off on tangents I have adhd :P sorry)
Anyway I’ve never really posted on Reddit before but this feels good to put into words -there’s also so many more things I’d like to say(and might add later) but my phone is dying and I’d rather type on my computer lmaooo"

Anxiety,Can’t relax or do anything I would normally enjoy,"I’m quite stuck right now :/ For the past few days, I’ve been trying to find a use for the many notebooks I have, yet my mind is holding me back.

I used to really like creative writing, and I think it would be nice to go back to it to connect with the more creative part of myself, but every time I think of doing it, I overthink really bad. I go over the pros and cons in my head of what to write it in to make it last (pencil or pen), whether I should just type it (which would defeat the purpose of writing in a notebook) and whether I should even bother writing at all. I know that I’m stressing myself out over this but I hold such a high standard for what I do.

My anxiety over this has gotten so bad that my stomach is in knots and I feel sick. All I want is to be able to have something to do that lets me be creative, lets me relax, and doesn’t involve a screen in front of my face :/

Does anyone have any advice?

(In summary, I’ve been stressing myself out over finding a creative thing to do, so much that I have made my anxiety worse, and I need advice.)"
Anxiety,Addicted to xanax,"As the title implies, I am addicted to Xanax. Receiving my new subscription is like Christmas for me. I don't even take the amount prescribed. Instead I take most of the prescription each time so the meds last a few days and I feel miserable for the rest of the month.
My psychiatrist told me last time that she might eventually change my anti depressants. Do some of them help with anxiety as well?

I've went to a theme park with my girlfriend for holidays and the last day had an anxiety attack crying in the hotel room, just because im terrified...

Anxiety,Bad food anxiety,"Tw: Food, throwing up.

Was wondering if anybody else has something similar and what has helped you with it? I took SRRIs which fixed it for a while but now I'm off them it's coming back.   
\-I can't eat anything past expiration date even if it looks fine.   
\-I went to a restaurant with a colleague and I couldn't take more than 3 bites of the food because I felt like I was going to throw up. Was not fun  
\-I will throw anything that has a bit of mold away (including the plate/container) and can't enter the kitchen for a while afterwards.   
\-I can't eat homecooked rice. Only pre packaged because it's safer. Or chicken that is not freshly cooked. Or anything else that's highly perishable and over a day sitting in the fridge.   
\-any food that my brain deems ""not safe"" will trigger massive anxiety for me, can't eat  


I used to be able to eat semi normally, I just want that back. A big tigger I think was when I had food poisoning after eating some chicken and rice that was reheated. I don't even want to think about it... What can I do? Not asking for diagnosis or anything, I've been to the doctor many times and they all tell me it's anxiety related, but I never got any meaningful help from them other than take meds, meditate and stress less.   
Much appreciated!"

I got some coping mechanisms and it’s definitely better than it was. I’ve had general anxiety my whole life but this was different. Different side effects and way worse. I felt like I was dying. Xanax was the only thing to help me get through it. I started taking buspar and magnesium and it might help a little. I got one months worth of Xanax and I’m worried about being able to get more but I feel like I need it. I want to feel normal again. I’m doing completely online and I don’t have a job right now for the first time in my life as well. This gives me so much freedom to be anxious in peace but might contribute to the anxiety. I did community college for two years and I had In person classes and I seemed to enjoy it at the time. Now I’m being forced to take an in person next semester and I can’t get my mind off of it. I used to be great at school but my motivation is completely gone.  I don’t want to go to class in person. I don’t know why. In the future I will have even more classes. Sometimes I can take hydroxyzine but it makes me more tired than Xanax and doesn’t work as well. (I take the lowest dose and only when I need it a lot.) I always feel sick these days. I try to use ice when I’m anxious and be grateful for the good times but I just want to be at home with my mom. I’m like 3 hours away. My mom doesn’t have the best health and I’m young and she’s in her 60s and I just want to spend all the time I can with her. My roommates are my best friends from highschool but they’ve all changed and I don’t have much in common anymore with them. It feels off. I hate it here. I don’t feel at home. I want to move in with my boyfriend and be alone with him. It’s so expensive though to not live with less than three people and he has 4 years of college and I’m graduating in 2 years. The government helps pay for me to live here. So I’m not sure how to afford it when I graduate. It just feels like a bad time in my life and I don’t know what I’m doing and I hate it so much. And my anxiety has been killing me. I just want it to stop. I’m just ranting. Sorry for the long post and jumbled wording.
Anxiety,I just want to be normal,"I’m just tired of being tired, waking up every day with anxiety, being afraid to sleep because that silence makes my mind race. Honestly, I just want a break if my situation can’t change. One day would be enough. I’ve lost myself and I cry so often for her because I don’t recognize myself in the slightest. I just want everything to be okay but I don’t know what to do"
Anxiety,Is there anyone else who is always paranoid with the fear of death after facing a panic attack?,"It's been three months since I had the first panic attack of my life. To make it worse, it happened on my birthday. 
I'm still scared as hell but the good thing is I've been far far better than the initial days that followed the aftermath of a panic attack. Whenever I hear the news regarding the death of someone, it makes me scared as if something terrible might happen to me too.
I don't know how I can discard these fears away. My life has been upside down since then. 
Has anyone here been in my position? How did you overcome it?"
Anxiety,Thinking of changing therapist. Is this a good reason or am I being impatient?,"I went to the same therapist for 3 years (on and off because of time spent abroad). This summer I realized that I was not making enough progress and that I wanted to try a different method and made the tough decision to change therapist and choose someone specialised in EMDR.  However after three months with this new therapist I feel almost worse..  the EMDR sessions don't really work and she seems to judge me or ""reprimand"" me if I am afraid of using the exposure techniques she frequently suggests. In our last session she was particularly bossy and I noticed that my defenses were going up big time. As in, I started feeling very uncomfortable and threatened, and thought that this is not a good fit and that I should change therapist. I had already been noticing small things that did not really work for me (whereas my previous therapist was very accepting and non-judgemental), but this time I really had the feeling that I could not open up and that I had to protect myself.   
Is this a good reason to find a new therapist *again*? It is exhausting to explain my issues all over again, but I also want this to work, I need my anxiety to get better. Any advice is most welcome."
Anxiety,Feeling tired all day despite getting full sleep.,I get full sleep but still… i wake up tired and get tired throughout the day. Anyone else experience this shit?
Anxiety,In what ways did CBT work for your anxiety issues?,"I have never tried CBT but I'm now looking for a therapist specialised in this method. I have GAD and used to have panic attacks. I have been feeling increasingly afraid of either passing out in public or when driving, and have a fear of losing control or being physically weak. I have tried talk therapy, EMDR and family-focused therapy, but I know that CBT is the most scientifically proven approach for anxiety issues. I am looking for personal experiences that illustrate how it worked for certain issues and/or how it didn't really work for other issues. I am afraid that CBT will only consist in exposure strategies that might trigger my panic attacks again."
Anxiety,I wish I got on that plane,"I am regretting not getting on that plane so much. I am not truly happy where I am. I am just going with the flow of things, and I hate my job and my situation.

I wish I never had met my ex, life would be very different right now."
Anxiety,Chemophobe and I hate it,"Hey guys, recently (past few months) I have been super super stressed, every where I look I see something that is dangerous and I get super paranoid. So I do hours of research until I feel satisfied with the answer I get. At this point I am so tired of this bullshit, how I'm always freaking out at the things that could 'harm' myself. I feel like I'm not like the chemophobe definition, I don't freak out over the word 'chemical', because ik chemicals are all around us. I only freak out when it could be a possible toxin or carcinogen or plastic. PLASTIC, Idk why and I hate it, when ever I see plastic, I imagine the material to be covered with plastic dust that will get on my hands when ever I touch it. Just today my friends wanted to play frisby, but when I saw the scratched frisby, I was so scared of even touching it or getting close to it because I'm scared that there might be loose plastic particles that may be in the air or get on my hands when I touch it, and then end up in my body. Even with zip lock plastic food bags, im scared of putting anything inside because I'm scared there might be loose plastic particles in it (I always imagine it to be dust, or particles). Someone please help, this is beginning to take a toll on me and to the point where I'm cleaning everything like 3 times a day just because I don't want to absorb chemicals/ dirty stuff. I'm scared to die..."
Anxiety,Am I feeling more anxious because I'm self-isolating? Or have I just ignored my feelings because I've been so busy? HELP,[removed]
Anxiety,"Please help, scared for life"," 

I have been on 200mg Zoloft (sertraline) for about 2+ years now and 3 months on 80mg Propanolol (bedranol).

About 6 weeks ago I tried to lower my dosage from 80mg propranolol to 0mg and 200mg to 100mg (without consulting my doctor (i know that was dumb of me)). After about a week of doing so, I felt fine and decided to lower it to 0. After about another week I felt insanely anxious and went straight back to 200mg and 80mg of propranolol. I was fine for 2-3 weeks.

9 days ago I started getting really bad symptoms.

I will list them here: Different types of headaches, Dizzyness (Feeling of falling forwards), Nerve pain in my face, Small amounts of chest pain, Muscle pains, Confusion, muscle twitches, slight earache, and throat ache

These symptoms come and go throughout the day, but the main one is dizziness and headaches. These symptoms are also a lot worse when I am stressed, nervous, or searching symptoms up. They also seem to be worse after sleeping. When I am distracted they also don't bother me as much.

I am seriously worried that I have something wrong with me more than medication side effects and just need some sort of confirmation from anyone that it is just side effects because this is ruining my life.

My doctor told me that it is more than likely just side effects and I should give it time. But I'm really scared it's worse. These symptoms completely ruin my day, and I can't really do anything other than sleep or play on my PC.

Please tell me if this is normal :(."
Anxiety,"Felt on edge and on verge of anxiety attack throughout my classes and work,is this normal?",I’ve always had some sort of anxiety like most people but recently had a anxiety attack at work and now been feeling like it’s about to happen more and more especially during class and work. Is this normal for people who don’t know how to manage? Im don’t know anybody super knowledgeable about stuff like this so anything will help.
Anxiety,15F At a loss,"I almost feel pathetic in posting this, knowing I haven’t struggled as severely or for as long as most of the other people here. 

I’ve been on mirtazapine 15mg for 4 months now - early on it felt as though my anxiety was totally ‘cured’, but after a minor event where I broke down crying and begging for the car to be pulled over on a busy highway, debilitating anxiety has consumed me.

That in itself isn’t entirely my concern; it’s how it’s affecting my family that worries me. I don’t let my family or pets go outside, I don’t let them chop vegetables or be around an open flame - I don’t let them do anything without me there. I know they’re competent, but I am so thoroughly terrified about them getting hurt at all that I micro manage everything they do.

I hate this so much, I don’t want to be like this, but what can I even do?"
Anxiety,panic after sex (sti) (NSFW),"I've met a man and we got laid, we were feeling quite horny so we did stuff, however only oral stuff, but I think I might have swallowed pre cum. I've been checking my genitals 24/7 to see if I have any sore or cut (he also did oral sex to me), but thankfully none, but I still can't get over the idea. He said he was ""clean"" meaning he doesn't have sti's, but anxiety doesn't care about words. The problem is even with HIV it takes weeks if not months to be detectable and I'm afraid tests are not cheap (I don't want to ask my mother for money to do a sti test). I know risk of infection through oral sex is very low... but very low doesn't mean 0."
Anxiety,After the panic attack at work,"After the panic attack at work, it takes hours to chest pain and confusion to subside.

I will go get 2d-echo tomorrow just to make sure it is not heart failure or heart attack. long-lasting chest pain and confusion never happened before, now I'm ruling out the possibility that there's something wrong."
Anxiety,Being corona positive with health anxiety is hell… could someone calm me down?,"I (32) got the news this morning. I am vaccinated twice since July, but have been struggling with health anxiety since months anyways. 
Also, I have asthma. I am scared to death… 
Could someone calm me down please?"
Anxiety,"Have you ever seen or felt something on your body that has been there for a long time, but your anxiety says, ""Wait. Are we sure you have always had that? Maybe we need to ruminate and google until you are convinced you're dying...""","I do this about once a month. Last month I was convinced I had a very rare genitic disorder. This month I'm worried about nerve damage or some disease that causes toe numbness (when in reality, I probably have always just had numbness in the calluses on my feet...) How about you all? What has your anxiety tried to make you over analyze about lately? Lol"
Anxiety,Does anyone else think they look physically unhealthy?,Like sometimes i look in the mirror and i think i look so pale and skinny it really gets me down. Ive asked so many people if they think i look ill and they all say i look healthy
Anxiety,Looking for Reassurance,"Ok so I’ve (m) been obsessing over something which has happened and I feel it’s having an impact on my daily life now.

Three weeks ago I had a ONS. I was drunk, we used protection but it broke but I realised before let’s say I shot my shot. For that reason I just carried on, got tested for STI’s and all was good.

Then last week the other person messaged me worried as she had not had her period. But then proceeded to say it was already late by two days when we did the deed. She then did a test which was negative (12 days after). She has explained to me that she doesn’t want children from her own womb and if an accident has happened, she’d terminate. 

So why am I relentlessly obsessing over this? Constantly wanting to message her for reassurances? It’s the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing at night. My life will be ruined, I’ll have to give up my career, any future relationships. 

I am questioning the what if’s, despite her assurances, what if the test was wrong? What if she is pregnant and never has symptoms and it’s too late to terminate? 

It’s affecting my health. What can I do?"
Anxiety,How to cope with emotions in situation when company excuses for unprovided services?,"Hello. I have sent a pair of glasses for repair and did not get response from comoany as early as expected (usually, they guarantee a quick repair). When one week has passed, I have contacted the company for information on ongoing services and they politely explained that they could not do all requested maintainance work because of material specifics. They offered a more basic solution with no charge for that.
I feel guilty for some reason. How do I cope with this sitution? Should I donate them instead?"
Anxiety,How to get Adult ADHD diagnosis on NHS? (UK),"Hello,

I've suffered anxiety along depression bouts for as far back as I remember but I've only recently started researching ADHD and have come to find that a lot of my feelings, behaviors and reactions seem consistent with the symptoms of ADHD. 

I've looked at having this assessed but it is something I cannot afford privately. I'm not sure how I would start this process through the NHS - could anyone provide some guidance on how you were successful in being diagnosed this way?"
Anxiety,Anxiety over work,"So I've had anxiety for a few years now. Started after a vicious break up, lots of codependancy bs etc.

I have high pressure financial job. I have daily target and then I have random checks on what I do. I've been at this new place for a few months and passed every single random check (which is extremely rare).

I failed a check on Friday which meant I had to go back into a 2 day training thing. I finally completed it 2 hours ago and then an hour later.. Received another failed check.

I was anxious enough as it is and now I'm really struggling. Everyone fails but nobody fails twice in a row?

I'm just so gutted and I have to do the training thing again and I was just relieved to have finished it and now I'm back there. I cried a bit and I just feel so much pressure.

Everyone else who works the same job never feels like this. It isn't a huge issue to them but I'm so stressed over it. My heart keeps pounding and im a mess.

Idk why I'm posting this but I just need someone to say it's okay. Shit happens."
Anxiety,Bathroom anxiety in public is the worst,Going to the bathroom just to come back to class and feel like I have to use the bathroom
Anxiety,anxiety got so bad my limbs went numb,"pretty much what the title says, yesterday i freaked out so badly my hands went semi-numb and tingly in the span of a couple seconds, while my legs went completely numb a couple minutes later. it took about 15 minutes for the tingling to stop, and according to google my blood vessels were contracting or something. not a fun experience, but i was wondering if anyone had similar stories"
Anxiety,Im trying to deal with overthinking and it's getting worse,"Im so insecure and Im going in a worse and worse mindset. There is a one person that I really want to talk to about all of this but I feel like i'll just push them away more and more by doing this, or make them feel bad, or be too much for them.
I want to go to a therapist but my mom would most surely brush me off as I would be ""exaggerating"". 
I don't know what im supposed to do. 
I don't want to keep making people worry and I don't want them to know how hard it is but at the same time I wish someone was there for me , someone that can push me through this. I know im rambling and I know I'm in so many pieces mentally right now. That's why this text will probably not make any sense but I have another post that I made. Hopefully that's more put together. I don't want to feel like this. I want to feel good, be fun and be sure that I won't get left.

Anxiety,Physical feelings,Anyone else get weird physical feelings? Example when I’m in class and sitting and I get anxiety attack I feel like I’m peeing my pants and it makes me anxiety even worse. Anyone else get this kind of feeling or sensation?
Anxiety,Super weird sensation in my head,"So I wanted to ask about a particular thing that happens to me usually when I'm feeling overwhelmed or just annoyed by something and it always seems super weird to me.

It feels like there is physically something inside my head that should be taken out. It's not a headache and it doen't hurt at all. It's just annoying, irritating and really really uncomfortable. How I've been describing it to myself is like there is a stick/thorn inside my head. The sensation doesn't really remind me of anything else but if I had to compare it to something then maybe if there was a tiny rock in my shoe that got stuck between my toes or something. It almost feels like a mosquito biting you... When you first see it and it's not that bad at but the more you focus on the mosquito the worse it gets. 

I was just wondering if anyone has ever had the same experience? 

 I'm not even sure if it's anxiety related but it usually happens when there is something bothering me.

Thanks for reading"
Anxiety,Do some of you have these intrusive thoughts?,"Like when you see someone or see a post where a person says they got drunk or high and for some reason your head just starts turning them into a bad person for drinking or smoking weed?

Like I don't know why does this happen?

Like on subs like r/crushes, r/love or r/dating and I see that some people say they got high or drunk with their partner and suddenly these thoughts come in where I start to judge these people when before I just thought ""oh cool they have fun"".

Anyone feels the same?"
Anxiety,"Dentist filed tooth without asking if it was okay first, please help","Hey guys, I already have health anxiety so this just causing me to spiral. A dentist filed a natural tooth so it can fit better with the opposing tooth below it, which is crowned. I didn’t want her to file my natural tooth. Our enamel wears away already as we eat and age and I was trying to remineralize my teeth not have some of it shaved off. She didn’t even tell me what she was doing she just went in with the drill and started filing it. She then filed the crowned tooth as well. That side of my mouth feels like it’s too low or something. I didn’t want her to do anything I just wanted her to CHECK it. If she would have asked me first I would have never in a million years let her file my natural tooth structure. The appointment was so fast. My health anxiety is killing me. Please help"
Anxiety,"My wife isn't interested in anything intimate, what can we do?","Background: My wife and I have been having issues with intimacy for probably about a year now. She's been getting her doctorate in Pharmacy and it's obviously been stressful, especially since last year was the ""hard year,"" tacking on COVID and stress over my custody battle that ended in August. She's had a diagnosed anxiety disorder for a long time, but in the last year it seemed to get a lot worse. We've been ""intimate"" maybe once a month at most, and even then, especially recently, it's seemed like she's just doing it so I'll stop asking and clearly isn't interested whatsoever. We just got married back in May, but we didn't do anything intimate until maybe 2 weeks later. She doesn't even enjoy kissing me at this point but insists that she still loves me and wants to enjoy things together, she just... doesn't.

I'm not really sure what's normal here, and I don't know how to help. She takes Wellbutrin daily and Hydroxizine as necessary. She's tried a couple other medications but they didn't seem to do as much for her anxiety. I try to be supportive but obviously it's hard when I constantly get rejected and can't help but feel like she doesn't want me anymore. I've struggled with anxiety, to a lesser extent but I do take Hydroxizine as needed, and depression and I just feel like I'm spiraling back into those as this goes on.

So my questions come down to: 
1) Is this normal?
2) Does it get better eventually?
3) Is there anything I can do to help?
4) Any other advice or coping mechanisms?"
Anxiety,School is making me so anxious and I can’t even get away from it when I sleep,"Hey 

I am an electrical engineering student at the University of Minnesota. School is stressing me out so bad that I’m having nightmares about it. Last night I had two nightmares about school that both woke me up. One of them I dreamt that I had completely forgot about a class I signed up for and the other I had some assignment that I had forgot about. 

Right now I’m really worried about my exam grade. I took a test 2 and a half weeks ago and I still haven’t received the score. I felt fine walking out of the test but now I’m getting really worked up about it. The anticipation is killing me! It’s beginning to affect me in other areas of my life. I am struggling to complete assignments because of how long I’ve been fretting about getting my damn score back.

I’m on 20mg of Prozac / Day. Do you think I should talk to my doctor about increasing my dose?"
Anxiety,Drowning in obsessive thoughts,"I honestly sometimes wish I could pack a bag and leave my own head because it’s so hard to do anything when your brain can’t stop obsessing over and over about the same thing. Be that a person, situation, feeling, it’s just SO tiring and it’s really upsetting. I can’t take this anymore, I feel like I am going mad. My brain constantly obsesses over everything, there is no peace.

I did CBT and that helped me loads but it was focused mostly on my anxiety and thoughts of fear, and while I am better now I can’t stop the obsessive thoughts about more harmless things. It’s not dangerous and it doesn’t brings anything bad to my life but it’s so tiring and frustrating. Just sick of it.

Anyone struggles with this as well? I feel like I am going mad sometimes as I can only thing about the same thing over and over and over. Usually it goes away with time but then something else happen and a new obsession starts and its just too much. I also feel embarrassed to tell anyone about because I am scared they will think I am nuts. Appreciate any help."
Anxiety,How long did it take you for side effects to level out after an increase?,"I’ve been on Paxil 10mg for 6-7 weeks about. It worked okay I think. Then I started having gastro distress and thought maybe it was side effects from Paxil. Dropped down to 5mg for 3 days and it wasn’t that. I figured out that stress and anxiety was causing my stomach problems. So my psych suggested going up to 20mg. I’ve been on 20mg for 3 days now. A little dizzy, and my anxiety is really high. How long did it take you to level out after increase?"
Anxiety,"That feeling when you finally find something to save your money up for on Amazon, but as you’re saving for it, you slowly watch almost all of them get taken.","Every time I’d get allowance in the past I ended up spending it all because U have nothing that I want to save it up for. I’m constantly doing chores, taking care of my sister, sometimes even doing my brother’s chores, cleaning things, etc.
Recently, I found the most precious stuffed animal on Amazon. I’ve never desperately wanted something so outrageously expensive yet so very cute in my life.
I have been patiently saving my money for the past two weeks and I saw today that there’s only one left in stock. I’m not sure when I’ll get my allowance again, but if I don’t get to buy this stuffed animal I will most definitely cry myself to sleep. I’m so scared that the next time I go on Amazon they’ll be all gone and I’ll have saved my money for nothing! :)"

Anxiety,I cannot stop the thoughts of impending doom,"TW: dying/death

Today I am in a perpetual anxiety state, like I am just having one long ongoing panic attack. My whole body is trembling. Like every nerve in my body hurts and is buzzing. 

I cannot stop the thoughts that I am going to die. I go to therapy and she tells me that the only way to combat this is to not allow yourself to obsessively think, but I can’t stop. I pace my living room back and forth thinking about dropping dead at that moment. 

This especially happens right before I get my period (TMI) when my hormones are crazy. 

I cannot calm down. Any words of affirmation would really help right now."
Anxiety,Anxiety for no reason?,"My anxiety is at its highest at the moment, has been for weeks.

The thing is, I haven't actually got anything to be anxious about at the moment. There is actually nothing bad going on nor anything to worry about.

Anyone else relate to this?"
Anxiety,Probably the worst day of college ever and it's a shame because it could've been the best but it all got ruined.,"I was driving to my college campus like every day ever when I bumped into a metal fence around the entry curve. The security came in and took photos of my car's damage and pics of my ID. Fortunately I didn't damage any properties but I could be wrong, and I'm in a constant suspense to receive a phone call follow-up. I felt like absolute garbage during the whole day. It's ironic because I was having a small talk with my neighbor yesterday and he mentioned praising me for my driving improvements ever since I started a few months ago. I originally came to campus a bit early because I wanted to snack on something, but the incident ruined it for me and I lost my appetite. At one point in the classes my stomach even started rumbling constantly which embarrassed me so much.

During a short time gap between classes, I received a phone call from college. The thing about student affairs is that they check your schedule and wait until you're free before ringing up. And I said fuck this, I'm probably getting blasted with a large fine or maybe even prohibited from parking again. But turns out it's because they called because they want me to represent an upcoming sustainability campaign. They still had my contacts because I participated and won in an online design tournament revolving around environmentalism around a year ago, and now they want me back. 0 mentions of the accident. Apparantly they need one male and one female and I've been specifically invited to partake the role so I couldn't refuse this huge opportunity. They ended the call with saying they'll inform me with further instructions ""soon.""

If anything, I'm conflicted. I returned home feeling so defeated and shitty that I just threw myself on the bad and took a 4 hours nap. It's 6pm now and I just realized I haven't eaten a single thing."

Anxiety,DAE Anxiety is driving me to be impulsive,"I’ve been battling a really bad bout of anxiety/panic for the last 5 months ( I have NP and therapist) I’ve seem to become impulsive to try and ease my anxiety. A random task pops into my mind and it makes me anxious, so I have the urge to do it immediately, so I do. Even if it’s something that doesn’t need to be done right then or even at all. Ex. It may be rational like the need to vacuum, take the garbage out, mow the yard. Or it may be irrational, like going to the store for something that we don’t need at the moment or something that can easily wait. The thing I notice is after I do it, another task or urge,  rapidly follows and the cycle repeats. 

Anyone else experience this or sound familiar? 

Anyone else ever get like this?"

I know this sounds stupid, but I’m constantly aware of my heart rate even when I am completely still and at rest. My resting heart rate is about 60bpm so it’s perfectly normal but I just can’t seem to stop being aware of it. When I constantly think about it, it makes me really anxious to the point of almost having a panic attack sometimes."

I'm feeling a lot better. No massive anxiety spikes because of click baity articles.

Anxiety,Had a breakdown on the phone to my GP today.,"I started escitalopram in the hope that it would quell some frequent panic attacks. I got through the first week which was hell. Day 12 and I broke down. Everyday was pure panic, ribs hurting and mind racing. I am so scared but the doctor was lovely. She told me to stop immediately and have a face to face with her on Monday which is rare now due to covid. Has anyone experienced something similar. I had to keep moving because the jitters were so bad. Almost as if I had took 30 coffees. The nausea I experienced too was absolutely unbelievable. I am now worn out tired depressed and I wasn't depressed before I decided to start the tab. Any support would be welcome right now."
Anxiety,How to help others understand your anxiety disorder?,"My anxiety is so bad. It makes me physically sick sometimes. 
What’s worst is when the only people in your life don’t know anything about this. They don’t believe it’s a disorder and that everyone experiences worrying sometimes, and that it’s just me over reading and over worrying about things. That this is all just my choice. 
And they tell me there’s ways to control  this and it’s my fault for not doing anything about it. 
They make me feel like this is all my choice, my fault, etc.. 
I can never go to them about any of my anxiety problems because they will just think I’m being absolutely ridiculous and the thing I’m worrying about is so silly. They’ll actually make me feel 100x more terrible.
It makes me feel so alone. They don’t understand how badly I want to be normal, how badly I wish I could stop this.
I’ve been struggling in silence for so long because of this. But it’s hard cause I have to live around them, and they don’t understand my bad days so I have to fake everything. 
It becomes so emotionally mentally and physically exhausting. 
It all makes my anxiety so much worst and puts me back into those bad depressions. 
Sometimes I dream about running away but I know it’s not possible right now."
Anxiety,Really struggling with university.,"I am a mature student and currently studying Biomedical Science. I have been out of education for 2 years as I have crohns disease so I have quite a large gap in my knowledge due to not learning anything for 2 years while being poorly.

I am now in university and my mental health is getting worse and worse as I'm struggling to keep up with the content. Its making me deeply unhappy as I am having to study so much to make up for this. 

I really really don't want to drop out but its making me deeply unhappy. I know if I do drop out I'll majorly regret it down the line but do I just have to suffer for 3 years to get to where I want to be? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,Suicide or Die slowly ?,"Hi I'm 20Y M from India. I'm dealing with Slipped disc, Cervical &amp; Sinusitis (sinus infection) from past 7 months. I had just started doing work as a construction worker this Jan. I injured my back in Feb at the construction site. Then I don't know I started feeling pain in my entire spine for 1 month. In April my spinal &amp; neck pain went at it's peak and I thought I would die. I somehow managed that pain ( didn't had any other option ). Then i got sinus infection due to pneumonia in May. I went to few doctors whatever i could afford, but then reaching out to doctors was out of my budget. Yesterday I was in intense pain &amp; really thought of committing suicide due to no hope. It's been 7 months of this. Today I went to a Dr. for a normal dose of cold &amp; he advised me to do a sinus scan. They did the sinus scan and i have sinus infection from almost 6 months. They said I need to get a surgery for the sinus. I can't afford the surgery, because i only have money to survive this year. I don't have any family or anyone that can help, that's why I started working as construction worker. I don't know what to do, I can't work as a construction worker anymore due to spine issues &amp; if I don't work I won't have money to survive next year. I'm really scared of what will happen next. Either I'm gonna die due to lack of food or I'm gonna die because of this pain. I'm stuck now. I'm having suicidall thoughts but I don't have the power to kill myself. I don't want to die like this.. Please anyone suggest me any way that I'm not able to see. I know there's always a door to get out of any situation, but I'm unable to see it due to so much stress 😔🙏"
Anxiety,Unusual anxiety triggers. Care to share yours?,"I have a few anxiety triggers. Health anxiety is common and not unusual, so I'll leave that one off this topic. The one that I think is unusual is car repair anxiety. 

**So, car repair/mechanical condition anxiety.** 

As a car guy, I've always been into cars. But I've always been anxious about them. While it doesn't sound as serious or as scary as health anxieties, it freaking drivers me nuts some days/weeks! It's bad enough to cause me to lose appetite, sleep, and be an agitated mess unable and unwilling to deal with stuff like work, relationships, etc. 

When wheeling my 4x4. I'm always worried and my pulse is 100 because I don't want to break anything mechanical. I've plenty of spares, tools and friends that go with me in their rigs, so there's no real danger of being being stranded alone. But still, I can't sleep on those multi-day trips when we camp overnight. I can't function well. I'm socially impaired because of my elevated anxiety. I used to enjoy this so much more, but not any more. I go to fantastic remote places (in Colorado) and as I'm super outdoorsy, this is my dream basically. I just can't enjoy it much most of the time unless I'm on a ton of Xanax (prescribed). 

Then I get home from the trip and crash. Driving around town I'm always listening to noises, checking stuff, and worried about shit being not up to snuff. Needless to say, my cars are maintained flawlessly, haha. 

But. Case in point - I had to get some balljoint work done and the reputable shop in the area destroyed my control arm bushings when reinstalling. I have to wait until next week for owner to be back from vacay and review my case to confirm that they will pay warranty labor for me to fix. I'm sure it will work out fine, but I am SO anxious about. I'm anxious because there's a mechanical issue and I can't do anything about it, even though I don't drive my offroad truck all that much during the week and it can certainly wait until next week. 

I am not a perfectionist in life except my vehicles. Mechanically they have to be perfect. Have to be. I've had a hard time sleeping since this happened a few days ago and waiting until next week is weighing heavily on my mind. 

Why is that I'm triggered by my vehicles so much? I cannot explain it, really."
Anxiety,My anxiety is taking over me finishing my dissertation,"I have what I would call stress anxiety because I only feel it when I am stressed or with a problem, don't know if it is a thing. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and stress-induced gastritis. I have the following symptoms: difficulties concentrating, problems with sleep, apetite, uncontrollable over-thinking, fast heartbeat, lack of energy, stomach aches and sickness, chest tightness and muscle tightning in my case constantly keeping my mouth closed with a lot of force.

I am on the last stage of finishing my dissertation, I have everything up to the analysis of my data. I only need to write about the graphs created and conclude. My deadline is november 30th. 

My anxiety has been getting worse and worse throughout my dissertation partially because I have not gotten any help from my supervisor, literally zero and I struggled so much because I didnt know how to procede. I have since hired a tutor that helped me overcome this problems I had with the actual work.

But now that I am so close I am feeling super bad, the worst thing is I cannot concentrate properly and I struggle to feel motivated to start. This leads me to only do 5% of what I need to do everyday. I dont allow myself to do any other fun thing because I know I need to work on my dissertation but I also dont work on it, and I dont know why! 

At the moment I'm not taking any medication because from past experiences the medication would make me sleep most of the day and I cannot have that happening.

Should I go to the doctor? Anyone has any tips on concentrating or getting motivation? Please help."
Anxiety,I stopped taking my meds while on 10mg. It's been three weeks and i've gone back to being very anxious with some paranoia. Should I hold out?,"Ideally, i'd like to be off the meds but after stopping i've become panicky, anxious and short of breath again, which is a shame because I was really doing well before.

I've been on meds for about 7 months, however, I don't want to be on them forever.

So, do you guys think I should stick it out and see if my symptoms resolve or just bite the bullet and go back on them."
Anxiety,Dealing with Anxiety at Networking Conference,"I have a week-long leadership conference for work next week that will involve lots of collaborating, ""break-out sessions"", idea brainstorming, and networking. I will be there alone, no one from my job will be attending. Basically my worst nightmare haha. I deal with social anxiety and am very self-conscious about my level of knowledge in my industry--it's mostly in my head, but I constantly put myself down over my ""stupidity"" for not knowing something or how to properly explain something and get nervous when people are talking to me about what I do for a living....and this conference will be all about that. 

Any tips on some self-care to do the weekend before and evenings after the conference to keep my anxiety in check? I am not on any medication, and know to avoid alcohol as I have learned that it can heighten it sometimes. I plan on trying to exercise quite a bit and get all the good endorphins flowing but am open to any other suggestions. Thank you in advance :)"
Anxiety,I'm bothered by my friend never engaging on my insta,"I have a friend of 4 years, who I'd say we're good friends. They moved, and its long distance, so there are some expectations and we kept in contact. Recently, I was worried by their late replies, so when we caught up, they explained keeping up with long distance friends is kinda hard due to being busy, which is fair. Thing is, they are engaging with other long distance friends social media like commenting on their posts, which to me say, sounds like if they can't message or text, they are kinda trying to keep in touch with the bare minimum, but they don't do it for me, which makes me feel they just aren't keen on keeping up with me. Plus, I'm the one always texting them first, even if the replies are not dry and always asking to zoom when we do.  It makes me feel anxious they are just not into me, how do I stop overthinking?"
Anxiety,How to cope with anxiety after socializing,"I've cut back on socializing quite a bit and it has definitely  helped out my anxiety,  but the problem  is , I love going out and socializing  ! I have so much fun doing it, but It's after the fact that I'm stuck thinking about every thing I said , who I said it to , how I acted,  how I looked the entire time , if everyone hates me now and never wanted me there , and that everyone thought  I was incredibly annoying. 

EVERY single time I go out and socialize I think about everything  for DAYS afterwards , and get so nervous about seeing those people again.

Anxiety,My anxiety is beginning to become unmanageable on my own. Should I look into medication? Am I just having anxiety brain about my seasonal depression and I need to wait it out?,"Hello, sweet humans. 

I need some advice regarding anxiety. 

So, I'll start out, I'm a 31F. I've had a history with depression before, and took prozac for a year and a half after suffering untreated for many years. I left my husband almost 2 years ago now, and when I left I quit them cold turkey while i experienced a period of regenesis and no longer felt the symptoms of depression. I was great, I quit leaning on food to cope, lost a severe amount of weight and changed my relationship with my body. I started sitting in reflection and becoming aware of my trauma while also working to heal it and become more aware of my emotions and triggers. I became compoundingly happier as I realized a large part of my depression was attributed to my marital circumstances.

I feel I became a healthier person after this period. I eat very well (lots of whole and fresh food), I don't smoke or drink often, and I do my best to be active. Admittedly, I drink a lot of caffeine (black), but I always have. I sleep 5-6 hours a night, I walk 15k steps a day.

It has now been 2 years since I stopped my medication. My life has settled into its new form. I am with an amazing man whom I love deeply and our relationship feels very healthy, although I am aware I have lingering co-dependant tendencies (Working on it as it comes up- I'm on it) (I am anxiously attached, he is securely attached. Relevant, idk?). My child is happy and healthy. I have stable employment with the excitement (and stressed) of starting a degree on the horizon, and my fridge is always full and bills paid.

I feel confident in saying I am an optimistic, upbeat person who can easily reach for gratitude and feels mamu moments of appreciation and happiness.

However, I am experienced wild anxiety. I normally struggle with SAD. I Have managed this moment to moment in the past. Last fall I noticed that the week before my period I would become WILDLY anxious, peaking in a devastating anxiety attack days before I began to menstruate. I saw my doctor and recieved a prescription for Clonazepam, which I take as needed. I have noticed over my last couple cycles that my anxious period seems to be extending beyond my PMS window. Before having been 1 week, now it's almost 3. I feel like my normal clear headed and confident self for a week after my cycle and then I descend into this cycle of anxiety and paranoia. 

I do my best to communicate with my loved ones, and especially my partner, what I am feeling and when. But my wounds are absolutely magnified during this period. I feel down about work, I feel scared that my partner will decide my emotions are too heavy or I am not being engaging enough and leave (we have had many discussions about this, he is very emotionally stable and patient and assures me that my feelings don't scare him), I pull away from my friends because I fear that my feelings are too much and people won't understand them. It's just too much. I don't have the motivation I am used to. I am not my usual, optimistic, take-life-by-the-horns self. 

So. Is it time for anxiety medication? This all seems so much bigger than ""Stop drinking caffeine"". 

I am also, hoenstly, afraid to take medication that will have side effects. I absolutely am unwilling to take medication that will cause me to gain weight, but otherwise I am not opposed to it. 

Advice? Thoughts? Power through until spring? Have any of you been in similar situations and found effective ways to manage? 

I'm just getting sick of feeling on top of the work and then having my anxiety brain suddenly pipe in with ""You'll never be happy because you're actually a secretly bad person and you don't deserve good things.""

Anxiety,Should I quit my anxiety meds?,"I've been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication for about 3 years now. Over all this time, I've never been able to find something that actually works consistently for me without side effects that outweigh the benefits.

I still deal with my generalized anxiety disorder and my issues with depression. It's hard for me to remember exactly what I was like before I was on medication because it's been so long. But I can't imagine it was any worse than this.

I started with Lexapro and Buspirone at first, they worked pretty well, but eventually I grew a tolerance so my doctor raised my dosage. We kept doing this until I was on the highest dose possible.

Eventually, we switched from Lexapro to Wellburtin because Lexapro was effecting my libito too much.

I've been on Wellbutrin for almost 6 months and I still feel nauseous almost every day. I walk around like a zombie and get lost in thought and I can't focus on where I am or what I'm doing.

I feel like I'm ready to give up on medication and go back to raw dogging life.

Do you think I should ask my doctor to let me start weaning off? I'm not going to change anything before she gives me the OK to do so."
Anxiety,Struggling with separation anxiety and social anxiety,"I am 23M (Asian), but disabled with mobility and hearing difficulties, and so my parents have always been around me for as long as I remember. Very rarely they let me see my friends alone, but they'll spam me with texts if I am away for 30 minutes too long, and they keep asking me to keep them on tab on where I am. If I don't, they will become very angry at me, and stonewall me for many hours or even days when I get home.

I'm now a working adult but I'm really suffering from social anxiety and separation anxiety. My self-esteem is very very low, and on some days, I realized how low my self-esteem was when I cannot even stand for myself and do the right thing. I am always having to seek my parents' permission on this or that, and I get very very anxious when they cannot help me out on my troubles. 

But now with Covid, it's even worse. My dad is not allowing me to see my friends, trying to fear-trip me whenever possible, using the oh-so-famous ""better not go out of the house or you get covid"" mantra. It has been working with my mom very well (she's not allowed by my dad to have any friends or relatives come over to our house or go out at all even before I was born). It's beginning to work with me, I guess. 

And my parents have forced me to stop physiotherapy for 5 years (and still counting) and disallowed me to take up any para sports in university. Now that I've graduated, they've begrudgingly allowed me to take up a new para sport over last weekend (that I went to register without their approval first), but they've been very negative about me taking up any form of para sports. I was at the trial lesson just last weekend, and they left me alone there, leaving me to struggle with my separation and social anxieties alone with the coach... 

Please, **any advice much appreciated on how to manage with my social and separation anxieties**. I can't move out on my own, I can't live independently. And no helpers or other caregivers are accepted in my household too. My parents bullied them very badly the last time we had helpers.

I don't know if my parents are suffering from any kind of paranoia themselves. 

But they will laugh if they see me or anyone in pain.

I'm trying to see a counsellor/therapist soon. Already signed up at a mental wellness center."
Anxiety,Am I having FOND or FOMO?,"Several days ago I searched in Reddit and found 3 interesting posts about FOMO.

At first, I was very glad and satisfied, because based on their titles, I think those posts could be helpful or inspiring for me.

But when I was going to read one of them in detail, I just found myself getting trapped in a very strong anxious feeling. I just can't focus on the sentences or words I was reading at all because I can't get rid of the idea of reading one of the other 2 posts instead. I just wished that I could read them all simultaneously, but actually I can only read them one by one, one after one.

As I can remember, I've been suffering from this kind of anxiety since when I was in middle school. Each time I was about to study, I would always find it extremely hard to decide which subject  to begin with, maths, physics, chemistry...? It could drive me crazy. I've even developed a defending/escaping mechanism for it. I would look at the floor around the chair I was sitting, from the left to the right, and tell myself that nothing important has been left on the ground, to calm myself down a little bit. If it didnt work well, I would try it several more times, again and again, like some kind of compulsive behavior.

Can anyone relate to this kind of feeling? If possible, please give me some advice. Please. I really need some. Sharing any thoughts about this would be greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,Anxiety stealing joy from finally achieving a long-held dream,"We recently purchased a home that speaks to a very, very important and long-time dream I have held (returning to the countryside). This home and property have just about everything I had hoped for (woods, cozy, a special view of the sunsets), but my anxiety is completely stealing the joy out of it. The anxiety is latching onto how the house is situated on the property and a neighboring roof out the back, and my mind is completely fixated on this as a negative; so much so, that I am having a difficult time enjoying what I (often painfully) waited years upon years to achieve. I feel like I am drowning in this fixating thought-pattern and am full of guilt that it has made me some kind of an ingrate. 

I won't get into the specifics on the years of trauma I experienced in my youth for space and brevity, but suffice it to say I have been in therapy off and on for 20 years and have also been on medication to help it. I fear this post makes me come across as some out-of-touch person of priviledge; I promise you, I come from humble beginnings, experienced abandonment and a broken home, so I am just at a loss as to why this is happening when superficially so much good is in place! I was not at all prepared for the onslaught of mixed emotions now that we are finally here- and it is all under the guise of being able to see this roof out the back, and our driveway running near theirs. The anxiety is also driving me to compare this home to the home in the countryside in my earliest years of life.

I feel utterly crazy for trying to explain this. I just keep thinking ""if only that house wasn't down there so I couldn't see it on my back porch... If only that other driveway wasn't so close to ours..."" On a loop, constantly. All I wanted was to achieve this dream with my family and experience the joy and gift. And my anxiety and obsessive thought patterns are destroying it. 

Thank you for listening. I know you guys understand the plight. 

Tl;dr: finally achieved a very long-held dream of moving to the countryside; anxiety is a jerk and stealing the joy by latching onto perceived negatives and causing incessant intrusive thoughts"

Anxiety,Help with dentist anxiety?,"I suffer from extreme anxiety and I recently felt a little bit of a temporary numb pain in my back up tooth and upon examination I spotted a very small brown dot that is obviously a cavity. The pain is so minor and has only popped up a couple times but I know I need to fix this asap or it will only get worse. 

Does anyone here know anything about this type of thing to help ease my nerves? I am so scared of tooth removals, route canals etc and I am probably being way to serious about it but I need some reassurance that a minor cavity pain is usually fixed with a simple filling."
Anxiety,I don’t know where else to post this but it has me extremely anxious (T/W politics),"Sorry about the politics, but this is near-panic inducing for me and I’d like help regardless of political affiliation. The election yesterday reminded me that if Trump runs again in 2024 I will disown any family, friends etc. that support him. I’m so furious he tried to steal the 2020 election that he clearly didn’t win and multiple republican backed recounts since then have proven it. Even the farce of the Arizona recount that was designed to help him win showed he didn’t win. Of course reality doesn’t matter to him, he already gaslit himself into believing he won and he took a bunch of his followers with him. He is a huge POS and anyone who supports him is too, in my opinion. I understand part of my problem is hate and I’d like to fix that, sorry in advance if any Trumpers read this.

Basically if he runs and gets the GOP nomination, American democracy is over. He will cheat his way in via the new voting restrictions in Republican states like Georgia, and he will likely win the electoral college even though more Americans will vote for someone else. It just pisses me off so much that someone can try and lie, cheat and steal something like this.

I’m sorry again about bringing in politics, if this isn’t the right forum let me know what might be. Thanks."
Anxiety,Self-sabotage Through Procrastination.,"I've found it extremely difficult lately to get myself motivated to do any type of work. I eventually will get it done, but the process is just.. exhausting. 

I spend so much time beforehand worrying and overthinking on each detail, that when the time comes, I push the task off, sleep, etc and heavily regret it. It's the same cycle each time. I feel such heavy anxiety thinking about starting the task and perhaps possibly screwing it up. It's so scary. 

I'm pretty much sabotaging myself. As a side note, I have no idea how I've held down jobs and gotten promotions, like I'm scamming everyone. Every email or message notification on my work phone is still nerve-wracking. I need to put on a separate work 'persona' to just get through the week.

Even now, I'm putting off a whole list of reports and items to take care of. I'm hating myself because of this. 

Do you guys feel this way too? If so, how are you managing?

It wasn’t a weird time of night, it was 2pm and it was really unexpected for me. For a while now, every time the phone rings my heart races, I get sweaty palms and I struggle to breathe freely. It’s not about answering the phone, just the idea that someone could be calling with terrible news.

Anxiety,Feeling like I’m relapsing,"Hi all,

I just had the best month in a long time in terms of managing my anxiety. The main strategy that I was using was simply letting go and shrugging off anxiety and continuing with my day. It has helped immensely and October was significantly better than I had thought it would be. 

Now it’s November. We’re three days in. My anxiety has been significantly louder than before and my “letting go” strategy is not working as easily as it used to last month. I am wondering why that is. My anxiety is more intense now and thoughts circle around and around. 

Maybe I’m holding myself to too high of a standard and expecting myself to be the same, if not better, than last month. I know that healing is not linear, but there’s this internal conflict where I’m telling myself everything is okay and I believe it, and then a few minutes later my brain says the opposite. 

Anyone feel like this?"

Usually im triggered by something in my dating life and it tends to spiral from there. Once I get over the episode, my mind goes quiet and it’s like the sea again. Im no longer upset. No longer feel the tingling in my chest. No longer overly self critical. And my journal ceases. I go back and read what I write, and it makes me sad or sometimes I feel so awkward about reading it. I feel like I’m peeking into someone else’s privacy–even though it’s all mine.

Anxiety,Does anyone have stressful dreams a lot about about being back in high school or I guess any time in school,I wouldn’t call them nightmares per se although they’re as stressful as them. Sometimes I dream every night of being back there. I know it has to do with the bullying I endured but also wanting to go back and do things again…feeling like I missed out…and how awful things have turned out. Wanting a second chance and starting over there. I just had a dream that woke me about a girl I rly liked but was too much of a coward to engage really even at this party we were both at by chance once. Anxiety really has ruined my life since day 1 and I can’t even escape in my sleep anymore. I’m so alone and so tired of this fucking shit.
Anxiety,I need someone to talk to about my issues,"So to simplify what's wrong is, next year I want to go to this arts school that is LGBT+ and has a musical class that I want to get into because I want to be a musician; But the issue is the transport; It takes nearly an hour to get to the school, so this would mean that I'd have to take the train, but I've struggled with it before and one time it didn't go so well. If I could speak to someone that would be great please."
Anxiety,"How can I be this reckless, knowing how anxious I get. (Long)","Trigger Warning: Mention of Alcohol, Self-hate, Suicide

NOTE: If there is somewhere else I ought to go with this post, please let me know. I know this may seem un-serious, not necessarily life-threatening, but stuff like this gets life-threatening to me.

I cannot sleep because of this tattoo I've gotten today. I hope this is proper for the anxiety subreddit. I feel it's beyond a tattoo subreddit. I don't know what else I would describe this feeling as in one word but anxiety. If I could simply go back less than 12 hours I would be relatively okay. But now I am here. I cannot stop watching videos on tattoo anxiety and removal. I'd have to wait 6 weeks. I'd have to gather up x amount of thousands of dollars. And I might even like it after all. But right now I am completely without peace. Why do I do this to myself? 

I looked at the design the artist drew up, which wasn't the exact thing I wanted. And I KNEW it wasn't. But I just played things cool, like I always do, and I was like, ""yeah, that's fine."" And it was a fine design, but I feel like if I got those 12 hours back to do this over, I would be CONSIDERABLY morepicky about the design and way more assertive about what I didn't like or wanted to change.

I'm the most relaxed and simultaneously fragile person sometimes. Like if I was confident enough to voice myself, and even just be visibly reflective of my mental state, I wouldn't have to deal with bad decisions and then the compounded feeling of guilt knowing I could have prevented the decisions if I were a more well-adjusted person. Sometimes I literally cannot believe how casual I make bad decisions. It's like I'm watching myself in 3rd person. I am watching everything play out and going, ""no."" But then I'll say, ""yeah, that's fine.""  

And I told myself, like justifying this, that, ""I can't draw, so there's only so much accuracy I'm gonna get with the image in my head."" I even figured, ""It's good to give the artist some artistic license to do the thing."" And I hate that because those thoughts WORKED and put me in the headspace to keep avoid conflict. It's reckless but also just that I clam up. And instead of clamming up completely I'll go through with things I really don't want.

This recklessness gets me through tattoos, or into drinking dangerous amounts of alcohol (I blacked out and nearly ruined my mind once. I still really haven't recovered from the paranoia.) Or buying a subscription to barnes and noble that I didn't actually want, and finding a reason to avoid the conflict of getting a refund. This type of stuff, it makes me feel dumb, and like child. For all the school I've been going too, I just do the dumbest things sometimes, and create difficult, preventable situations to get in. And then I'll end up in my room, ruminating, crippled, and stuck, doing research on things like how to get a tattoo removed, HOURS after the fact.

I could just go and cry to my mom or something right now about it. But then the next minute I'll like the damn thing. As of now, I don't know. It's too shiny with ointment. I'm almost too tired to keep dwelling for the moment. I sure hope this feeling goes and i have some peace. And I hope I like it after all and I'm just going through something at the moment. I hope this is worthy of the subreddit. It was freeing to express this. I tried going to an anxiety hotline, and they were talking about conspiracy theories. It's also 3 am where I am.

Thank you for listening."
Anxiety,Mental Breakdown,"I’m having a mental breakdown, I can’t sleep, I haven’t been eating much, I don’t know what to do, I have to go to school today and it’s 3 am, I have to wake up at 6. My thoughts with OCD and worried is keeping me up. I’ve been feeling like this for days, help."
Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel emotionally numb after being overwhelmed by their anxiety?,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this sub and I need your help with what I'm going through right now.

The last two days I haven't felt a flicker of emotion. Nothing. I've had this before recently for a few days but thankfully I started to feel my emotions again but I don't know how I did it.

The pandemic has been rough of my mental health, I've always been anxious but the last few months have been considerably worse, I've struggled with health anxiety and constant thoughts about the future which has overwhelmed me.

I believe this numbness is a coping mechanism, but I would rather feel positive and negative rather than nothing.

Has anyone been through something similar, are there any tips to break through this?

Thanks for the taking the time to read this, I appreciate it."
Anxiety,Slept another day away...,"So, I was pretty much forced to retire as my 26+ year teaching career had become impossible for me as a result of the pandemic. I had little or no choice but to move back 'home' to my mother's basement. I am divorced and over 50. 

I find it difficult to interact with my mom as she is in her own world, telling me the same stories of her childhood (and my childhood) over and over again. I mean, I get it, she's likely suffering some mental decline, but I really don't like interacting with her if I can avoid it. 

She outright SCREAMED at me the other day when I said I had plans and the grass cutting would have to wait a day. So I succumbed to her bullying/intimidation tactics - I dropped everything and promptly went out and cut her fucking grass for her. But the whole affair left a very bad taste in my mouth.

Honestly, at this point, I don't want to even be awake at the same time of day as her anymore. So I sleep all day and stay up all night. Now she's complaining that she wants me to check in daily as she's worried that 'I'm dead down there.'  So I try to spin it as a positive - ""I guess that means that I must be a nice, quiet, clean, respectful tenant - you can't even tell I'm here"". But she won't even concede the point I'm trying to make. 

I cook for her and leave food out for her with a note and she seems to respond to that. 

Honestly, I can tell she's kind of lonely. She actually called me on my cell phone to ask me to come upstairs to talk to her - but this was after 3 days of her not seeing me. The conversation was OK but I had to bite my tongue the whole time and listen to her prattle on with her inanities until I couldn't take it anymore. 

I really wish I could help her by being 'there for her' more often but I find her offhand way of criticizing and demeaning me - the way she talks to me, in general, to be infuriating. I can't even look at her when she speaks to me. The conversation always has to be about her. She constantly interrupts me when I'm speaking, to the point that I don't even want to share anecdotes with her that, under other circumstances, I think she might find interesting.

Oh, and by the way, she always starts 'hitting the bottle' by 7 PM so forget trying to have any kind of conversation after 8 PM or so.

I know she won't change and I need to be able to stay here for at least the foreseeable future. So I sleep well into the afternoon only getting up when I can't stand to stay in bed any longer and find myself not drifting off to sleep until after 5 or 6 AM. Today, when I woke up at 2 PM I took some meds and slept until after 7 PM. 

Once again, anxiety has me running away from my problems..."
Anxiety,I'm honestly having a hypochondria panic attack please talk to me,"I've had hypochondria for awhile but it's been heavy lately due to symptoms and things I've been having.

I came across leukemia and bone narrow disease on Google earlier and I just Googled the symptoms a bit ago and been in a panic and anxiety ridden attack since. I was literally crying man. 

It said you don't need symptoms to have it but some of the symptoms are lost in appetite and fatigue, which I have both. 

But then it said a high white blood cell count is a sign, along with a high neutrophil count. Also a high hematocrit levels. I have both at least. And it has be in fuckin panic mode. I had this blood work done in July and the doctor said everything was fine. But the doctor also didn't seem to listen to my concerns the other day when I went there about something else because I've been scared of having a neurological disorder or stomach cancer smh. I'm going to see my moms doctor, but I can't until next Tuesday since he's out this week. 

My blood tests are as shows:

White blood cell count - 13.8, normal range is 4.5 to 11.0

Red blood count - 5.88, normal range is 4.30 to 5.90

My Hemoglobin - 16.5, normal range is 13.5 to 17.5

With these results I'm rereading, along with some bone or muscle pain I have in my legs, it has me really anxious and scared that I have leukemia and/or a bone marrow disease

I know you can't diagnose me over Reddit, and I don't necessarily want you to, but man I am freaking out. It is almost 3:30 am, I've barely eaten today, I was eating a bit, but lose my appetite for a minute, my stomach is still hungry and I want to finish but it's like I can't even eat anymore because of my anxiety 😞

I'm 25, I just started life and I have so much life to live. I alrewdy have a vitamin D deficiency I'm taking supplements for, I have my mom and my 2 year old son to live for. I really really really want to be here but I'm fuckin terrified I won't be and I'm terrified I have something 

I sent a message to the doctor I've been going to a lil bit ago, asking them to please please look into this because either my count is high or some things are bordering and it's really concerning
 
I'm about to try taking a melatonin to get tired and hopefully calm me down, but I can't calm down. Nobody is awake to talk to, I'm just sitting in my room on my thoughts, fears and anxieties. I honestly feel like crying again

Anxiety,Struggling to work because of past burnout,"Hi friends! Hope this is relevant &amp; not too long haha

For context, I spent my first 2ish years after graduating in &amp; out of different jobs. My mental health had taken a dip (I finally got help &amp; went on meds though, which is great!) so I tried out different jobs but didn't last long in any.

After getting help I finally landed a job that I could stick with, but I'm a social media manager &amp; lockdown quadrupled my workload &amp; I experienced the worst burnout, so I left after almost two years at the company.

Two months after leaving that company, last week was my first week at a new job but I just can't seem to get to work. I'm so anxious all the time worrying about work, &amp; it isn't even that stressful. There are little things -like I'm working from home bc of the lockdown so I can't gauge where everyone's at, or I can't read the tone of messages so I just think everyone's mad-, but I think I'm only now kind of realising how all my past experiences have kind of traumatised me from work, &amp; it feels like... I'm just... not able to work. Does that makes sense?

I'm so frustrated bc I just ended therapy a few months ago, everything's been looking up &amp; it just kind of feels like everything's back to what it was at the start. Advice/solidarity/tips welcomed!"
Anxiety,I was so happy to be fully vaccinated with Pfizer and now my anxiety has sabotaged my happiness.,"I've had terrible anxiety my whole life. 

Now that I'm fully vaccinated, I keep stressing over whether the vaccine has actually worked in my body. 

Pfizer is a very fragile and unstable vaccine that needs careful handling and preparation. Ive read that even if you just shake the vial it can become ineffective. 

Knowing this has caused me great anxiety. 

What if the vaccine wasn't stored properly? 
What if they dropped the vial?
What if they let it thaw too long? 
What if they didn't dilute enough of it and I got an extra low dose? 
What if I'm not even vaccinated? 

There is no way to know with 100% certainty that the vaccine worked. Deep down I know it's probably just anxiety. I just want to be certain that the vaccine worked and was properly prepared. 

I would appreciate any advice or strategies on how to overcome these anxious thoughts. 

At this stage my brain is just telling me that I'm not even vaccinated."
Anxiety,"Having a weird anxiety attack, it feels much more “in my head” than my usual ones.","I’m not sure how to describe it, this attack feels weird. Like my head is nearly spinning and suddenly like I almost feel a click, that sends adrenaline throughout my body. Almost like chills, you know the ones you get when you have a cold? Well in my head or brain. 

Has anyone experienced this? I feel like I’m not going to be able to sleep. I’m freaking out."
Anxiety,having a mental breakdown,"these last couple days, my anxiety has increased terribly. im having a bit of a mental breakdown right now and im not sure what to do. i feel like somethings wrong with me. it started when i was having issues with social anxiety and self consciousness a couple days ago. the day before i even felt like i was finally happy but im not sure what happened.

ive never been really able to pinpoint my anxiety because often it comes up for many reasons but i feel like it may be due to relationships i have right now especially with family. my mom and two sisters arent really on good terms, with constant fighting and bitterness especially with my mom. somehow i get involved and it just raises stress. like i said, my mom is always very bitter and yesterday i accidentally did something to upset her and made her upset so she didnt want to talk to me. i genuinely felt bad for doing it and it made me sad the rest of the day until now.

my second theory is just my overall health. ever since i started work, my well being started to get ruined. i stopped going to the gym, i dont eat very much, i drink not enough water, and i dont sleep very good. my sleep was ok until recently where it got ruined again.

im just not sure what to do right now. im trying my best to distract myself with games but im sitting here anxious and wanting to cry, but i feel like i cant let it out. i dont feel like myself, i cant think clearly, i feel very tense, im overthinking literally anything, and im very tired. i didnt get good sleep at all last night. these are my usually symptoms though when i have high anxiety but it feels different somehow. im scared and im just not sure what to do."

Anxiety,THE ZAPS,"
Hey y’all! I’ve been trying my best to deal with anxiety for the past few months. Occasionally, I will get this sharp shooting pain on the top of my head and the back of my head. It literally lasts just a second but it honestly makes me anxious and I was wondering if y’all get these too? I know anxiety causes “brain zaps” but from what i heard most of the time these zaps are not painful at all. 
Let me know! 🤙🏻

Edit: I DO NOT TAKE ANY MEDS NO SSRI OR BENZOS"

Anxiety,I’m (24F)obsessing over a lie I told my now BF (29M) when we first started seeing each other,"
Hey everybody, sorry to use a throwaway. 

In the beginning of dating my bf, I got drunk and lied and made up this story about doing something adrenaline-related. I didn’t actually do this thing, I’m definitely not badass enough. I was aware I was lying when I told this originally, but I guess drunk me just steamrolled ahead 

Fast forward a few months later, I remembered having told the lie. Although unsure if it was even worth confessing to the lie, I told my bf something along the lines of, “Hey… remember that story about [insert story]? Well, I was super drunk. Don’t remember things very well (kinda true in the sense that I was drunk)… This is what actually happened…”.I said all of this in a much more sheepish, less direct manner, but the truth became known regardless 

And proceeded to tell that I didn’t actually do the cool thing in the story. I guess I still feel bad because I didn’t  explicitly say “I lied.” I’m sure he realizes it, even without me saying it explicitly. 

I don’t know really if I should bring it up again and tell him that I was really being a drunk idiot or if I’m obsessing? I’m continuously searching the internet reading on opinions about feeling guilty and lying and I can’t stop going down this stressed path. Like I want to punish my conscious more and keep looking for reassurance from strangers and my bf. Like really all the time I google to find similar situations and stuff to see how others perceive similar situations 

Edit: I do have a history of some OCD tendencies (i.e. as a kid, if I touched something I had to touch if four times) and anxiety. I obsess a lot about my mistakes. I really struggle with self forgiveness 

TLDR; lied about doing something cool to my bf first couple weeks into dating. Feel shitty still, don’t know how to proceed. Thanks so much!"
Anxiety,Anyone else come across this?,Day 6 on meds. I am on 20mg Citalopram and 10mg amitriptyline before bed to help sleep and tension headaches. I know it can take couple of weeks for the side effects to subside after taking them but when i wake up in the middle of the night my my eyes are flickering like mad not my eyes it’s self but it’s like i have watched 100 hours of TV. like i am seeing loads of pictures and after a few secs it goes but if i turn over it starts again and then it goes. Maybe turning over increases my heart rate which triggers it but it goes again. I am guessing all this is just the side effects of the drugs and i need to give it time to settle in.
Anxiety,we’re are animals,"dont y’all ever just think about how advance we humans got, we are animals that develop crazy intelligence. We are the worst kind of species on this planet, there is no god there is nothing but atoms and molecules that had bonded  everything together and to the stars helped create this plane earth, we have no meaning."
Anxiety,"Do you have tips for overcoming that ""numbness"" in your brain/body when being put on the spot?","My group and I have an online presentation tomorrow where we will be taking turns going through our individual slides and as you would probably expect, I am no good at speaking out in a public setting. I don't know if this makes sense but for those who can relate, how do you overcome that overall ""numbness"" in your brain and body resulting from social anxiety? What does everyone on this sub use to manage this social anxiety? I am really eager to improve this aspect of me to get control of my fear of speaking up better but would appreciate some pointers from those who have some helpful tips."
Anxiety,What the F#^%,"This morning I was rudely awakened by my subconscious at 1:24am, no intrusive thoughts, just pure nausea, followed by waves of radiating heat then cold all over my body. I tossed and turned trying to breath through it, but it was a matter of moments before I was out of bed and hugging toilet retching and heaving. Finally when I felt the contents of my body had been fully evacuated, I went to seek solace on my couch, but every time I managed to get comfortable I would shoot up and start to dry heave. 

All of my go to methods to get my mind off of feeling this way seemed to fail me today, emergency meds didn’t work, breathing exercises, powering through and going back to sleep, it all left me high and dry. Now I’m exhausted getting ready to go in to work and I’m already dreading tonight because I know it’s going to be another repeat of what I just went through. 

No idea what I hope to gain from posting this, it’s just about the only I haven’t done to try and work through this. Appreciate you taking the time to read this as well as any tips tricks or advice you might possibly have!

I wish you all a better Monday than I’m currently experiencing."
Anxiety,There is something wrong with me,"I believe I'm struggling with a personality disorder. I feel so lost inside my own head, overwhelming myself with everything at once. It's affecting the people I love the most, my friends and my family don't understand. I don't blame them, I don't understand me either. I'm not a monster or a violent person, I'm scared and I'm worried about the future to the point that I'd rather just end it all. I'm pathetic."
Anxiety,Just needed to talk,"Hey! So I have really bad anxiety, especially in social situations. I had been living in my comfort zone for quite a while and I thought I should step out of it and do something good for myself, but I think I took a little bit too big of a step and now I'm freaking out. Somehow I got into nursing school, I actually didn't get in right away, I got a call almost three weeks into September that there is a spot available if I want to study and I took it. I have so much catching up to do it's crazy and I'm not sure I can do it. We have had all the classes since I joined through computer and it has been oky, I'm still shaking at home when we have to discuss things with group and so on but I have managed that, now we had to actually go to school and I could not do it. It got too much really fast+ the fear of not catching up. I think I will not be able to actually do it, it was great idea but I can't meet these ppl face to face. I'm even afraid to call or write them if I should decide to drop out. I should have let somebody else take the spot. I feel like a complete fuck up. Everybody was so proud of me and now I'm gonna let them and myself down. It’s so bad how anxiety just ruins all the dreams and hopes, I could be doing so much but I’m just forced to hide from life."
Anxiety,Work making me sick,"I recently started a new job because I wanted to better myself for my son’s future. Well as soon as I started, a guy in my department left, and I was given his work. I was not trained properly and I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m panicking every day before work, and the weekends aren’t enjoyable to me because I just think of work on Monday. I am physically and mentally sick over it. I told my boss about my mental health, but I’m worried I’ll get fired. I just can’t continue to do this anymore. I feel like I’m going insane."
Anxiety,fed up with anxiety,"I don't know why but lately my anxiety has gone through the roof. It might be because I'm back at uni and having to deal with in person tutorials again instead of online and be in social situations a lot again for the first time in like, two years but my brain is just constantly critiquing every single thing I say or move I make. I know logically that none of it  is true and it's just this stupid disorder but the constant repeating of 'they don't like you, why did you do that, your so embarrassing' is utterly exhausting and I'm so sick of it

right now I'm literally just sitting here at home texting friends and going through lecture notes but it's unrelenting. I just want one moments peace to just enjoy seeing friends again and being back on campus but it feels impossible.

I know it'll pass but I just hate how abnormal it makes me feel. sending love and positive vibes to anyone going through similar feelings right now 💕"
Anxiety,Couldn’t even go to the gym,"Got up early today to head to the gym because I was tired of working out in my basement, but as soon as I got there and saw all those people walking in I drove off. I couldn’t handle it. I didn’t even attempt to walk in, I’m so embarrassing. My agoraphobia and social anxiety are getting worse. Oh and to top it off I cried in my car and then realized that the person next to me was also still in there car. Double embarrassment."
Anxiety,I've been spiraling because I convinced myself I have mouth cancer,"Tl; Dr : I found a lump in my mouth that I convinced myself was cancer and spent the last 3 days going down google rabbit holes and being unable to sleep because I think I'm going die and leave my fiance to be a single mother. 

I'm new here so I apologize if this out of format or something. Also, this ended up being really long. I can't talk to anyone about this right now so I need this. 

I recently quit smoking. I'd been using it as a coping mechanism for anxiety. I hadn't been smoking for a while but my job has been hard lately and I was smoking more than usual. I've tried quiting in the past but this time I have been more successful so far. I'm going on a month and I've been feeling really good for most part. Ive never been a heavy smoker and have been doing it off and on for 5 years. Right before I quit I felt this small lump on edge of my soft and hard palates. I accidentally popped it when I was inspecting it and it came back about a week later. I popped it again thinking it would just stop but it came back again.

Last week my fiance gets sick with strep and gives it to me. I go to urgent care to get checked out. They tell me my tonsils are swollen and look irritated but that I'm negative for strep. They also test me for mono and covid and I am also negative. They give me antibiotics as they assume that I'm infected just don't have enough levels to be positive on the test or something. my fiance was positive for strep and they so that's likely it. Before I go, I ask about the lump. I had popped it a few days before so it kind of just looked like a small ulcer or something. They take a look and say that it's probably nothing. That so long as it doesn't come back, I should be fine...

I didn't say that this was the second or third time I had to popped it and too afraid to ask what it would mean if it comes back. I go home and put it in the back of my mind as best I could. The strep kicked in a day or so later so I was too distracted to think about the lump. 

By Friday I'm starting to feel a little better and notice the lump has started coming back. I am convinced something is really really wrong and leave it alone so I have something to show a doctor. The thing is white-ish with a little red around it. It's soft, raised dome-shape, about the size of a pin head. It doesn't hurt at all. Just the smallest amount of pain if I suck on it. I'm already convinced it's cancer but I try to look up what else it might be. There are a few benign possibilities that come up but I keep going back to cancer. What really sticks out is that it doesn't hurt at all. I've had ulcers and stuff before and this doesn't feel anything like that.

Friday night I'm laying in bed with my pregnant fiance and I'm fully convinced that I have mouth cancer and that at best I have a few years with her. That I may get to meet our baby but I'll probably die before they can form any memories of me. How I'm going to ruin our wedding. I'm going to throw away all of our money on treatment. I'm spiraling and thinking about how things have been too good lately. I've been waiting for something to happen to offset it like usual, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.  I don't want to tell her yet because I don't want her to worry for no reason. 

Saturday and Sunday I'm home alone while my fiance is at work and on the verge of panic attacks almost the whole time. I'm in the bathroom every 30 minutes   inspecting my mouth for other possible indications that it's cancer. I see a lot. I try to tell myself it's because I've been sick and not that it's spreading but that works about as well as you'd expect.

Sunday, I leave messages for my doctor and dentist asking to get seen asap. Doctor's office scheduling line calls me back and says there's nothing available for about a month but to call  the office back first thing Monday to see if there's a possible time to squeeze in.

This morning I go in the bathroom again and the thing looks like it's basically gone... Like there's still a red spot but the bump is basically gone. I'm relieved but I'm kicking the shit out of myself for freaking out.   I got an appointment for this afternoon and I'm still getting things checked out to be sure it's nothing but I feel so stupid and I'm probably going to waste a couple hundred dollars because I didn't just leave the stupid thing alone when it shows up the first time.

Still waiting on a call back from my dentist office. The voicemail I left probably sounds unhinged."
Anxiety,I’m currently in school,"I’m so anxious. I don’t know why. I talked to a girl in my class for 3min and then she just left me and ignored me to talk to some boy. I don’t know what to do so I’m just pretending to be busy. I have math next and I suck at it so I’m just gonna take a walk around school I think. I wanna forget about school. I just passed next to classmates and strangers. Teenagers intimidate me a lot waw. I don’t know what the point of this text is. I don’t have friends to talk to so I’m writing. Tomorrow I’ll have to see a teacher I’m really scared to see. I’ll write her a message and ask her to read it before she starts the class. 

My heart is beating so fast and I’m really tired and out of breath. I didn’t eat anything so I feel like I’m going to throw up."
Anxiety,Is this just me overthinking?,"Me and a friend goes absolut wasted on saturday, we managed to sneak ourselfs on a hugh yacht which lasted only for about 1 min.

Anxiety,I really hate the state of my country right now,And by my country I mean the US. Idk if I can take living here anymore. I work in healthcare and covid is ruining my anxiety and life. The fact we have people actively prolonging this pandemic makes me feel even shittier. Vaccinated or not I have to treat and have contact with sick people. I just found out i have covid (again) and it’s really bothersome. I’m vaccinated so my symptoms aren’t terrible but I still feel shitty. And even with a positive test because we are so understaffed my superiors still want me to go in and just avoid contact with patients. How is this okay? What is this coming to? I wanna get out of this place.

Anxiety,Tips for overcoming health anxiety?,Does anyone have any good tips to help overcome health anxiety/hypochondria. I think I might have it and do not know how to treat myself without going to a psychologist/psychotherapist. (I do not want to talk to one in person because there is a lockdown in my state and I'd like to remain anonymous about this).
Anxiety,Is my homework ok or am I an idiot? I've already sent it and I'm so nervous :///,"I believe that the most important competence is effectiveness and efficiency.

Anxiety,"DAE feel bugs crawling over and under their skin, even if none are there?",I hate it! It feels like a herd of ants are on my body going up and down!
Anxiety,I need somebody to tell me that I am stupid for feeling like this,"Brief context: I have a bachelor degree in accounting, and I picked a master's degree in business administration. Things work differently where I live compared to the US, but the gist is that you pick a three year degree followed by another two year degree that builds on the first. 

The choice for master degrees I had access to were Auditing and Control, and Business administration. I went with the second one, because it had the added benefit of being taught entirely in english (we're in Italy, so having a degree taught in english is a plus).

Issue is... business administration is significantly easier than auditing and control, and also less specific. Where I study subjects like risk management, corporate strategy, statistical modeling and managerial accounting, auditing students go deep into accounting and I feel like they get a more specific and complete education.

That being said - the choice does not matter in the slightest, because they are both the same degree in terms of 'degree class'. They are just two different curricula of the same master's, as we both graduate with the same legal nomenclature.

This means that, in terms of employability, it makes no difference.  know graduates from my curriculum who went on to work as auditors, and graduates from the auditing curriculum who now work as management consultants. I know it makes no difference - I should not care if it's easier.

And yet I care, so much. It's probably a mixture of ego and imposter syndrome. I'm just dominated by this feeling of regret, sadness and resentment for my choice that never leaves me. It's physical, I can feel it in my stomach and it doesn't let me sleep. I'm not even sure what I am afraid of: I know I will find a job, because literally everyone who graduated from my curriculum had no issue going into consulting, accounting or finance. I am also top of the class currently and have done a lot of extracurricular activities in management positions. I know I will be okay and move on to developing a good career.

And yet I feel terrified. It's a horrible feeling that never leaves me, it has been going on for three months. I have developed some seriously weird compulsing behaviors, such as:

* Constantly checking the brochures of the auditing curriculum and imagining myself being able to write its coursework on my resume instead of the subjects I am studying.
* Constantly checking the employability and salary reports for degrees - which are the exact same, yet I do it multiple times a day in search of some kind of relief. 
* Looking at the notes from other majors trying to figure out if my course is really that simple compared to them in an effort to not feeling like an imposter anymore.

At this point, I don't know what to do. I don't want to bother my friends about this, I can't afford a therapist, and I doubt dropping out of school to then enroll in the auditing curriculum is a good idea. I would be wasting one year doing nothing for a petty reason.

Maybe if you tell me I'm numb I'll snap out of it."
Anxiety,How would you explain what derealization/depersonalization feels like?,[removed]
Anxiety,DO I HAVE SCHIZOPHRENIA?,"The only thing that I have is really complicated to explain but I 'll try. Random thoughts, which I wouldn't qualify as voices but more as loud thoughts in my head pop up. For example, something that doesn't make any sense, it doesn't talk to me, it doesn't command me, it doesn't comment my deeds, or anything like that, they just pop out and they last less than second but after it gets in my head it gets me so scared, my adrenaline starts to pump up and my starts to beat and I get scared of schizophrenia. The second thing is same but it happens when I am falling asleep, when I am falling asleep random conversations,pictures and thoughts pop up in my mind and it freaks me OUT!!!!! For example I will start dreaming about soccer gaming and suddenly in my mind my friend would pop up who would say for example hand me the ball and in that moment, I am gonna open my eyes and my adrenaline will start to rush because I think that it is not normal, it could be so loud but I know its in my head.  
**I know that everything is just in my head.**  
This happens for example 5 days, and it disappears for like month and it comes again for few days, usually when I am tired but it doesn't have any timing, it happens without any warning.  
Doctor prescribed me 0.5 mg daily Xanax for 2 months and he says I am fine and I have nothing to worry about, but I think that I am going nuts, even if everybody told me that people with schizophrenia will never be aware that they are going into it, but I am aware of everything, of every little thing my mind notices or makes. 

I don't think that: somebody is following me, that I am God, that somebody is spying on me, that my family put poison in food, that I have magical powers, I don't see things that others don't, I don't feel things that other don't, I don't have any kind of delusion, that i can read others people mind and etc... literally nothing from these things Only thing that I experience I have mentioned already above..."
Anxiety,Is this a symptom?,"I've been long suspected as having some mild anxiety or OCD. My parents don't want to believe it so I've been waiting to get my own insurance to find out for sure. 

I've always had an issue with sound that makes me feel truly crazy. I'm sensitive to sounds to the point where I'm very jumpy however that doesn't bother me. It's the fact that some sounds seem to penetrate my mind in a way that makes me feel like I can't focus on anything else. 

Sometimes I can wear a watch then randomly boom, all I can hear is that faint “tick” I have to take it off and put it in my bookbag and zip it up. I noticed this doesn't seem to happen to other people and it makes me feel like the guy from tell tale heart which makes me feel bad about it."
Anxiety,Having a lot of anxiety about leaving kitten alone.,"So recently about a month ago I got a kitten! She was a prior outside cat so I don’t really have a for sure answer for how old she is but, I feel like she is at least 3 to 4 months maybe even 5 months old. She’s already went into heat once which makes me think she’s older than what I think she is. 

Anyways my boyfriend’s birthday is on the 9th and he wants me to go hangout with him and go to his house and spend the night but I am so worried to leave her alone. 

I also have another cat named Callie and so far Callie still hisses and growls at her a lot, Callie doesn’t really play with her it seems like she just rather be alone. While I’m gone Callie won’t be able to go in my room to get to her food and water and litter box without being let in by my parents. I do not trust to two alone yet. 

I’m just having so much anxiety that something will happen to hazel when I’m gone. I left her alone in my room for maybe 30 minutes when I was home and she went crazy. She may sleep for awhile but she also has a lot of energy and plays a lot. She tries to climb the blinds and curtains, runs back in forth in the room and up and down the cat tree, jumps to places she shouldn’t be.  Although she will be with my parents they can’t watch her constantly. 

My boyfriend isn’t being really understanding about it all, he doesn’t understand how worried I will be. He thinks that it isn’t really a big deal. I haven’t left hazel alone longer than 2 hours since I’ve gotten her. My boyfriend keeps saying that I could bring her there but they have fleas. I’m not judging for anything because we have had them before but we got rid of them. I don’t want her or my other animals to get fleas if I can prevent that. I also don’t trust her being alone in his room because that’s even more things for her to get into to. I just don’t know what to do, his birthday is important but it’s also my responsibility to take care of her and my other cat. I just really need some advice, thank you."
Anxiety,How do I improve myself when I don't even know if I can actually improve?,"Hi. So I'm not sure if I'm on the right sub but I feel like anxiety is what's causing me to be like this. These days I tend to space out a lot. I also, miss and forget simple things like forgetting to lock the door, forgetting stuff so I have to go back and forth, etc. I just feel like my mind has been constantly clouded these days and I can feel people mocking me for it. Actually, I have two experiences now wherein people told me I seem to lack organization and attention to detail. I used to be able to notice other people's faults/mistakes because I thought I have great attention to detail, but now it seems like I now have *that* problem.

I can't focus when someone is explaining something because I get overwhelmed by its complexity. I noticed I got slower mentally now because if someone instructs me to do something, it would take me a while to comprehend it and carry out the task given. 

I experience more frequent mental blocks these days and it would take me several minutes to express what I really wanted to say. I also notice now I keep getting typos and small mistakes that I seem to miss unless I read it over and over again. 

It's becoming concerning because I am not like this before. I considered myself average or even above average academically; I used to think I was good with directions too because I can follow unfamiliar streets and get to my destination without getting lost. I am capable of learning a new language, watch complicated series or movies, and I was also great with general knowledge. 

But I don't know, I feel like I have less capability now and I feel dumb. I know this sounds like useless ranting but I've really lost all confidence now because all these things keep happening to me. 

I just graduated and I worked for a while but again, I noticed all these things with me which prompted me to quit and now, I'm still unemployed for close a year, partly because I overthink a lot of things and I feel so inadequate to do the job. It has become a hindrance for all the things I want to do and achieve. I want to improve but I don't know how, I feel like these are things I cannot change now. What if this has always what I've been like all along?"
Anxiety,Anybody on a mood stabilizer but not bipolar?,"I’ve been on a mood stabilizer for years along with an SSRI and I’ve never felt bipolar. I’m no longer with the doctor that prescribed the mood stabilizer so I can’t ask. He never said I was BP so that is sort of a clue.   

It seemed to be the last line of treatment for irritability and anger after everything else wasn’t quite helping fully. Also helps with depression. I also think it was because I wasn’t giving the other drugs a chance. I don’t know the exact term but I was trying to bounce between drugs to find the optimal one way too fast. 

I’m just wondering if anybody else has a had a similar situation. I would love to not be BP as all my symptoms fit anxiety disorder **way** better than BP but can be similar. The stigma and life expectancy of BP is also bad which triggers my anxiety. I’ve done some reading about this and did find some similarities to what I’m going through."
Anxiety,Actually works!!,"I’ve had anxiety for years and I’m even on tablets for it. However, nothing seems to calm it other than deep meditation and…. CHAMOMILE TEA!!

Anxiety,Morning Anxiety,"Hello everyone, I’m new here and was recently diagnosed with severe GAD-7. I’ve been having really bad morning anxiety since the past year even more so over the past few months. I wake up because of anxiety and just can go back to sleep. In fact I woke up at least seven times for the duration of my sleep last night. I also get really nauseated and do actually even throw up, whether it be after a meal or just because of feeling too many emotions at once. I do get anxiety cramps as well. I don’t know how to live with this.. everyday just keeps getting worse. It’s like Im trying to find the good days within the bad days.. I don’t know what to do, everything feels the same and nothing at the same time to me. I’ve lost interest in doing the things that I like and love. It doesn’t help that my family is pressuring me for so many things and practically don’t believe in mental illness. I have a boyfriend who is very supportive and is doing everything he can to make me feel better. But it’s a temporary high.. it goes back square one after sometime. I’ve also tried smoking weed to calm myself down which helps till I when it can and yoga as well. I’m currently in the process of finding a therapist so I can get professional help. 

I don’t want to live like this anymore, I’ve contemplated suicide many times. I’ve only actually hurt myself once. The physical manifestations like cramps, migraines, nausea of my anxiety are so painful though. 
Any recommendations or thoughts?"
Anxiety,Does taking Xanax before a presentation help?,"Before presentations I am full of terror and feel like throwing up to the point where I can't move freely bc I feel that if I move, I'll throw up. Then my voice quivers to the point where it sounds like I'm crying and it's hard to understand. I have trouble controlling myself. Will Xanax help? Any repercussions?"
Anxiety,Phone anxiety,Does your phone give you anxiety?... or am I just a freak?
Anxiety,Why am I still so anxious?,The reason for my anxiety (who is a person) has decided to go somewhere else in life but it still doesn’t get rid of the annoyance and mental pain they caused me for some reason. It’s most likely because they’re still gonna be their narcissistic selves and they’re still gonna insult people.
Anxiety,Completion anxiety…need advice,"Hey everyone! Hope I’m doing this correctly because I wanted to ask about a particular type of anxiety. I don’t know how real this is but at this point it feels real enough that it’s affecting my life. 

Over the past few years I’ve increasingly become more and more anxious about completing tasks. Not in regards to procrastination but more not completing tasks. This usually revolves around my hobbies.

For example I’m an avid reader and gamer. I get very overwhelmed when I don’t read enough books or complete enough games in a given time.

I’m also the same when it comes to house chores and at times even work, however it mostly revolves around hobbies. 

It gets to the point where I can’t stop thinking about how much I’ve failed to complete a task, tv show, game or book. T causes me to then not sleep for days on end or even have heart palpitations. 

The other day I had people visit for the weekend and it meant I did not read a book and this caused me not to sleep on Sunday night. 

Does anyone else have this issue? Is this even a type of anxiety? Has anyone got any helpful advice?"
Anxiety,is there no cure besides leaving this place forever?,"i'm extremely anxious and depressed each winter here in chicago. it's just a cold, gray, dead, frozen desert.

i'm better in summer, but like clockwork, each autumn i start getting that old feeling again: impending doom.

i've been in therapy most of my adult life. tried medications. nothing helps. i'm completely dead inside during the winter, and i don't think it's SAD or vitamin D deficiency...i take 5,000 IU each day, and this feeling starts around mid-september.

i just start feeling depressed, low, and hopeless. no energy. no motivation. no reason to go on.

&amp;#x200B;

when i'm in the tropics, i'm a different person. happy, energetic, youthful. i feel young again. i have lots of energy, i'm positive, and i feel full of hope. 

is there no other cure besides moving to the tropics, like hawaii or costa rica maybe? 

my dad was a wise man, and he liked saying: ""running away doesn't help. because no matter where you go, there you are."" 

well, i'm calling bullshit on that one. because i DO feel very different when i'm away from this place.

i just can't describe the inner happiness and peace i feel when it's warm, sunny, and i'm close to the ocean. i feel like i'm going to live forever. it's the total polar opposite of how i feel when i'm here.

has anyone else ever experienced this? has moving helped?"
Anxiety,Last year I was diagnosed with GAD and I haven't address it because I focused too much on my depression side,"Last year I was having racing thoughts and anxiety attacks. It made it hard to go to school or sleep.

This year, it's hard for me to pay attention in class. I get bored easily. I feel like I have to be on my phone 24/7 just to make it through the day.

I also get overwhelmed with suicidal thoughts. They are passive not active. I feel like no one takes me seriously. I would wish this in my worst enemy. The thoughts weigh me down. I think they also make me excited? It's a complex feeling.

Later this week, hopefully I will finally address my anxiety with my new therapist. 

I'm also experiencing apathy and anhedonia. My old hobbies don't make me happy. I'm unmotivated to do things if I have something to do later in the morning or afternoon. It's strange. My friend who has ADHD says that's a symptom.

Go figure.

I can't even read stories, or long article for class. Forget watching TV, Netflix or Movies.

I'm so bored.

Any suggestions?"
Anxiety,Does anyone else usually forget about their periods of anxiety? As if it got wiped from your brain,"It took me years to articulate my feelings because once my anxiety passed, I couldn’t really remember how I was feeling and what I was thinking abut exactly. I’d remember the general details of what caused it and that’s about it. My bodily response never seems as severe in retrospect. It’s like my brain deletes those memories for until I get unreasonably anxious again."
Anxiety,Im a 37 year old father of 3 who recently discovered by the help of my psychologist that my anxiety is thru the roof.,"Hi guys. My first real post on reddit. Soo yeah sinve my psychologist made me realise im anxious (never took the time to realise that) my life has become soo much chaotic since now i realise what anxiety do to me. I thought it was something related to my adhd and tought nothing more of it. Now i cant focus on my job properly.  I binge bite my nails. And i try to calm myslef but its hard.

Please if you have any tricks you use to try and focus and to relax i would really appreciate it.

Sorry i think im having a panic attack and breathing technique are not working."
Anxiety,Wearing a mask at my new job,"So I’m fully vaccinated &amp; I got a new job recently inside a grocery store. I haven’t started yet but when I went in for the interview almost no one was wearing a mask. I was pretty much the only one wearing one. So now I’m getting anxiety and thinking well I’ll be the only one wearing a mask &amp; no one else is. And then I’m like well I don’t wanna get sick somehow still or get anyone around me sick. 

But I’ve made the decision that I’m going to wear my mask though. But it’s the just the anxiety of people looking at me and judging me or something by being the only one wearing a mask. Ugh. 

How do I shake this anxiety off"
Anxiety,Can someone help me understand?,"I don’t feel like what I’m dealing with is normal, I know it’s anxiety but it seems like so much worse than that. I get really stressed out very easily, I overthink all the time. It’s especially related to relationships I find, I just get to such a horrible point of worrying, like I get panic attacks over the smallest things, I constantly double check with them as to wether a joke I made was offensive which just removes the whole charm.

I just feel like there’s something I’m not aware of in my life, my mum helped me with anxiety and adhd, but that’s only because she had them, if she doesn’t have any other disorders, how else am I supposed to figure out what I’m dealing with?

So that’s why I’m here, It seems like it’s related to anxiety but I don’t know if it’s just a high level of anxiety or something entirely different."
Anxiety,Got officially diagnosed with Anxiety a few weeks ago and now I'm kind of scared to see the psychiatrist.,"My mom took me to the doctor a few weeks ago because I was having a few problems and I thought I was about to die. My heart would be racing for practically no reason and I felt almost sort of weak but not really, so of course my brain was thinking ""ok we're dying"". After asking my mother to take me to the hospital many times she finally gave in and didn't take me to the hospital but a private doctor. When we got there they checked everything and said I was fine. There must of been something wrong because the doctor then asked for my mom and I said ""okay just tell me I have three days left to live"" in a sort of joking manner and the doctor started asking me about my home life and how I'm doing. I didn't even tell her much and already she knew something was wrong. After a small process of trying to have a conversation while sweating in a room with ac and constantly fidgeting the doctor then called in my mom and explained what's going on. Then after she said what I wanted to say to my mom my bum ass had an anxiety attack. I kept trying to leave cause I didn't want them seeing me cry or judging me for doing this for almost no reason but then after I calmed down no less than 2 minutes later I had another one but it wasn't as bad. 

After that process the doctor set up an appointment for me this Thursday to visit a psychiatrist for Anxiety disorder and now I'm scared. What should I do?"
Anxiety,Advice on my medication if possible?,"I’m on Celexa 20mg to help with my stress and anxiety and i am also on amitripyln 10mg at night to help with my sleep and tension headaches i get. How long till side effects subside after taking them, 2 weeks roughly i am guessing?"
Anxiety,I think I need to stop being such a perfectionist,"I'm in university now, I graduated HS two years ago. I worked full time one of those years and covid, mental illness, and the wrong major fucked the second. 

Anyways I'm doing good now. My classes are more manageable. But I get 68% on a test I thought I got an A on and it sends me into a spiral. I need to remind myself that even if I got straight 90s in highschool this is different, and I should be happy as long as I'm passing. But I can't help feeling the urge to just...give up if I don't get almost perfect. I need to be more gentle on myself. I go between everything in my life is falling apart and I'm too depressed to care to 'oh no I got a C! This is the worst day of my life!'"
Anxiety,COVID vaccine anxiety - feel I made wrong decision,"I finally got my first COVID vaccine yesterday after overcoming a big anxiety about it, but I feel so stupid and annoyed with myself. I could have got Moderna but instead I got Pfizer because I thought it might be safer. Now I realise I was being stupid and obviously should have got Moderna as Covid will cause more problems than a vaccine. All recent data shows Moderna is a lot more effective against delta and I KNEW that but still got Pfizer out of fears I had about Moderna due to it having more mRNA and from reading a lot of antivax stuff. I just feel so annoyed that I went and got the vaccine finally but didn't actually get the ""best"" one even though unlike most people I actually had a choice. I feel so foolish.

Now I feel like I will still get COVID badly despite being vaccinated. And I have to wait 8 weeks to get my second dose and I am so depressed about not being able to go out and live my life. I let anxiety rule my decisions and I can't believe I let anxiety make me overlook that Moderna was obviously the better choice. Also because Moderna gives more protection from the first dose as well compared to Pfizer.

I hate that I'm feeling so anxious and down about this. I felt so proud of myself yesterday for getting the vaccine finally and now I just feel like I made the wrong decision by not getting the one that will give me most protection. I'm so so down and I don't know how to get out of this black hole. Maybe it's the immune response making me feel more depressed than usual, normally it's just bad anxiety I deal with. Of course I'm grateful I got any vaccine but I just hate how I let anxiety rule my decision and go for short term alleviation of my anxiety (by getting Pfizer which I, for some reason, felt was ""safer"") rather than getting the more logical option of Moderna which is proven to be more effective both short and long term.

I don't know if my anxiety about the vaccine has just now got transferred to Covid. I was anxious about COVID before but i was focused on deciding about the vaccine so that distracted me. Now I read stories about so many breakthrough Pfizer cases, even celebrities like Hilary Duff, and I feel so hopeless and stupid. I don't think I could cope if I got really sick with COVID. If I had no choice between Pfizer and moderna that would be one thing, but I did!

 I'd been putting off taking antidepressants for my anxiety but this depression and hopelessness I'm feeling now makes me feel there's no choice. Getting the vaccine should have been my ticket out of anxiety, not this. I hate this feeling :(

Can someone help me get some perspective on this as I'm really struggling."
Anxiety,Does anyone get panic attacks out of a no where at night?,I’ve started to feel super anxious and night and when I fall asleep I’ll wake up in the middle of the night to a panic attack.

Anxiety,Fear of panic attack while flying,"Dear all, please help a girl out!
I (30F) have never been afraid of flying. Not that I was too happy about it, but I used to fly for work and personal matters many times, alone, without any problems.

But I also never had anxiety attacks before. They started in late 2019, and although now I am much better, I have a great fear of having an anxiety attack on a fight. I can't stand that feeling when I can't control my body and thoughts, feel like I can't breathe, sweating, dry mouth or going to faint. It is awful and I am not sure what I'd do if it happened on a flight.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Any tips?"

Anxiety,"Very very uncomfortability, sometimes anxiety or reflux after brushing teeth","Do anyone have something like this ? I read it could be because of mint so i changed my paste to not minty , so it is less severe but still very uncomfable after brushing. Like i have this shit for the past maybe 7 years. I am sitting just fine chilling, and then after brushing i cant do anything i like, enjoyeating etc. It really fucked my life especially in these 2 months. I was exercising taking cold showers everything, my life improved and then bam, just this one shitty thing fucked it all. And what frustrates me most i dont have a solution for this. I cant just not brush my teeth. But brushinf it makes me insane. Well it is better to brush without toothpaste or just with baking soda but still makes my teeth feel weird after. Why is that ? I literally were overthinked every solution to this, and have got to literal dead end. I wish it was only psichological, but i dont know it. I was just having everything so good untill this shit came up. 
Is it normal to feel weird and very uncomfortable after brushing teeth ? Like you feel your teeths and it is so annoying and discomforting. You want to just chill and eat and after brushing you cant enjoy it because of it. Why ?  And sometimes get a reflux ( and i think it is psychological now that i dont brush with minty toothpaste) . What can i do ? It literally makes me unproductive and cant enjoy things.
It just freaks me out. Like it is 50% psychological and other 50% physiological so i dont know what to do. 
I cant just give up brushing like i gave up other things. I am just stuck. And cant focus on other productive things. Any tips please"
Anxiety,anxiety and depression has made me a more negative and delusional person than I thought,"I feel like I take myself way too seriously and have become so aggressively analytical and bitter towards everything. 

I’ve always been chasing an escape or an easy way but now I realize what’s most important. I’m 19 and I’m still figuring out how everything works. But here’s 2 things.
1. I’m realizing relationships are the most important.
2. I just want to find something I love doing with other people that feel the same. 

Idealistic shit does not matter and stop being so hard on yourself. In the end what truly makes you happy will prevail."

Anxiety,"I stopped reaching out to unsupportive ""friends"" - but I feel lonely. What should I do?","This year has been very heavy for me. I had to deal with grief over the loss of a dear friend. Then I realized that my ex was a narcissist and I went no contact with him, while many mutual friends kept adoring him. I also suffer from generalized anxiety and health anxiety, so I often have to cancel on friends or I go through periods where I am too anxious to go out or plan anything. I also realized that many ""friends"" are either unsupportive of my struggle with anxiety or they don't reach out at all, despite me always reaching out to check how they are doing. I proceeded to gradually distance myself from said ""friends"", but now I feel extremely lonely and isolated. I find it difficult to form new friendships due to my anxiety (I don't feel like I can make any plans with new people because I know I'll disappoint them by either canceling, rescheduling, or being off when I see them). So I can't rely on my old friends anymore, and I find it difficult to find new ones. Anyone in the same situation? Any words of wisdom?"
Anxiety,Morning Anxiety,"Every morning I wake up with anxiety.

Anxiety,Has your anxiety gotten worse because of social media?,Just curious to see social media and anxiety correlate. Feel free to share your experience.
Anxiety,I just realized that I've spent most of my life worrying and don't know what to do,"so I've been worrying a lot recently and have just come to the realization that I've basically spent all my life worrying. 

all my life I have always wanted things to be permanent. things fading away into nothingness scared me so much. for instance I would always buy a fountain pen instead of a normal ballpoint pen because the former seemed more permanent to me as you can refill it when the ink runs low. 

if I start a hobby I want it to be something that I can always do and there should be nothing that prevents me from doing it. I used to be into speedcubing but then I started thinking "" what if they stop the production of Rubik's cubes and I won't be able to buy them"" I know it sounds silly but at that time it made me very anxious and I spent every waking moment googling about it. but in the end, I had to give up because it was not worth the amount of time I spent worrying about it.

and this continued for a couple of years, I would pick up something then ill start worrying about it, and then I ill give up. 

about 6 months ago I had severe health anxiety but the anxiety was not from the fear of dying but from the fear of not being able to do things I loved. somehow I finally got over that and took up reading books. in my mind reading was something that I thought was something I can't lose. but it all came crashing down when I found something that was a little hard (a double negative sentence) for me to understand so I googled similar sentences in the hopes of understanding them better and quicker but that lead me to question every sentence I read, sentences that were fine before are now a nightmare. now every time I read a sentence I stop to think about what it means and I have to visualize the sentence otherwise I can't move on. visualizing a sentence might sound easy but when you throw in a couple of negatives it becomes a nightmare. 

this has been going on for about two months and I am certain that I've spent at least 70% of the last two months worrying about this and repeating sentences in my mind until it made sense. on top of that, I get anxious that I might have dyslexia even though I can read and write really well. this is when I finally realized that I have to put a  stop to it because I just can't give reading up, if I did id have nothing.

if you read through all that I thank you and would really appreciate any advice that you might have for me."
Anxiety,Is shaking normal when waking up after an attack and other questions.,"Im new to this I've only had 3-4 attacks but im not diagnosed but im pretty sure i have some form of anxiety, anyway I had an attack last night because I keep convinced myself that I have schizophrenia, which is also not diagnosed, I woke up in the morning and started trembling for like an hour, I've told both my parents they keep saying it's just the computer and screens messing with me, I doubt that but can anyone help?"
Anxiety,Suffering too much lately,"Hey, I have been spiraling down my anxiety abyss lately and it hurts. I’m constantly in worry about non sensical things. I have no control over the spiral anymore. 
Lately my girlfriend has been kinda withdrawn for a couple days and we are in a ldr. My anxiety is making it a lot harder for me because it just needs something to latch on to and this time I am worried about my relationship because I love her. 
I have been experiencing physical symptoms lately too which didn’t happen. I feel a deep pit in the stomach and my limbs feel weird. My heart throbs really fast too. 
I really want to get back to my life when I didn’t have anxiety, because life sucks right now and it’s been very hard. I have to make a lot of effort to get myself up on time, feed myself and drag myself to class and job. It takes more strength to always appear normal while there are times where I’m clearly not okay and feeling the physical symptoms. I can’t even talk to my friends about it because I don’t feel comfortable sharing all this. 
I do not know what to do."
Anxiety,I feel like something bad is going to happen to me?,"I haven't left my room in months (only to shower etc), but I rarely go downstairs. I have had 2 ecgs and a check up from my doctor and everything is fine, but I always feel like today is my last day. It's like I'm waiting for something to happen - something bad.

Has anyone been in this position and how did they cure it?"
Anxiety,can someone help me understand severe anxiety?,"when i was younger, my interpretation of mental illness was that when we experience it, we can get ourselves out of it. basically, we are in control, not the illness. i even practiced it. if i felt anxious, i could calm myself down. but then a few months ago, i start getting panic attacks out of no where. then it progressively gets worse and goes into depersonalization/derealization. then to insomnia. so what gives? i’m still trying everything i can when it comes to my thoughts and redirecting them. but can anxiety be a chemical imbalance? can it not be in my control?"
Anxiety,Why do i feel like im not here,"Every once in a while i feel like im not really here and go numb, stop caring about almost everything and keep zoning out. But i dont know what to do because i cant just wait for it to end because last time i zoned out for about 30-40 minutes while in school and it feels like something is pulling me away and forcing me to zone out if that makes any sense"
Anxiety,Life changed in less than a year,"Hi, I’m 20. Had anxiety and depression for most of my life. And ADHD. My anxiety spiked this year in July where i had my first panic attack. I got baker acted because i could not calm down after having two more. Got diagnosed with GAD and put on lexapro for 6 weeks. Got taken off because it made me numb and emotionless for the entirety of it. I am now stopping Effexor because it makes me suicidal, dead inside, depersonalize and not myself. Now i have brain fog, question everything that happens and I’m depressed and even more anxious. 

Can i be fixed? I start therapy in November 1 but life has been rough. Don’t even know what’s real anymore. Any support would be great…"
Anxiety,Don't wanna do anything antmore,"#MAYBE TRIGGER# 

I'm just so tired, I'm 23 now, i have wanna off my selv since i was i child. But i hold on, i couldn't stop believing i would be better someday. Everybody said.  But now, now I'm just afraid if anything, afraid I'm not good enough, afraid to speak. I didn't know what i could hold on to anymore, I'm losing my friend, i don't have a family and I'm so afraid to be alone"
Anxiety,I need help dealing with my partners anxiety,"So my partner has developed quite hard social and health anxiety. He's constantly worried that any small itch or sensation means he must be terminally ill. That's usually followed by X doctors appointments and special procedures which end up with nothing. These are getting quite expensive too.

On the other part he has social anxiety to a point where he can't pick me up from work which is 10 walking minutes away. I also have to accompany him to all appointments, but that's also partly due to language barrier (he doesn't speak the official language yet and English is often hard with older people).

I'm getting to the end of my wisdom, I'm burnt out of ideas and how to help. I started working full time, am the only income we have and he needs rewards to push himself to do tasks constantly which includes buying things. I'm really clueless. So I'm asking you people with health and social anxiety: what do you wish for from your partners? What's yours dos and don'ts?

Thanks in advance for your help!!!

PS: Therapy is hoped for in about half a year to a year, spaces are scarse and we need to wait for multiple appointments to get access to free therapy (covered by insurance). So we're on that, but there's still time to get through."
Anxiety,Struggling,"Hey everyone, I know I post in here what seems like everyday but I am struggling today. My anxiety stems from my eye sight and when I get anxious, I know it makes it worse. I started seeing eye floaters about two years ago now. It was super hard to get past but I eventually trained my brain to forget them unless I looked for them. Fast forward, I went through a super stressful time and all of a sudden I they came back and I couldn’t ignore them anymore and now they seem 10,000 times worse than they did. I also experience sensitivity to light (no headaches thankfully) and sometimes blurry vision but I think that comes from looking at my phone. I also feel like I can’t focus on things like I could before? But not in the sense that it’s blurry, but things don’t look the same? I’m just trying to see if anyone else here struggles with the same issues? :("
Anxiety,Need some advice =),"I'm struggling to cope in class doing art in college but filled in a classroom full of 6 other girls and and they all get on with each other, they're all really good friends with each other, but I'm not good friends with them. I'm there full time from 9am to 4pm.

They all compliment each others work and it makes me anxious about my own. There is one girl who is very crticial on my art and she goes ' wtf is that, that's awful '

I get a gut feeling they might not like me. They talk in public more than me, but nobody bothers. I try to get talking but it just doesn't work 

I tried to be smiley while I can't really initiate a conversation I struggled to do that and I'm the only lonely one out of all the table 

I do this course full-time with them and I'm here until the end of July next year and I don't know how long I'm going to cope it's painfully boring and I sit there for about 9 hours a day"
Anxiety,I finally saw a psychiatrist and now I feel like shit,"I just had an appointment with a psychiatrist because of anxiety and suicidal ideation and it was a one time thing so there’s no seeing her again and I was so nervous for the appointment that I completely forgot everything I’ve been feeling and everything she asked me I just gave her the most basic answers a few of which were completely untrue and I forgot to mention most of the things that have been bothering me. I feel so fucking stupid, this was my one chance to actually get real help and I completely blew it. All she said was basically that I’m right in thinking that I have anxiety and to just keep doing what I’m doing. 

For the longest time one of the only things that kept me going was the knowledge that I wasn’t trying my best to get better and that if I really wanted to I could be helped. Now I’ve done everything and I still feel as bad as ever if not worse. I just feel so stupid and I don’t know what to do now"
Anxiety,"Splashed a ton of mouthwash in my eye, having a lot of anxiety","I did my best to rinse it out by cupping water in my hand and blinking it but I feel that wasn’t enough. I then decided to take a shower after like 15 minutes to wash it out better. It wasn’t hurting that much in the shower so I thought everything was fine but I’m trying to sleep and my eye burns so much. I’m so scared it caused permanent damage :((

The mouthwash is Listerine nightly reset (sodium fluoride &amp; acidulated phosphate topical solution: Water, Sorbitol, Propylene Glycol, Xylitol, Poloxamer 407, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Benzoate, Phosphoric Acid, Eucalyptol, Flavor, Methyl Salicylate, Thymol, Sodium Saccharin, Menthol, Sucralose, Disodium Phosphate, Red 40, Blue 1"
Anxiety,I physically can’t handle listening to other peoples problems sometimes lately,In the last month or so there have been multiple occasions where stressful of heavy topics absolutely throw me for a whirl. Sometimes for days after I’ll be anxious. In the moment there’s a chance I’ll get nauseous and start to completely space out and panic just from hearing someone vent. Sometimes it gets to the point where I nearly pass out. This started when I started feeling stressed about the idea of potentially moving out (I didn’t end up doing it) and it has happened here and there ever since for the last month.
Anxiety,Eye anxiety/ anxiety in general,"I’m posting this in hopes to just get opinions from anyone who has experienced this. I’m currently having visions problems which include sensitivity to light, eye floaters, seeing things move in the corner of my eye, tracers behind moving objects, can’t see at night, double vision at night, patterns are hard to look at, eyes take a while to focus after shifting vision to another object, after images last entirely too long, and random flashes of light when trying to sleep. As you can see it’s alot and I’m starting to think it’s stuck like this it’s been a little over two months. All make me dizzy and make me think I’m going crazy went to an optometrist to get eyes checked and they said it was fine. Don’t really trust that opinion as it is seeming to get worse. Feel like I’m dying slowly. Scared to sleep because I think I won’t wake up been to the ER at least 7-8 times all tests came back okay. All comments are appreciated I am slowly giving up hope that I’ll get out of this."
Anxiety,how to stop thinking im going to die?,"im 15y my first panic attack (?) was 4 months ago, i was normally on my notebook and felt my arms heavy, i ran to the living room and was crying afraid of dying, because i felt i was going to faint and i didnt feel my arms, it was it for 2/3 hours, then until this day i get anxiety stuff but mainly now its because when i eat i feel sleepy, and i get scared of passing out or dying while sleeping, what if the blood will not go to my brain anymore? now the anxiety is getting afraid of passing out

 never passed out in my whole life and it looks so scary, what if i pass out and wake up on a hospital with something serious?? or i dont wake up?? what if its something serious and the help will take a long time to came and i die?? and i feel like disassociating too

today i have to go to school and i cant get calm, i have PE today, what if i have a heart attack and die? is my heart okay i never went to the doctor to see it, this mystery is awful, i want to cry again, i know its anxiety i know when i get worried i get worse but the thought of passing out or dying is so bad, i cant stand up because what if i pass out

 i remember of the history of teenagers having a heart attack and dying and i feel like im next

the only way to stop my anxiety is going to the doctor but i cant without my mom and she doesnt care at all and say its all on my head, but how do i stop it them? how to convince me im not gonna die even the silliest it looks like? say some statistics of the reasons people of that age would die? and the chances?????"
Anxiety,Slack…Feels bad man.,"I work in IT, and I pretty much have Slack setup with push notifications 24/7. At any moment, I could receive a ping letting me know that everything at work is on fire. This has caused me so much anxiety over the last 3 years, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to even get out bed in the morning. Although most messages are pretty harmless, every time my screen lights up my heart skips a beat and I say “Oh no” in my head. This level of anxiety has been ruling my life for a long while now, but I’m taking steps to try to feel more in control. I’ve heavily decreased my caffeine consumption, I’ve increased the dose of my anxiety medication, and I’ve been continuing to go to CBT to learn coping mechanisms. Not sure why I decided to write this today, but I figured I’d put it out there…It already feels better having let it out."
Anxiety,Was this medicine or just nerves,I’m scared to take medicine. But my anxiety is eating me alive. Got prescribed Xanax to take for 2 weeks to get me functional enough to leave my house and get on a long term pill. I am scared to take any medicine though that’s why this has gotten this bad. I take half the Xanax. Twenty minutes later I feel stiff and start shaking uncontrollably and can barely breath. I’ve taken Xanax before for anxiety. Was this feeling it “breaking through” or what? Never felt this before.  I’m still wound up. But even through out it all I never necessarily flipped out like I normally do.
Anxiety,how to overcome anxiety? starting a self defense class again,"i'm 15 years old and tonight i'll be starting a krav maga class. i used to take it with my older brother and his friend when i was 9, but we all stopped when i was around 12. we used to take the children's class, where there were like 4-5 other kids besides us. it was fun and i got good exercise, really wish i hadn't quit looking back on it. now i'm 15, and starting the adult class. my dad also took this class a couple years ago but he stopped around the same time as me, my brother, and his friend did. first of all i'm nervous that the instructor will be mad at me because i quit. when i took the children's class he acted nice, but he was still strict for the most part. my dad said he was very serious and strict when he wasn't around kids though, so i'm worried that he might feel resentful towards me. my dad said when he did the class there was another teenager, which i'm also not too psyched about since i'll probably be super awkward. i wish i could start the class with my brother or his friend but they're in college now so that's not a possibility. also i'm really insecure about my height and how skinny i am, (5'5, 120 pounds) and how people might think of me. also, the class starts late at 9:45 and ends at 10:45. i usually like to go to bed much earlier. the thought of going gives me a lump in my throat and i feel nauseous, but i've already committed by telling my dad i'd do it. whenever i know i'll be in a social situation i always feel nauseous, is there any way to make this feeling go away? i appreciate any advice, thank you"
Anxiety,"My voice gets very high-pitched when I'm even a little nervous or I've just been nervous for a while, how do I change this?","It's like that lump in my throat makes my voice catch, it's horrible, very uncomfortable and it makes me look ridiculous in class or I can't speak when I want to, or to someone, someone knows if I can do something not to Does it happen, or does it happen to you too?"

Anxiety,I think my anxiety stems from undiagnosed ADHD,"Does anyone else feel this way? I’ve had anxiety pretty much my whole life, and it wasn’t until relatively recently I started to realize it seems to be caused by doing tasks. Simple things such as doing the dishes seem extremely daunting, and I’ve always been extremely forgetful and unorganized. I was able to skate by in school without studying and putting in minimal effort because I’m a good test taker and bullshitter. Im in my last semester of college now and I just have hit a wall, I feel like I can’t do anything and I’m already so far behind. 

Im constantly thinking about school, finding a job, and some drug issues currently going on in my family that have made all my issues worse recently. But no matter how much I think I can’t bring myself to do practically anything and I’ve been having non stop panic attacks. I just want to be a normal person who can do basic tasks without freaking out or being extremely stressed about it, I want to be able to read and actually retain information, I want to be able to feel like I’m in control of my life, because right now I feel like my symptoms are controlling me. I’ve felt this way my whole life but it’s reaching a point where I just don’t know what to do and need help

I’m seeing a specialist soon about these issues, but in the meantime can anyone relate? I just want to know I’m not the only one struggling like this"
Anxiety,I’ve been so anxious for a while,"Can anxiety manifest itself physically? Because I’ve been having really bad anxiety and I also feel pressure in my chest like my heart is growing too much or something, I’m you g and I recently went to the doctor for a checkup and they didn’t find anything weird but Im just so worried about…ironic I guess"
Anxiety,Just need to get this off my mind,"Parenting - the greatest and toughest thing I've ever done.  I love every minute of it - even the not so fun parts.  What I don't like about it is the anxiety that it has brought to my life.  Prior to being a dad I can't think of anything I every worried about.  Now, all I think about is letting the kids down.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I'm writing this - whether it's to get it off my chest, to seek some form of validation, or to just be told it'll be okay.  Either way - before kids I never thought much about my own mortality.  I knew my time was borrowed and I just wanted to enjoy as much of it as I could.  But recently they found something on my one lung (my dr said she's never seen it turn out to be anything but scar tissue and to not worry) and all I can think about is letting my kids down by not being there.  I know dying is something we all do and when your number is up, it's up.  But, I'm petrified of my son being angry with me, or disappointment in me for not being there.  Is this something all parents experience with their own health?  Or am I just crazy?  Why can I not just trust what my dr told me?  I shouldn't have ever googled it, huh?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways - I think I just needed somewhere to post my thoughts.  My wife always tells me to not worry until there's something to worry about.  Sometimes, my mind just takes over though!!"
Anxiety,i sang to my boyfriend for the first time this morning,"the past month my bf has been asking me to sing to him and ive always said no because of the anxiety it gives me [i cant even like go out in public without having severe anxiety]

this morning i said fuck it, why not? and i sang to him for the first time and he loved it :))) idk now that i’ve done it + seeing him so happy makes me want to sing to him all the time"
Anxiety,You are not weak. You are a badass!,"Life is tough. Life when your brain is actively trying to sabotage your every action can feel impossible. I’ve suffered from anxiety for 16 years, but the last ~7 months have been the worst of it. Many times I didn’t think I would make it. I can’t count the number of times I thought “there’s no point in going on if this is what I’m going to feel like all the time.” But I’m still here, and so are you. 

So often we think our anxiety makes us weak, but we don’t take into account the amount of strength we need just to get through each day. I’m finally starting to feel normal again. I have streaks of good and streaks of bad, but I’m feeling better more often than I feel bad. It gets better. You are strong. You are amazing. I’m rooting for you.

This is the mantra that helps get me through each day and reminds me how strong I am to still be here: “You wake up each morning to fight the same demons that left you so tired the night before. And that, my love, is bravery.”"
Anxiety,weird post but I’m curious: Any other women here want o be pregnant so bad so that they can forget about their current issues and anxieties and hav someone else to think about and worry about thats not yourself.,The title kind of explains everything
Anxiety,So I feel like I do something wrong,I don't know what's up but sometimes I just feel like I've done something wrong like all the time and everyone hates me all of a sudden I have other people talk to me and it feels fine but wrong again I don't really know how to explain it sorry
Anxiety,"If my anxiety will be with me forever, is it really worth it to continue fighting?","I don’t really have the energy anymore to type a lot. I have OCD. I’ve tried many things with varying success, yet I’m just starting to realize that this will never actually go away despite my wishes, and so the fantasy I have in my head of one day being calm and joyful is inconceivable. If that’s the case, is it really worth to continue fighting? I guess I’m just looking for a reason not to completely give up. I just want to call it quits with trying to find a solution. At this point, I’d sacrifice everything, money, success, fame, and it all, just to be at peace."
Anxiety,Anxious,"Does anyone else have a friend that sometimes is the root of the anxiety? Like, one of my best friends just sometimes says things or does things that don’t affect me really but still makes me anxious. For example, he sometimes hangs out with someone that I dislike and I think is a bad person. Obviously its out of my control but it still makes me anxious. Not talking to him anymore would probably get rid of that anxiety but he’s my friend? I don’t want to lose him."
Anxiety,Constant anxiety with panic attacks,Ive (36m)suffered for years with constant anxiety and severe panic attacks. Have been on medication about 15 years to help with depression and anxiety. Just recently thought about my days and daily routines and Ive discovered that I masturbate multiple times a day (3 4 sometimes 6) to deal with stress and anxiety. If I stop for a couple days I can tell a big difference in my stress and anxiety level. Has anyone else discovered this or have this same feeling or experience?
Anxiety,Wonderful sleep...... NOT!!!!! feeling super anxious gotta try and get through come on you got this!!,"Slept terribly v v anxious upon waking and then for over an hour after couldn't get back to sleep.

Well try not to!"
Anxiety,I answered a professor's question and he praised my answer in front of the whole class!,"I've usually never had a problem with social interaction, especially in classroom environments, but my anxiety's been really bad lately. The semester's just started for me and although I've generally stayed quiet in my computer networks class -- which has been widely regarded as one of the most difficult computer science and engineering classes at my university -- I powered through my anxiety and answered a professor's question in class last Thursday!

We were talking about how data was transmitted through electricity and he asked what the problem was with transmitting binary data as electrical high states and electrical low states, and it took me a bit of time before I got the courage to raise my hand with what I was thinking. Humor my nerd talk for just a moment, but I proposed that merely using electrical highs and lows as 1s and 0s would be useless for deciphering data unless a time interval were defined for a single bit, or else we wouldn't be able to tell where a bit started and ended.

I was completely shaking by the end of my response but the professor praised it in front of the whole class as an excellent response that showed a lot of critical thinking! My hands were shaking for the rest of lecture from the rush but I did it: I responded in class even though I was afraid. I miss my teenage years before my anxiety got so bad and that was the norm, but hey -- I did something!

Oh and for the record, there were multiple correct responses. The specific one that the professor covered was both my response and one that nobody had thought of: using high voltage and low voltage as 1 and 0 would inadvertently induce an electrical current over time, so we actually use high voltage and *negative* voltage. I know that this is a bunch of nerd talk so thanks for coming to my TED talk."
Anxiety,FVJCJFJFVKVKVK thsssssn!!!!,"Worryingggg worrying worrying worrying!!!!! Everything makes me panic, I'm so tiredddd!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
Anxiety,I am having a panic attack. God save me.,"TW: su!cide, murder. Pls don't read if you're depressed. 21F. I was in so much pain for the last few days. I was angry with God and everything. I wanted to die. The other day I was driving with my parents and I am just learning to drive. I took off my hands from the steering for a moment. And then I put it back. I'm scared. I wanted to die but does that count as attempt to murder?
I can't honestly remember my intention. I have started driving less anxious because I am not scared of dying anymore. Before I used to be very very anxious. I am still learning to drive. Plus I have suicidal thoughts and urges. I had the urge yesterday and I removed one hand. My dad saw and laughed and told me to put both hands. Had he not told me, I would've crashed. Only thing is I didnt even think about this entire incident for the whole of yyesterday.I randomly remembered it today and now I am really freaking out. I first got anxious cuz I thought that homicide and suicide was my intention and I was sure of it. Now one hour later, i am not really sure what my intention was. Maybe i was just trying to be cool? Maybe I got confident? Idk. What should I do. Oh another thing is that I had no practice in driving. I hadn't driven in 2years either. I had never driven in the dark. But the other day I felt daring and indulging in risky behavior and so I asked if I could drive my friends car. I was really bad at it and I kept screaming but I did it anyway cuz I wasnt scared to die because I was depressed. My friends were scared of my screaming and driving. I almost drove on into the fields cuz I couldnt see in the dark. I drove on the wrong side of the road cuz I have bad road sense. Does this count?"
Anxiety,Thankfully I’m not freaking out but something silly happened while I’m high...,"So... I smoked some more after smoking a bit earlier and I feel good... except one thing. Sigh. You know those fold up chairs used for camping with the mesh seating or whatever? I don’t know if I accidentally didn’t unfold it all the way (the ones that you pull out to unfold) and I was sitting in it for maybe 20 minutes and one of the leg’s support screws stripped and broke? Sigh. I think a replacement screw from a hardware store might fix as the leg rests in a fastener or whatever (don’t know how to explain) and a leg isn’t say welded to another... I don’t think? Sorry just trying to be descriptive.

I think the leg is good and I get it’s completely accidental but I’m kind of embarrassed. 😕 It’s not even my chair it’s either my roommates or my brothers... worried brother might get mad, yell?

I checked the other screw and it seemed rusty. Maybe it was going to fall apart eventually after being out in the rain? I dunno?

Things were going well until this sorry."
Anxiety,Is this anxiety/stress?,"Yesterday i went for a walk but it felt weird my head felt really woozy and light headed when i looked left and right i just didn’t feel right. My stomach felt off too maybe contributing but as it got closer to the end of the day i felt really off my head felt like it was all over stomach felt more off and it made me cancel rest of my plans that day. These last 5 weeks have been very stressful for me and i suffer with health anxiety which doesn’t help. When you have high levels of stress/anxiety can you feel like that? when i got home and tried to relax, eventually i felt very fatigued and tired but i also ate which might of helped things. I did have something before the walk so didn’t think it was the hunger or dehydration. When i closed my eyes too it felt my head was going 100 miles an hour and when it was quiet felt like a loud whooshing in my ears.  Eventually it all calmed down i believe but daily i do feel those symptoms daily but dry mildly. I do believe it’s anxiety sad stress but everyone associates fast heart beat with that and i don’t get that really only when i am really panicking."
Anxiety,I can’t stop rubbing my tongue on the back of my teeth.,I have tried to just stop or replace it with doing something else. I have tried to keep it on the roof and bottom of my mouth.

Anxiety,Advice on anxiety/stress.,"I am from the UK, what are the best supplements out there for anxiety/stress i want something to calm me and destress me. I am looking to do CBT but not fancying going on antidepressants again. There’s so much stuff out there and have no idea what to try and if it’s safe to take long term and what not. Or is it all a theory and CBT and antidepressants are prob the go too with meditation and breathing techniques and stuff like that?."
Anxiety,Anxiety about being rehired,"So, I had two anxiety attacks when I was working as cook at a certain restaurant and only lasted a day after 11 hours of feeling drained, alas I quit, but I’m gonna get rehired because the money is good for a day job and I’m having a lot of nervousness hoping I won’t mess anything up or quit again because I’m really trying to break out of my shell since this is my very first job as 25 yr old.

And then I put it back. I'm scared. I wanted to die but does that count as attempt to murder?
I can't honestly remember my intention. I have started driving less anxious because I am not scared of dying anymore. Before I used to be very very anxious. I am still learning to drive. Plus I have suicidal thoughts and urges. I had the urge yesterday and I removed one hand. My dad saw and laughed and told me to put both hands. Had he not told me, I would've crashed. Only thing is I didnt even think about this entire incident for the whole of yyesterday.I randomly remembered it today and now I am really freaking out. I first got anxious cuz I thought that homicide and suicide was my intention and I was sure of it. Now one hour later, i am not really sure what my intention was. Maybe i was just trying to be cool? Maybe I got confident? Idk. What should I do. Oh another thing is that I had no practice in driving. I hadn't driven in 2years either. I had never driven in the dark. But the other day I felt daring and indulging in risky behavior and so I asked if I could drive my friends car. I was really bad at it and I kept screaming but I did it anyway cuz I wasnt scared to die because I was depressed. My friends were scared of my screaming and driving. I almost drove on into the fields cuz I couldnt see in the dark. I drove on the wrong side of the road cuz I have bad road sense. Does this count?"
Anxiety,healing,"I don't know if I really have anxiety since I don't have enough money to go to a doctor but I am having a hard to breathe, feels like my chest is getting tight, my head also gets tight whenever I try to do something new, try to be happy, try to achieve something , and  try to work hard for something. I think it's because of the failures that I had in the past. Sometimes, my head hurts all day. My head is full of thoughts and I can't control it.

Lately, im trying to process every thoughts that I have and I feel like im getiing better compare to before but there are days that I really don't. :(( i just want to ask, for those people who is now free from anxiety

how long did it take before u can say that u are finally healed or better?"
Anxiety,Having a very hard time,It’s 4am and I woke up to use the bathroom and my heart instantly started racing. I couldn’t calm down and kept checking my pulse. It shot up even more. This has been going on for the past 4 days and I’m so tired of it. My anxiety is making me lose my mind and I feel like I have some type of illness. My breathing is as if I just ran around the block. How can I calm my heart rate down? I just want to be able to sleep and feel normal. This is horrible
Anxiety,Anxiety reduces quality of life so much,"First off, I never had panic attacks and I know there are people who have it way worse than me. But I have anxiety about each and every small thing that comes up in my life that I barely ever feel confident or have the strength to stay sane every single day. I can control it in the moment sometimes but the physical symptoms like stomach turning and having shivers are too much to handle. Even the times that I CAN control it, all my effort goes into calming myself down that I have no energy left to do anything else, even to enjoy watching or playing something. Also, the fear doesn't ever go away completely, it always stays in the back of my mind. The only time I feel relief is when the small thing I'm worried about has passed, but that lasts only for a few days or sometimes even just a few hours since I get a new thing to be worried about, that's just how life is. This really affects my self esteem since most of the time I end up feeling like I'm a weak person. Where do normal people find the strength to face problems? And is this what I'm going to feel like for the rest of my life? When will I start to wake up feeling safe, secure, confident and sure of myself consistently? It seems like a fantasy."
Anxiety,"Ok so whenever I use the bathroom, I always end up washing my hands for longer than needed, I can't fkn control it, I don't feel clean until like after 5 mins of straight up washing my hands, but then I end up getting severe anxiety from the fact I'm wasting water and increasing the water bill","And I'm a teen who lives with his parents btw, I just get severe anxiety from the above mentioned issue, what do I do?"
Anxiety,"Can clinical Generalized Anxiety Disorder cause long, nonrestorative sleep (11+ hours)?","It's no mystery that Generalized Anxiety Disorder can cause trouble falling and staying asleep, as well as feeling tired all the time.

Can GAD in particular cause long, nonrestorative nighttime sleep of 11+ hours and long daytime naps of 1.5+ hours over the course of many years? Nonrestorative means it feels like you never slept upon waking, thereby causing extreme daytime fatigue and exhaustion.

(In the absence of vitamin deficiencies, anemia issues, thyroid issues, sleep disorders, etc.).

I can't find any studies on this. Normally people associate GAD with insomnia, but I'm particularly curious about the length and restorative aspect in those that can fall asleep just fine."
Anxiety,humanity is disgusting.,"honestly all that bullshit about being a nice person blah blah be kind spread love are genuinely all lies. 

i realised how people just do things for their own benefit. maybe to inflate their ego knowing they did something good today. 

nobody cares unless it’s about themselves. 

rarely do we find people that care about anyone honestly. 

that’s the sad truth i just learnt."
Anxiety,Heart fears. Can't get out of cardiac awareness states.,"Mid 30s male, healthy, no family history of heart disease, active, no underlying health issues.  It started leading up to my covid vaccine, I was so stressed and nervous about heart inflammation.  After the shots, I found myself constantly fixated on any feelings in my chest, for fear of developing something.  Obviously, my anxiety gave me the symptoms I was looking for.  Chest tightness, palpitations or extra beats, dull or stabby pains across the chest, heavy heart beats, erratic heart rate.   So I went in to the doc.  They ran some tests, ecg, echocardiogram, Holter monitor.  Everything normal.  I also had a heart workup ab a year ago when I went to the er with a panic attack.  All normal. Anywho, doctor said it was probably anxiety and I was okay to resume exercise and what not.  But I am still having palps and little pains that come and go(which I am trying to decipher are muscular).  I just want to relax and stop worrying about it, but can't.   

I am not seeking medical advise, but maybe just some reassurance.  With the collection of tests I had, I am most likely just fine right?  There would have at the very least been some abnormality if I had heart problems i think.  Does anyone else throw extra beats and get chest pains throughout the day when your having heightened anxiety?"
Anxiety,A dream I had made me extremely anxious,"I get really bad anxiety when I think of someone specific. In my dream I was able to see every single picture of them that I had ever kept before I deleted them, it was so clear. I almost wanted to throw up when I woke up. I’m not sure how to handle the anxiety I get when I think of this person."
Anxiety,hypochondria sucks,"Today i went to a party and didnt eat or drink before. When i got there everyone was drinking and smoking weed (which i tend to stay away from). I did smoke a couple cigarettes though and it was all good until the migraine hit, usually i get a small headache but this one is unusually bad. So i google the symptoms (tension, red eyes, raised heart rate) thinking nothing bad of it, and lo and behold it says i should seek medical help asap. Why the FUCK did i have to read that, why must i always go against my morals and google stuff. It almost feels like a twisted comedy movie sometimes the way this shit works."
Anxiety,I wish I had more confidence,Like the title says I really wish I had more confidence. Everytime I text someone I get this apprehension and second guess myself. Just tonight I messaged my gf a compliment and I immediately back tracked and I didn't want it to sound creepy and its just so mind numbing fucked up. She's the sweetest person and loves it when I compliment her yet I still think she'll think im creepy. Im so fucking over this repetitive BULL SHIT!
Anxiety,Feeling hopeless,I just feel so fed up. I finished CBT and got told to make an appointment with the doctor. I just had it and they basically said they can't do anything and I should have learnt how to deal with my anxiety in CBT. Well I didn't and I'm really struggling and I just feel like what's the point in trying to get better if nothing works and no one is helping me.
Anxiety,Medications?,"Would be really interested to hear some experiences with anxiolytics. Successes? Failures? Any you’re able to take regularly to keep the baseline anxiety down, or is it mainly PRN medication? Would really like to find one I can take regularly that won’t just knock me out like PRNs (e.g., diazepam, olanzapine wafers). Thanks, hope you’re all doing well!"
Anxiety,Anxiety has crippled my life completely,"My anxiety has crippled me somehow, i dont really know but my mind hasn't worked the same since i got anxiety... Well a bit of context: right at the start of july, it was about 10pm and i was vibin with my friends, just chilling, nothing too exciting or different. But suddenly my mind goes blank and i feel like my head has been filled with air. I immediately freak out and go tell my mom, i never felt anything like that and i felt i was going to just fade out of existence. My mom calmed me down eventually, but it took alot of time (until about midnight). The next days were terrible, i went to school feeling like my days were counted, and my mind simply wasnt working properly for some reason, it felt like i had somehow lost control over part of my brain. In the same week (it was monday when i had the first experience) my mom said that it was probably anxiety. I didnt know what anxiety was or felt like then, I've never had felt anything like that before, it couldn't be that terrible right? Well, the next week proved me wrong. When i woke up on monday, it felt the same as the past days, slow, grey and boring, but when the night fell, i began to feel a strange sensation, like i was going to die no matter how much i fought, and with that came many other symptoms which i can only describe as being like something or someone was pulling on my consciousness string. It costed me to fall asleep, and the following days were horrible, panic attacks every night, day time was just me scared of having another panic attack, sitting on my couch waiting for it... Then, on the weekend, i was finally convinced i had anxiety, i didnt know how to feel about it, since i was more concerned about me dying. For some reason, i have not had any panic attacks since then, but the next weeks following that event were full of doctors and medical exams. I went to a neurologist, there i explained my experience with what we thought was anxiety, and he only confirmed it, but he told me that i should do a tomography of my brain just in case. I did it and it came back all normal, absolutely nothing out of ordinary, and it kinda helped calm me down a little. Also, since the first experience, i have felt anxious all the time, i have not been able to have a single day where i can say "" man, today was a good day and i won against anxiety"". The neurologist also gave me a prescription to 25mg of sertralin, and i believe that was the reason i stopped having panic attacks... Well to finish it off i would like to apologize if this has gotten too long or confusing but its currently 6 am and i just woke up felling anxious again😕


Ps: forgot to mention but im 16y with no record of anxiety prior to the events mentioned in the text"
Anxiety,Please can I have advice I don’t feel like I’m where I physically am and it’s so confusing,A week ago I had a lovely weekend with my best friends that felt like a holiday (it was just at their house) but I assumed that feeling as though i was abroad was because it was a mini getaway and their family isn’t British so slight culture differences. A week on and every instinct tells me I’m not at home. I’m half Brazilian and every smell and sound reminds me of Brazil and it’s as though the only bit of me that isn’t there is what I can see. Whilst I like this feeling it’s also unsettling the longer it goes on and doesn’t stop. My anxiety is spiking more easily now and I don’t know what to do.
Anxiety,Any remote job/ career ideas?,"Hey! 

I’m looking for remote-career ideas!
Backstory: I’m 28 and have a degree with I don’t use at the moment. Being introverted and having ADD I just can’t concentrate with people around me. This is the major factor that has lead me to not continue to pursue the career that I majored in, the stress is simply to much for me to do a good job. 

Now my main goal is to find a job that I can do remotely. And I could very well go back to school for a year or so If that would lead to a job that I could do from home.

I like creative stuff and fitness! Any ideas?"
Anxiety,want to move on from my job,"
i work in fast food and I’m pretty sure we get paid the min. wage in my part of illinois which is about $11. The pay wasn’t necessarily an issue I’m just annoyed at the amount of stress and anxiety I feel like I’m enduring and I feel guilty for even feeling this way. 

Don’t get me wrong the management is fine my coworkers are fine but I just don’t know what it is..I just feel constant guilt and the feeling of me being a bother to everyone else and I know it’s in my head but idk what to do. 

kinda off topic but I mentioned me being a college student because my schedule this week has been insane. Luckily I talked to a manager and they were understanding enough to fix it .

And that’s the thing. Like I said the management is fine but what if at my next job I’m not so lucky…the job I’ve been looking into is more of a grocery store with better pay and supposedly flexible schedule too. It’s similar to instacart where I would kinda be working by myself which I also like. Idk what to do ughhh
And I know that I would need to let my current managers know as soon as possible, two weeks notice etc"
Anxiety,Support,I just need to know that the feeling i’m feeling will eventually end and I will have my normal self back. because I can’t deal with this anymore.
Anxiety,I tried watching a movie I’m scared of,"And when I calmed myself down and it was the calm parts, I still felt numbness, paresthesia feelings and muscle twitches (Fasciculations). All around my body even when it was a calm scene. Is that normal? Why did it go off then?"
Anxiety,Physical Symptoms - can anyone relate?,"Hey all

Quick background - after staying indoors for the most part of the year during covid, me and my girlfriend finally made the move to Indonesia and have been living in bali for the past 3 months.

Ever since we arrived I have felt anxiety creeping in (I haven't suffered with this for around 5 years, where I had bad consistent health anxiety / panic attacks that spanned over a year) 

Going out to restaurants / shopping seems to trigger it.

But it doesn't quite feel like before - I'm convinced I have a serious illness and have done the usual googling, convinced I have a parasite / covid etc. etc. (this is very unlike me, i'n never usually concerned by illness)


I feel symptoms of fatigue / body ache / brain fog / stomach issues - made worse by going outside, I feel considerably better when I'm at home chilling and doing my thing which makes me think It's anxiety related - I also had a great day playing golf with my friends a week ago, and my symptoms all magically disappeared while i was being active and concentrating on the game.

Sorry for the long post - but can anyone relate to this situation?"
Anxiety,How do I break it to my boss that I'm not trying room with him,I have terrible anxiety and just kind of agree to everything.   My boss wanted me to rent a room in his house.  At first I thought it would save me a lot of money but now I don't want to do it.  I'm too nervous to say I don't want to now cause he pretty much expecting me to move in and help with the house.  What should I do?
Anxiety,My girlfriend has anxiety,"We have been together for 4 months, due to my experience w my past partners who had anxiety I thought i was gona do well w my current partner. But I really overestimated the situation and start to comprehend her situation. Idk if i was being stupid or dumb that I recently know she has almost anxiety or panic attacks every single second. How do i go about it? I really love her for who she is. This is something ive not faced before."
Anxiety,Anxiety symptom?,Past 2 weeks my right arm feels really heavy and weak. There’s no pain or soreness just feels kinda dead in a way but can still do stuff. Maybe my muscles just feel really fatigued or weak from my anxiety and stress. Il say again there’s no soreness and aches feels normal that way just the way it feels. Is this just anxiety? I just wish it would go that feeling. Tbh last 5 weeks have been very stressful and i have been very anxious.
Anxiety,Personal trigger,"Hearing people talk about death really makes me feel weird. I feel like I don’t have much time left for no reason and it scares me. 

Any advice on how to overcome this?"
Anxiety,Career Change Anxiety,"I've spent the last four years transitioning careers to be a full time teacher.  I'm happy to be teaching and I can assess and see that I'm having an impact, which is why I chose it.  However, I'm also an incredibly anxious person since I was diagnosed at 11 (38 now).  What I'm struggling with are intrusive thoughts that exhibit themselves in the evening as vocal outbursts and wringing hands.  I'm a highly sensitive person, and what I think about is mostly misbehaving students.  I'm doing my best to deal with them in ways that will be productive and it's only been two weeks in school.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying my best to give myself grace, but I'm naturally harder on myself than in any way that I could get from others.  Still, what I'm struggling with our intrusive anxious thoughts.  What's strange to people who don't have anxiety, is that many of us get anxious about the anxiety itself, which is messed up.  That the anxiety is already there is bad enough, but that another part of my brain/amygdala/physiology is WORRIED about the WORRY, only adds more wood to the fire.

This is a 3 day weekend for me and I'm trying to be vigilant in my relaxation (how oxymoronic is that?).  I'm also up at 6am on Reddit talking about my anxiety....so I guess it'll take time...."
Anxiety,(Trigger Warning) It's so hard to stop constantly checking the news and news subreddits.,"I don't know why I keep doing it. Every time I go on /r/worldnews I keep seeing a bunch of depressing and scary stuff. 

I'm also a catastrophic thinker, so I'm always thinking of the worst possible outcomes for everything. I'm probably going to go see a therapist about this stuff because it's really driving my anxiety and depression up the wall.

I'm constantly thinking about stuff like the collapse of the US, Global warming, war with China etc. 
 
Sorry, my thoughts are all scrambled around. I just wanted to post about this somewhere."
Anxiety,Anxiety and music,"If possible, I will always play Pinegrove on shuffle if I feel a panic attack coming. Weird how it (almost) always works. Just tossing a friendly band out there, they are a great band to jam to if you ever feel a bit overwhelmed. 

Share similar bands in the comments?"
Anxiety,Whyyyyyyyy,I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t afford therapy or medication. I don’t know what to do. I hate anxiety so much with a passion. My legs right now are tingling. My heart is racing. It’s 5:30am. I literally made this account because I posted too much anxiety posts on Reddit with my other account and I’m scared if people would be annoyed by me.  Like why am I anxious 24/7. 😡 please someone give me some motivation or support. 😔 does it ever get better.
Anxiety,Anxiety symptom?,"Past 2 weeks my right arm feels really heavy like slight pressure and weakness mainly top of my arm near my tricep/shoulder. There’s no pain or soreness just feels kinda dead in a way but can still do stuff. Maybe my muscles just feel really fatigued or weak from my anxiety and stress. Il say again there’s no soreness and aches feels normal that way,  just the way it feels. Is this just anxiety? I just wish it would go that feeling. Tbh last 5 weeks have been very stressful and i have been very anxious."
Anxiety,Does anyone have writing anxiety?,"And if so, how do you deal with him? 

I’ve found that if I have to write anything important, be it applications, an essay, or a major work email, I often seize up and don’t know how to proceed. It might not even necessarily be difficult, and I might know deep down what I want to say, but I usually feel this crushing sensation and can’t put my thoughts into words. Sometimes I physically can’t write and get a mini-panic attack. It’s not an issue with language, since I have no problem writing on Reddit or texting friends, nor do I have dyslexia or learning disabilities."
Anxiety,"Things that make me on the verge of an anxiety attack, are any of them familiar?","Hello! I am not officially diagnosed because psychiatry and therapy are unavailable to me at the moment, but I find a lot of the anxiety related exercises help me in my day to day life. 

I wanted to share some of the weird things I find myself anxious about to see if anyone has a similar experience.

1- leaving the house twice in the same day. 

2- having ""too much"" fun, like enjoying a video game a lot for example or binging a good show. 

3- doing things without the approval of an ""adult"", I'm 23, I still see myself as irresponsible/ unwise. I mention my plans casually in front of someone who is an ""adult"" to see if they think it's a good idea. Kind of like asking for permission indirectly. 

4- my friends making mistakes/doing bad things. I understand it's out of the scope of my responsibility, but when I learn that a friend got themselves into trouble I feel as if I'm the one in trouble, this immensely affects my daily life as I find myself acting like it's the end of the world, while my life is actually unaffected. 

5- going to places for the first time. 

6- feeling like people are intentionally leaving me out/ withholding information from me. If something is happening and I'm unaware of it, then I find out about it later, I feel like I'm about to throw up/pass out. The information is usually not that big of a deal. 

If you'd like to let me know about your experience with any of these or even something else please do!"
Anxiety,Anxious living website?,"Hi everyone, I've had an idea to start up a blog to give people who are living with anxiety basic guidance on everyday living. Just to give people a place to read how you do ""normal"" things, such as looking for a job, going to a restaurant or going to a dentist appointment. 

Personally I have to run through scenerios in my head and going somewhere or doing something I know nothing about it terrifying.

Do you think this may help anyone?"
Anxiety,I feel hopless,"Hey i been having terrible anxiety a while back i could barley sleep, i keep looking things up im scared of having a serious illness, this kinda came out of no where i been having palpitations,twitching,tremors. When i go to sleep i feel like im shaking even tho im not. Toes and fingers been feeling numb and i feel like it’s getting worse and worse. My muscles will get stiff and ill have pin and needles everywhere. Every once in a while I’ll feel normal where nothing shows up but very short lived usually and all my test results always come back good. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I was on a short trip and i felt pretty good until i flew back home and it all started over again"
Anxiety,Having a bad couple weeks,"Hey yall. I just need to rant i think

Around this time last year, i had super bad anxiety for a few weeks. Woke up every morning super nauseous, couldn’t sleep well, etc so i went on lexapro. It was horrible for me so i quit after a couple days. After those few weeks, my anxiety went back to normal. 

The past 2 ish weeks its been back pretty bad again - i have a lot of stressors in my life (got a new job, quit it, got another new job, starting 4th year of uni, just dealt w a bed bug infestation, dog died, cat has an unknown skin condition, u get the jist) and i cant seem to shake it. Even smoking weed makes me super anxious. I havemt been eating the healthiest lately either bc im so busy and my body feels like shit. Any tips on how to get through this?"
Anxiety,"I am in a big mess rn, because of college and moving","I just kinda need to cry it out, so if you are here for advice or stories about someone getting better, I suggest you stop reading. Just a lil' disclaimer.

I am starting in college in 20 days. Which gives me big anxiety by itself...but at the same time I have to move to the town where my college is, because otherwise I would have to commute about 2 hours every morning and then evening...plus I need to find some job to do, after school, because my family is a bit poor (only a bit, we're ok, but they cannot afford to pay my rent) and this combination is just killing me. 

I have big anxiety attacks, depression is kicking in, I don't have the money to go the therapy, I've already used up the program from my health insurance company, where they give you 10 free sittings and it's been useless, because I couldn't open up and tell them about my suicidal thoughts, how big my anxiety attacks sometimes get and that I think I have some small hallucinations (I compare it to prisoner zero from doctor who. I know there's something behind me, I sometimes notice something in the corner of my eye, but I can't catch it fully).

My mom (a psychologist herself. People say she's good) can't accept the fact that there is something really wrong. She knows about my sucidal thoughts and tendencies and she tries to make me happy, but she's not helping me to find therapy and I'm unable to do so myself. 

I actually kicked myself into sending an e-mail to one bigger company, that runs intervention therapy centres across our republic, asking them if there's any way to try and get some therapy somewhere or atleast with some discount, but it's been a month and still no answer and I'm just getting worse (have been for the past 3 years).

I just can't take this shit anymore...everybody always says ""lots of people go through this"", or ""you will get better"" and shit, but for fuck sake, how's that supposed to help?! I just need someone to help me and find some therapy, maybe that will help. 

I am actually starting to feel physically ill, tired, I have a rash and a stye...that hasn't happened in a long time and I am so sick of it...

&amp;#x200B;

If you read this far, thank you for your time and I just wish you the best, stay safe, even if I leave you all."
Anxiety,Is this a panic attack??,"Hello everyone 
I've had GAD for about 2 years now and manage it pretty well with the help of my psychologist. The past month ive been experiencing these weird feelings which I'm  not sure are related to anxiety or actual medical problem...

I will be feeling completely fine not doing anything in particular then start to feel a little uneasy, I'll get a sudden rush or wave of warmth all over my body, my HR goes fast and i feel very anxious and scared during and after it happens.. 

 Has anyone expereinced this? Is it like a anxiety attack or panic attack?? Or a medical issue..."

Anxiety,medicine,"i have started taking mexaron and as i feel , from starting phase my anxiety gets worse"
Anxiety,I have a phobia of seeing a fictional character in real life after reading about real life sightings of fictional characters and in one of these cases a fictional character killed a bunch of people,"This started after I read something in Fate Magazine and Fortean times of fictional characters being sighted in real life. In the former case, four people were killed by an entity that resembled the character Cecil from Beany and Cecil while they were spearfishing on a raft, and the story came from the sole survivor who had witnessed everything. He was disturbed for the rest of his life because of what he saw and he suffered mental breakdowns afterward which only ended after the show finished airing, 3 months later. The latter case (the one mentioned in Fortean Times in 2016) didn't involve the character murdering anyone, but it involved a woman who had seen Slenderman approach her in a misty field. He started to stretch out his arms and start spinning while moving towards her. She ran, and her dog was scared also. Then she turned back and he had vanished, too quickly for it to have been a person. She didn't even know what Slenderman was until her daughter told her. Both of these cases involve the sighting happening at sundown and when there was fog or mist in the air.

Ever since, I've had this fear of fictional characters appearing in my room as I sleep and doing things to me, and a fear of walking alone at night. Or being with my friends, then suddenly there's a mist and a fictional character appears and kills all of them except me, then nobody believes me."
Anxiety,Anyone feel a weird buzzing sensation in chest/neck when falling asleep?,"Over the last year or so I have often felt a weird buzzing/vibrating feeling in chest and sometime neck and tongue when trying to fall asleep. It is not heart flutters/palpitations, it feels different.

I am on vortioxetine so i'm unsure if it's to do with that or anxiety. I have been on the vortioxetine for 2 years and only had the buzzing for about a year, so I would lean towards it not being the drug. I have also been on other SSRIs for over 20 years and never experienced this before."
Anxiety,"Finished my first two days of college courses, most anxious I’ve been in ages","It’s really unfortunate because it feels like the first year of high school all over again. All of the uncertainty, this time coupled with the fact that I’m far from home and don’t have the luxury of a hug from my parents, which I won’t lie, is what I want more than anything. Maybe that’s immature but I feel like it’s all I have to rely on.

I’m starting a very rigorous engineering program. It kicked into gear instantly and threw me off-guard. My high school experience was not a cakewalk— I struggled in classes hard and came out on top of them, so I remember what this feeling is like. But I also had many failures, and it feels worse now when college is your future on the line. 

I keep waking up with that pit in my stomach. I hate feeling scared, I hate lying in bed and inventing catastrophic scenarios in my head. I hate not *knowing*. I don’t know how to succeed in college. I‘ve never done it before. I don’t know how much time studying is too little and how much is too much.

I hate crying about it. I hate anxiety."
Anxiety,Unusual headache,"Iv had a headache ever since I went to sleep last night and it’s an odd on, makes my brain feel numb I guess or something. It didn’t hurt at album it dosn’t exactly feel pleasant. It’s just this very faint pressure in the front of my head that makes me feel light headed and this tingling in the back of my head that… tingels. Idk what to do about it or what kind of head ache it is. Any suggestions?"
Anxiety,Anxiety related memory loss,"So I’m really struggling lately with increased levels of anxiety and am experiencing extreme memory loss which I think is related. Like I can’t remember things I did the same day, the day before, year ago, and nothing beyond that except faint blurbs. It’s really upsetting and scary and I wanted to know if anyone feels the same."
Anxiety,My life in almost every area feels like in shambles. What can I do to get better?,"I have posted this on r/depression but felt I should post it here too get some better perspective or just get a feeling that I'm being heard.

 I am 31/M. Blessed with both anxiety and depression and on meds currently. Therapy didn't help much.

* I'm a burned-out freelance writer, wanting to quit this career and get into programming.
* Health-wise (Physical and mental) not doing too well.
* Have a very few friends and feel lonely even when I'm with them.
* Never been intimate or been in a relationship.
* And don't know who am I anymore.

I really feel life would feel better if I get in a relationship because I am yearning for romantic love and affection. But it is impossible (or very difficult) considering the place where I stay, covid restrictions, and I absolutely have zero female friends (It's a surprise that I have male friends in the first place.). I'm not from a Western country so dating isn't a common thing in my town. It's more common in metro cities but I can't move there right now.

Fellow people of this sub, can you offer me any help to become better? While other things will take time, receiving love and affection would definitely change things.

P.S.: Also, if you have read this far, thank you so much and I could really use a hug right now and shed a couple of tears."
Anxiety,Looking for some encouragement,"I'm going to try to keep a very long story short.

I have pure OCD and suffer from bouts of major depression accompanied with huge anxiety levels.

After a hell of a couple of years I had a bout of major depression last May. The anxiety was unbearable. I was put on meds that helped just enough to keep my head from underwater. The rest has been me trying with all my might to beat this monster one mf step at a time. As I was starting to get significantly better, I got covid. That put me back on square one.

I ever so slowly started to build myself up again from that deep hole.

As I was starting to get better again, I developed a weird neurological symptom from covid. Back to square maybe 3.

After some negotiating with my stupid mind, I managed to keep my fear about the neurological symptom more or less under control, then I gave it all I have to keep moving towards the light.

Finally, after a total of four months, for the last couple of weeks I have been almost in tears with relief every single day. Each day I would find something else that was 'back' (a deep sense of joy from playing with my daughter, for example - my creativity, for example - my focus, my energy levels, etc.). I cannot accurately describe the sheer happiness it gave me to be given the opportunity to live and love again.

BUT

A couple of days ago, I noticed my heartbeat was a bit too fast. I checked and it was 135. I rushed to the doctor, they run some tests, all clear. But my pulse continues to be waaaay up there. It will take a long time for the cardiologist to see me, and I am left with this unnerving fast heart beat and THE LEAST capable mind out there to handle the situation.

I just want to cry, but I can't. I don't think I'll be able not to be affected by this. I am not ready to go back to the living hell my life is when fear is in charge. I desperately want to stop the shitshow that I know is about to commence (anxiety feeds the symptom that feeds anxiety) but the odds are all against me. There is no way my defective mind will win this battle.

I want to share what I did today with you guys. I was super-anxious about all this, but I had a test to take. So I took it. Then I got home and lied down, ready for a meditation session. I was feeling anxious before starting but the minute I lied down, oh boy, shit absolutely hit the fan. The most overwhelming physical sensations started rushing through my body. The heart beat was POUNDING in my ears. The hands felt like they were on fire, I WAS fear, just unbearable. And I... I just let it happen?

I just stayed there with nothing but these feelings and sensations for almost an hour. 

A few interesting things happened, if anyone is curious.

But right now I just need some encouragement from someone who can relate. That's all. 

Thank you all. You're all amazing, and stronger than you think."
Anxiety,Isolation,"Has anyone else kinda isolated themselves from family, not because you don’t love them, but because you’re just anxious to have conversations? My parents and I have a great relationship but I don’t visit nearly as much as I’m able to and sometimes I won’t text back for hours because I’m thinking about what my response should be / if it’s good"
Anxiety,"Fear of airplanes, but not when I’m actually in them","As the title suggests, for as long as I can remember I’ve been scared of airplanes. Not when inside of them, but when I hear them. 

I get terrified every time I’m alone and hear an airplane passing overhead (usually when I’m in my house and can’t see it). My mind thinks “it’s going to bomb you, it’s going to crash, you’re going to die” and I literally prepare for death every time. I get so terrified I sit there frozen in fear until the airplane passes.

I don’t know what caused me to feel this way? All I can think of is 9/11 but I started off having no fear at all of airplanes passing overhead and it gradually grew worse until now I feel like it’s an actual problem. 

When I’m with family or friends, I might get a twinge of fear but nothing too extreme; and if I can see the airplane, same deal. I could just look out the window to try and see it but usually I’m too scared to do so while it’s passing."
Anxiety,Hate my brain,"I feel like my whole life is just myself fighting against my brain, and fighting against the problems my brain actually creates"
Anxiety,Does anyone have any tips on how to not be so anxious at school??,Basically I’m really quiet in class and hate it but it’s like I just get so many thoughts in class and overthink and then don’t say anything and I  hardly speak to people. Like I do have a couple of classes when I’m more relaxed for some reason but then I just end up stressing in them about the rest of my day. And I do have friends who are really good but it’s just it’s my last year in secondary school and I just don’t wanna be the quiet kid anymore cuz i just feel like no one knows me.
Anxiety,Nervous About My New Medication,"My psychiatrist just put me on Gabapentin, and I'm a little nervous. I've been on the medication before and it helped me a lot, so much so, I eventually didn't need it anymore. But my anxiety has  skyrocketed since then, so my psychiatrist wants to put me back on it... but... A family member of mine recently OD'd on a combination of street valium and Gabapentin. So, my family is NOT at all thrilled about my new medication.

I don't know I'm just really nervous."
Anxiety,Nausea that started randomly and persisted constantly from then on??? Any help would be deeply appreciated,"A few days ago, I suddenly got a strange set of symptoms. I got a cold sensation in my hands, I got a strange tingling/butterfly feeling in my chest that then slowly spread down into my belly area after a few minutes. This butterfly feeling that spread to my stomach would then develop into what would be considered as nausea; it became into pain and discomfort. This nausea/belly ache persisted for like 3 days. It was constant, it never left for the while 3 days. It was always there for 72 hours. I also developed a lack of appetite. A burrito that i easily could have finished weeks ago was now giving me trouble on the 5th bite.  

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound anxiety or stress related? Has anyone suffered nausea with a similar pattern (sudden onset and then being constant for days)?"
Anxiety,Idk,"I’m not the kinda person to talk about my feelings. but ive had generalized anxiety disorder diagnosed since I was 8-10 I don’t really remember. Lately it’s become so extreme I can hardly sleep because I’m consumed by thoughts of home invasions my gf or family members dying and me not being there nuclear warfare. Whatever extreme unlikely scenario that could happen. I went to the doctors today to get a prescription for something to help with this and they prescribed me Zoloft which I previously took in high school and didn’t really feel any different. I guess what I’m asking is if anyone knows a prescription that I could ask my doctor about, I’m not really concerned with the depression side of things I just want the irrational thoughts to be gone"
Anxiety,"Want to be alone, but I feel lonely instead","I'm not someone who has a lot of friends, but some days I enjoy being alone so much (or find it so much easier than socializing and hanging out) that I feel like giving up all friendships. I would much rather spend my weekends all by myself than interact with someone.

If it helps, I have always felt like I never really fit in or belonged where I currently live. I want to move, and I feel that I'll be able to start fresh in a new country and really find people I vibe with. However, at the same time the thought of ""what of I never vibe with anyone"" always lingers.

Does anyone know what this is, and what the root cause of this could be? I'm 24, focussed on my career, and have a great family support system but I completely lack a personal life."
Anxiety,Anxiety &amp; opticians,"I need to go to the opticians again soon for a check up. My sight has been sucky for a few years and the idea of it worsening, or being told it’s worsened makes my anxiety considerably worse. I haven’t been in years because the run up to the appointment is just crippling for me, and I always end up sobbing in their office. I don’t get like this over anything else (like I’m fine with dentists, doctors etc.) Can anyone help?"
Anxiety,Constantly Anxious,"My anxiety has been really bad this week. Even going to the kitchen in my house makes me so nervous. I can’t see anyone until Tuesday and I’m getting impatient. My whole day feels like torture, I know I’m the only one who can calm myself down but it’s so hard sometimes. i feel like im going crazy. i also can’t bring myself to ask for help, anytime someone asks if I’m ok, I ignore them. it’s almost like I’m embarrassed? it’s not until they leave I want to ask for help, but in the end I know I’ll never ask them. I always act like I’m happy and ok in front of everyone, so maybe thats my fault. I haven’t gone outside this entire week really, maybe only in the front of my house. I was supposed to go grocery shopping today, but I don’t think I will. I know it’s bad to avoid, but i just don’t feel like dealing with it today. hope I get better"
Anxiety,I can’t read books anymore…,"Anyone else encounter this? I used to read *all the time* when I was younger, and I genuinely love reading. When I was about 17 I stopped being able to focus well enough to read, now I get too anxious and it becomes impossible to make it through a few pages without getting all panicky feeling. I’ve managed to read a single book in the last decade, and it was a special format novella that had 100 chapters of 100 words each. Lately I’ve been really wanting to re-read Harry Potter, as I read the books in my teens and am obsessed with the films and the overall lore and have sort of begun forgetting details from the books. I’ve tried multiple versions; ebooks, illustrated editions, audiobooks, hardcover and paperback… But I can’t get past the middle of the first chapter. It’s rather frustrating."
Anxiety,Stop drinking coffee!,"Ok so for the last 15 years of my life I’ve been struggling with borderline crippling anxiety from University to my working career. I’ve drank between 2-5 cups of strong coffee a day and just went cold turkey 3 weeks ago. I don’t know if this is a placebo but my anxiety has dropped significantly!!!!

I work in IT so I’m constantly communicating with people over the phone and have people walk up to my desk every now and then. I used to be so shaky and fearful of making calls and talking to people face to face. My heart would race, id get sweaty, I would mumble my words, my breathing would get shallow. At times I would actively take a detour around the office to avoid having to communicate with people. But now…I have open conversations so much more fluently, I’m not afraid of speaking up in meetings, I’m less shaky, and overall im just more happy. Dont get me wrong i still have some anxiety but it’s so much more bearable now.

Also, I think I hit it off with a girl from my office. Conversation went so smooth, I honestly surprised myself.

TLDR; if you are a heavy coffee drinker and have anxiety, stop drinking coffee for a few weeks and see how much it helps."
Anxiety,Been working a lot lately not sure how to spend my day off..,I've been working just about everyday for the last 2 weeks and I actually kind of liked it because it kept me in a routine and keeps me from drinking. I'm taking today off to give my body some rest because I feel the workload catching up to me.. I'm really not sure how to spend my day and almost feel guilty for not going into work.. I'm worried I'm going to end up getting a bottle later and end up drinking as I have nothing else to do. I don't really have anything going on in my life other than work so yeah.. how should I go about today?
Anxiety,Has anyone found anything that helps hyper vigilance and that nasty overly self aware feeling. It’s driving me literally Fkn insane,I just wanna be able to zone off in front of the tv or reading a book but I can’t lose myself in anything I’m just so damn self conscious all the time even alone and it’s so exhausting and draining. Idk what to do or try to get out of my head and lose the obsessive self focus but nothing I try seems to help…it just goes to show how it’s gotten progressively worse through the years…I’ve always been overly self conscious but Jesus Christ I did not use to be self conscious when I was fucking alone by myself…watching a movie didn’t feel like an impossible task either. Now I just feel crazy 24/7 and disconnected from myself. I just want some semblance of sanity back.
Anxiety,Burning ears??,Has anyone had experience with having burning/red ears when anxious? I was on my way to an event yesterday and noticed my ears were all red and burning. I was feeling pretty anxious about the event but I’ve never had this kind of symptom before.
Anxiety,Always overthinking,"I hate how my brain operates. I start my clinical rotation on Tuesday (I am doing Physical Therapy School) and all I can think about is how they’ll perceive me. I am not skinny. I am actually a very large girl in the butt, hips, arms, but butt most of all. I have a small waist and stomach compared to the rest of me. This has always been my body type due to having lipedema. I don’t look terrible but I don’t look like anyone in my program. Anyways… my problem is I am afraid I won’t be taken seriously because of my looks. I had a zoom interview with my clinical instructor and all he saw was my face. I actually have a slender face with high cheekbones, my face has no fat and looks like it belongs on a leaner person. So now all I can think about is how he is not expecting how I look, and once they meet me they’ll not respect me as much as they would a person that is lean and fit. Idk… i hate this, i hate my brain, i hate how miserable i feel alll the time.."
Anxiety,i don’t know what’s wrong with me. does anyone else feel like this?,"for the past two months, i have been way too hyperaware i guess you could call it. i think too much about things i feel like i i don’t need to be thinking about, like things that are complete common sense or things that are just explained by science. for example, i think way too much about looking through my own eyes. and i’ll look down at my hands and my body and be totally tripped out. almost like i’m on drugs. i don’t know why i do this, but i do. i think way too much about why i have a little pain in my stomach or why my body hurts or why i have a headache. and here’s the worst part, i can’t take any pain medication or medicine in general because i think too much about what the medicine is doing inside my body ! like where it’s at in my body, if it’s already disintegrated, if i’m going to have some reaction to it. it just completely trips me out! even when i eat or drink, i think about the food going through my digestive system and my body like i just can’t stop thinking about things that i have to consume! it’s so weird. it doesn’t happen all day, but definitely most of it. i have episodes of it throughout the day. especially in the mornings. but at nighttime it typically goes away a little. but daytime is the worst. am i crazy? how do i stop this? it’s literally so scary. it normally lasts for hours. every single day. someone help me :("
Anxiety,Anxiety kicking in for Group Capstones,"I was diagnosed with both Major Depressive Disorder (Moderate to Severe) and General Anxiety Disorder many years back and have kept it mostly in check through therapy and medication. However, I am currently nearing the end of my coding bootcamp and we have to start working on our capstone projects. I am thankful that we get a month and a half to work on it but working in groups has always been an issue for me, whether its school or work cause I've been burned when having to rely on others to finish their part of the work. Those moments gave me anxiety and I'm getting that anxiety right now and am trying to figure out how to manage it."

Anxiety,I feel like shit today,"I did not fall asleep until 12 and I ate tons of sugary stuff yesterday, I have no history of blood sugar problems so I don't know if that caused anything, I feel dissociated, weak, tired, anxious and blank"
Anxiety,Does this sound like anxiety? Please help,"Pretty much every day I feel like I'm not myself, depersonalization, a little bit of vertigo, the shakes, weird sensations in my face/on my head, weak muscles, wake up with my shoulders clenched, random high heart rate, etc. 

It's weird because this all happens when most of the time I'm not even having anxious thoughts. It just randomly happens. 

I've had tons of blood work, been to the ER a bunch of times, etc. and nothing was ever found. Does this sound like anxiety and/or maybe even depression?"
Anxiety,Just had a bad date and it's triggering my anxiety,"I went on a date today with someone I met via a dating app. Everything was going fine until towards the end when she confessed that she lied about her living situation. She actually lives in another state and is currently crashing at a friend's place. I asked her why she didn't say that earlier and didn't get a good explanation. 

Before going on the date I did as much background check as possible and nothing seemed too fishy but once I heard this, I kind of freaked out. 

We were anyway leaving at that point so I didn't talk to her much after that and came back home. I didn't want to overreact but lying is a big red flag for me so I blocked her everywhere. 

I'm thankful that I'm back home safely but I'm quite shaken up from the whole experience. I don't know what her motives were and I can't help but overthink about how this is gonna lead to something really bad for me. Especially because I basically shared a lot of information about myself with her. 

Please help me be rational about this. Thanks!"

Anxiety,Getting out of a bad mental health phase and feeling bad about the lack of progress made,"Have you ever had this thing where you get out of a bad mental health phase in your life (in my case a phase of several years) and can no longer understand why you didn't do x y and z while you were feeling bad, and then... that makes you feel bad? 

I'll share some personal examples - I have some health issues that I've neglected for years. Didn't take medication, didn't care, couldn't be assed to go to the doctor, was anxious to take medication or try new treatments - everything felt dangerous and scary. Now I've started managing it better and taking the medication I should've started taking years ago and my physical health is doing a total 180. I'm genuinely concerned I might have damaged myself permanently by these years of not doing anything about it. I can't make myself understand why I didn't take action back then, and was allowing both my mental and physical health to deteriorate. 

Or - career. I spent those bad years really just bumming around, not doing anything productive, not trying, not making any plans, everything felt too much or too scary or too complicated. Huge hole in my resume with no good explanation beyond the fact that for some reason I wasn't capable of doing any better. Now that I've started taking some steps and am returning to school I can't for the life of me understand why I didn't do it sooner since it's making me feel so much better and hopeful about the future. 

Just looking to hear from others who can maybe relate or share their perspective. It's hard not to beat myself up for the wasted time, for allowing myself to feel worse than I needed to for so long."

Anxiety,I feel mad at god?,I can’t help but laugh at my life. That when things are going okay in a split second everything comes falling apart. And all I can do is watch. Can’t do anything at all. I just sit frozen. Blank mind. And don’t know what is happening. It feels kind of fake like stuff isn’t happening like my world isn’t crumbling. But it is. It’s a weird feeling. Head feels heavy and numb. And I just sit here. A lump in my throat. Not knowing what is gonna happen next. I’m tired. I just want this to be over now.
Anxiety,Book Suggestion Feeling Great by David Burns MD,"Hello, a while ago I read a book called feeling good by David Burns and it seemed to really help me. He has a new book now called Feeling Great that seems like a new and improved version of Feeling Good. I recommend this book to anyone struggling with depression or anxiety or any form of mental illness. If you have other book suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments. I also remember Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl being helpful. I need to read that again. I’ve read a few more and am going to reread them so I’ll be able to suggest a few more but the two I mentioned are great."
Anxiety,How much day to day anxiety is normal?,
Anxiety,Constant anxiety makes my heart ache and my stomach spin.,"Long story short, for these past 6 months I've been having constant anxiety about bumping somehow into the girls that bully me (17M). The reason that they started bullying me is that 3 years ago one of the girls that also lives on my floor invited them over and they ding dong ditched my apartment for weeks, one day I just called the cops and the cop basically did nothing when he confronted them and from that day on they started calling me out when they see me, calling me by my name just to laugh when I look at them and they also called me a snitch, ""f\*\*\*ot"", etc.. 

They are a grade under me, and I only started worrying about them 6 months ago when one day when they mocked me in recess and after that I went to my teacher and told him the story without telling their names to him because I wanted to see what he can do about it, he ""opened"" my eyes when he told me that they are basically bullying me and that this is serious.. he advised me to confront the girl that lives on my floor and I did. that day I knocked on her door, she opened, and I told her that if they do one more thing  I will tell their names to the teacher, she said ok and I went back to my apartment. it only happened again 2 times these 6 months and those two times I managed to stand for myself and told them to shut up.

but.. now I have this constant heart-ache and stomach butterflies whenever I am at school or just outside hanging with my friends or even at my house... If I'm outside I worry about seeing them again and bumping into the full group (they are lik 8 girls..)  It influences my mental state so much I have a thought about them every 1 hour at least. I tried sharing this with my friends, tried mocking them back, meditating , working out, talking to my parents but nothing helped my constant anxiety.

I am a person that doesn't like fighting and conflicts and at this point I literally don't know what to do...."
Anxiety,"Anxious thinking that my boyfriend's sister, who's visiting, has COVID right now.","Stayed over at my boyfriend's house. His younger sister came over for the long weekend. She lives in San Diego. She just told us that a coworker that works closely to her just tested positive for COVID. She's fully vaccinated but constantly goes to raves, were she's maskless. She took a Covid test 3 days after the rave and came out negative.

Her coworker went to a concert and also took a test 3 days later and was negative. But suddenly tested positive on another test check up...My boyfriend's sister says she feels fine and doesn't think she should go buy a rapid test...I have heard her cough a few times though.... :( 

Also, I thought you don't show symptoms after two weeks. Has this changed? Seems a bit silly to me to think your covid results would be ok after potentially being exposed 3 days before taking a test.

Anxiety,Can't Stop Thinking About Breathing?,"Y'know how you can see your nose in your field of vision but you don't notice it unless someone draws attention to it? That's what my breathing feels like. I can breathe easily until, for whatever reason, my attention is drawn to it.

It's like I have to think about breathing to do it. Instead of it being mindless, like the way you walk (it's just one foot in front of the other. simple), I can't stop thinking about it and it makes me feel like I'm having a hard time breathing. It makes me feel anxious, like there's a reason I can't breathe that I'm not aware of. And it feels like I'm being ridiculous at the same time."

Anxiety,Withdrawal from propanolol,"Hi all,

I've been on propanolol for about 4 years (40mg TDS) and have decided with my doctor to come off it - no positive effect anymore and lots of side effects (bradycardia, pins and needles etc). I titrated down over a couple of months and its It's been about 3 weeks since I stopped altogether, I was expecting increased anxiety for a week or so due to increased beta-adrenergic sensitivity but I still have high heart rate/palpitations at times (100-120 at rest, 140 when standing). This comes and goes, any exercise results in prolonged high heart rate.i can get it down to 85 if I stay still for a few hours. BP is ok when I've been resting for a while but very variable. Heart rate at night is fine (55-60 at its lowest) so I am guessing it is just my sympathetic immune system going bonkers. Has anyone else had experience of this, and any ideas as to how long to expect it to last? I'm working with doctor, they have been giving me diazepam to get through (no effect on heart rate but helps deal with it) but obviously not a long term solution due to tolerance/addiction. I really don't want to go back on beta blockers as they make me feel awful."
Anxiety,Throwing up every morning due to my anxiety,"So recently about a month ago I was actually sick with a bacteria, during that whole time I though I was going to literally die.

Once I got better (around 2 weeks ago) I was doing fine but the only problem was I was relying on weed (carts) to make me feel better. I also use nicotine but I’ll try to quit that another day.

I went to my friends house and started to feel overwhelmed because ( I know this sounds wierd) I like to sleep at my house where I have people who I can talk to and I just feel more relaxed in general.

2 days ago I ended up giving my weed (dabpen) to my parents and decided I would try to quit. 

Now I wouldn’t say that weed caused my anxiety because I’ve had it since I was 13 (now 16) but it definitely helped me during the 2 month span I used it. 

Anyway back to the main point, the last few mornings I have been waking up and feeling SUPER anxious and sick because since I don’t eat enough and have high anxiety. I have throw up like 5 times within the last two mornings. 

All I’m wondering though is does anyone know how to break this annoying cycle and does anyone else even have this?

Ps: All I’ve been “eating” in the last few days are smoothies and drinks."
Anxiety,Reality vs. Anxiety,"How do you tell the difference?  

I’ve been in situations where I thought my car was breaking down, admissions to the ER,  gas leaks, etc, only to find out “there’s nothing wrong”.  Now, I’m not sure what’s real. There was a strong chemical odor in home today, but after these experiences I now tell myself that I’m only imagining it.  I did not call my landlord. I’m tired of bothering others for nothing. 

What if the smell was real? What if I really am sick and need to see a doctor? Is my car actually breaking down? How do you tell the difference between reality and anxiety?  

It’s scary to no longer trust your own judgement"
Anxiety,Hypocondria,I lost my mom in January to cancer and since then I’ve been experiencing daily health anxieties. Worried I’m sick or I’m dying. I had to be her care taker so I watched her become more and more sick until she couldn’t do it anymore. Every day I find myself feeling throbs all over and I’m constantly looking for something whether it’s lumps or aches. I don’t know how to stop myself and I’ve been to check up doctors just to make sure I’m fine and everything comes back normal but I can’t get rid of the throbs. I can’t help but think I’m not okay and the logical part of me says I’m probably causing these pains because I’m so afraid but then there’s that illogical part of me that can’t seem to match up and believe I’m okay. I really don’t know what to do anymore
Anxiety,I just can't take it anymore," 

(English is not my first language, sorry if I make any mistakes)

I have no idea why I am writing this! It makes no sense to bitch and moan about my problems to Internet strangers, but I just can't handle having this inside of me and having no-one to just shut up and listen! Allow me to share a little bit of my story, please? Call it my farewell to arms in a way!

I had my first mental breakdown in 2018 after a painful break up, my best friend suicide and having a bout with alcoholism which caused me to be admitted in a psychiatric hospital for the first time. After 34 days at the looney bin, I was first diagnosed with bipolar, ptsd and depression at the tender age of 23. Since that first mental breakdown, I've been admitted once again in psychiatric ward last year after I attempted suicide (it was close) and I lost control over my life ever since. I can't focus on my college classes and can't handle the simplest jobs, If it wasn't for my government giving me a very, very small pension that in a month will the turned into a invalid retirement fund I wouldn't have any income.

I've been fighting a loosing war against this conditions: depression, ptsd due to sexual abuse when I was a kid, and the ups and downs. I've quit drinking and smoking weed entirely after my first admission at the hospital, I've been on all sorts of medication, I've tried every sort of psychological treatment and therapies, I even tried religious rituals (more to please my parents than for actually believing). I am just too tired of fighting, I am too tired of living day after day and having nothing to show but college debt, loneliness and scars from self harming.

Is this all that I can expect from life? Poverty, misery, brutally painful flashbacks and a stigma of people thinking I am insane due to my mental illnesses, prejudice against my bisexuality and such low self esteem that I literally feel like a burden on everyone else? That doesn't sound very fair to me, but again, I don't think life is supposed to be fair, right?

All comes down to that magic bullet, the exit button that is always hunting me. Last time I tried to commit suicide I used sleeping pills, a shit tone of them, and I barely escaped, this time I have my grandpa old 38 revolver and one single round of ammunition. I am not saying I'm gonna do it, but knowing that it exists! That there's a way out, it really helps, it gives me a North, makes me feel less helpless in knowing that, for everything I can't control, I can control the way out!

It feels like I am already dead, a ghost! A husk of the man I used to be before my mental breakdown. I have no friends, no family besides a borderline afflicted mom and a pathological liar of a dad, I don't feel passion for anything anymore, I don't have ambitions of goals, I don't have anything to my name, no pride or self love left, I honestly hate myself with every fiber of my being, to the point that every waking moment is a struggle and I can only find peace after taking midazolam and falling asleep. I am running out of excuses to continue alive!

Thank you for reading!"
Anxiety,Do lists help?,"I use a day planner just to remember appointments, but I've been thinking of writing a daily checklist for myself...things such as showering, exercising, cleaning tasks, and errands.

I feel my mind grabs onto stuff and overthinks until I'm stressed to the point of having an anxiety attack, and that's when dark thoughts (ex: I'd be better off dead) crawl in.

If I focus on powering through a list, will it help alleviate my anxiety?"
Anxiety,Second day at new job,And socially I'm actually doing alright compared to how mentally and physically exhausting this is 😰. At least the constant flow of customers means I can't ruminate over my mistakes. Still very difficult though. I feel lazy wanting to go home already
Anxiety,Around people,"My post is about a problem I desperately need to get rid of.

When I am around people, for example in a coffee place, classroom, tram or office, I get tense and start focusing on every move of these people, instead of focusing on my book or on the blackboard...

I react to their every move, meaning when they adjust themselves, I blink, scratch my head or look at them.

This makes them visibly irritated, as it goes on and on + I can't focus on what I am doing. 

Then I get frustrated that I am hurting them, and drift from my subject of focus even further, only to see that I understood nothing from the book or the lecture at the end of the day.

So, to sum it up, I am hyper aware of people surrounding me in closed environments visually and it leads to not finishing my work, getting stiff trapeze and also making people around me frustrated.

Did you suffer from the same symptoms/how did you solve it?"
Anxiety,Feels like my mind is against me,"I felt pretty good in the last weeks, and even though I noticed in the past days that my anxiety/depression is popping up here and there, I wasn't prepared to be swarmed with negative thoughts and have bad (psychological) nightmares that make me guilt-trip for no reason. It's like my mind doesn't want me to catch a break, no matter how hard I try to stay mentally healthy..."
Anxiety,Fixing a broken bridge.,My anxiety caused me to frequently become overwhelmed and angry. I thought I lost several friends permanently. Today was board game night where I'd met a friend/ex 1.5 years ago. 11 months ago i finally broke the bridge with my anxiety and aggression. The friend had told me we would no longer be hanging out because they didn't want to be responsible for my behaviors. Tonight we were both at games again since things are open in my area. At the end of games I was invited over. However due to not having any of my over night stuff on hand I had to decline. I've changed a lot due to the help of therapy and recently meds. I am able to enjoy things I didn't used to enjoy. My friend trusts me just enough again and I didn't realize it until 20 minutes after we parted ways.
Anxiety,am i overreacting,"tldr- I’ve convinced myself that my (supposed) panic attacks are actually an underlying medical condition &amp; I want to know if going to the doctor is a waste of time.

A month ago I went to the ER for tingling &amp; shaking and was told by my doctor that I had a panic attack and not some life-threatening untreatable illness. It was the middle of the night. Now, it’s a month later and it happened again.

This time, also at night, it started with tightness in my throat which led to tingling sensations in my face, hands, and legs. I felt lightheaded like I was going to pass out and my hands were curling into themselves. My stomach also felt tight, like there was a knot in it and I was shaking so hard I could barely take a breath. 

I was able to calm myself down by breathing into a paper bag and squeezing a stress ball. Ten minutes later, my throat felt tight and it happened all over again. Calmed down, and a little while later it happened again. I was finally able to calm down and fall asleep. 

In the morning, I woke up with my throat still feeling a little tight, a bit lightheaded and mostly downright exhausted. I laid there for a bit trying to ignore the tightening sensation, but I ended up focusing on it too much and had another episode. Throughout the whole day I’ve been feeling this tightness off and on, like I’m always on the brink of another supposed panic attack.

Is it possible to have multiple panic attacks in the span of a couple hours? Or could it potentially be an underlying medical issue? And can certain symptoms linger? I’ve done a lot of reading of other people’s panic attack experiences and it seems like the symptoms are supposed to disappear when you aren’t having an attack. 

Anyways, I have an appointment with my doctor to get a blood test and see a neurologist for the tingling that happened. I want to know what everyone else thinks though. Taking all this into consideration, am I crazy for wanting more tests done?"
Anxiety,Officially diagnosed with depersonalization derealization disorder after a year and a half,"Hey. I've been stuck in a continuous episode of depersonalization for a year and a half now, stemming from a multitude of horrific events simultaneously occuring in my life.

 At the start of 2020 I had a very painful, terrible breakup, just barely failed out of school, all to become sick to an indescribable degree, get diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis, dropped out to the aforementioned, caught Covid just as news of the disease was spreading and nearly died, lost the one solid opportunity of employment that I had, and then watched my grandmother pass and then my uncle a week later due to his alcoholism. 

The few acquaintances I had abandoned me. Relatives stopped speaking to me. I was binge drinking, popping bars, smoking weed, etc. I managed to put on 80lbs in this time frame. 

In regards to the DP/R, I dismissed it as just yet another anxiety symptom that would pass. But as it may already be clear, it soon came to consume my life up to this point. I've lost what little I had, accomplished nothing, and spiraling into this detached form of reality. 

Finally though, finally someone acknowledged that this was a serious issue. My therapist has recommended a PHP/IOP, and I'm hopeful that it's actually something I can afford. Maybe I'll regain a sense of normalcy, one day."
Anxiety,What is the Difference Between Stammering and Stuttering?,"Have you ever asked yourself, ""what is the difference between stammering and stuttering?"". Stuttering or stammering is a speech disorder where you repeat certain syllables or sounds while you are talking. It gives people the impression that you are uncomfortable in the situation or unsure of yourself. 

They can quite literally hear the fear in your voice. For this reason, many people want to quit their stammering and end the problems that it creates. [Watch on to know more...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMdr3saRDp4)"

Anxiety,Low blood pressure and fastish heart rate,"So went to docs today cause I've been having a huge struggle with daily anxiety. Did some tests for kidneys. But she tested my blood pressure and heart rate and seemed quite concerned it was like 77/80 which is getting down and my bpm was 85 which she said was a little high. 

Has anybody with anxiety had any issues with blood pressure going low? And what sort of resting heart rate are you getting? 

Shits got me worried a little."
Anxiety,Covid anxiety &amp; rant,"About six days ago my sister got sick, she refused to get tested for covid for the first two days… I kept my distance from her thankfully because of my fear of getting sick. My mom started to feel bad and so did I, just a little headache and such. We both got tested for covid and didn’t have it, but my sisters symptoms got worse so she finally went and got tested after days of begging (no idea why she was so defiant. It makes me mad.) Turned out she was positive, and my anxiety since then has just been the worst. I tested negative a second time so I decided to go get my covid vaccine to ease my anxiety, but it only made it worse. I had to delete google from my phone to stop me from googling random symptoms. I’ve cried a lot and had panic attacks which only make me more scared, thankfully my mom tries to comfort me but I can tell I’m stressing her out. It really sucks, I wish I could be normal. I ended up going to the ER from feeling dizzy and the doctor told me it sounds like vertigo… Has anyone else ever had vertigo from extreme stress or anxiety? I am also scared to get the second dose now lol"

Anxiety,anxiety is ruining my relationship,I’m so heartbroken and i don’t know how to fix this situation. about three months ago my boyfriend moved long distance. i can’t sleep out there due to my anxiety and i never really have been able to sleep anywhere except a handful of times. My boyfriend got mad at me and told me i use my anxiety as a crutch and i don’t put in effort. He said that my anxiety is getting in the way of the relationship and both him and his dad think i’m making excuses. idk how to be with somebody that doesn’t understand me. i’m also upset that my anxiety is getting in the way of something once again.
Anxiety,Anxiety about pulse,My heart rate dropped to 62 when standing up usually it would increase right? And now I'm anxious I looked up and found that it could be a vasovagal response? It still arouses my anxiety. It did go back up though.
Anxiety,Work anxiety,"I am a floor manager in a medium sized factory for food production. My main task includes preparing the orders for daily delivery. This inevitably branches out to making sure we have enough stock for the usually standard weekly orders. As well as making extra as holding stock. I know the ins and outs of what needs to be done for the orders on a weekly basis and the daily routine to complete it. But clearly that’s not enough for me. The issue I think I have and where my intense (starting to think crippling) anxiety stems from is the time pressure. Also the customers needing the stock almost immediately.

I need to complete orders under time pressure as the delivery load needs to leave early the next day with the driver as soon as he comes into work. Not only that, but we also have orders that come in anytime of day for collection that need to be ready for when they arrive. The time pressure and the pressure my superiors are giving me to do all of it is seriously effecting my mental. 

I have so much anxiety that when I’m at home I’m thinking about what I need to do and start stressing. I go to bed and my skin is tingling with anxiety… I just can’t handle it anymore. It’s bad, very bad. Surprisingly I don’t mind the actual work of prepping the order, in truth I actually like it and I learn so much about the food we produce. It’s just the time pressure…not sure if I should leave this job because my health should come first no matter what.

Thank you to anybody for reading. I posted this hoping someone can offer me some advice and also just to vent."
Anxiety,Never ending anxiety ATTACK.,"My anxiety is more than just anxiety, it’s an anxiety attack that doesn’t stop. I can’t sleep, I can’t leave my bed, I can’t stop shaking. It feels like I’m going to die as I type this and the sensation never goes away. It’s 2am and this has been going on to this degree since 6pm. I’ve held out for the past EIGHT hours like this but can’t take another minute. It took me 15 minutes to type this paragraph. I have to drink alcohol to calm down or I’m going to kill myself."

Anxiety,breakup and venting,"My boyfriend of 2 and a half years broke up with me. still on good terms, he just needs time for himself now. i’m trying so hard to be good about this and understand, but i feel so broken my heart is literally aching. i’m just sitting here and it’s 530 AM and i’m just filled with anxiety about this. he made it seem like there was a chance we can get back together again in the future and i’m just trying to as positive and hopeful about this but i don’t wanna get my hopes up too high in case he doesn’t. he helped me so much with my mental health and helped me get through some of the toughest things in my life and it’s so hard to believe now that we aren’t together anymore. I feel like i can’t do this i am so upset and thinking about wether he’ll get back with me or not in the future is making me so anxious. I wish so bad that this didn’t have to happen. i feel like i can’t breath. but yeah, just venting i guess."

Anxiety,Dating anxiety,"Recently started seeing someone within the last month. Obviously too early for exclusivity but I’m pretty sure their seeing other people and it’s getting the best of my anxiety. Idk why but dating is hard enough as is with my mental health, feeling like I’m competing is making is so much worse. My anxiety has been horrendous and idk wtf to do, cuz there’s essentially nothing I can do. Feeling pretty hopeless."
Anxiety,do I have anxiety or am I just nervous,"Hi everyone! I just wanted to share my story and hopefully get some insight on what’s happening to me and how to cope. I’m a rising junior in hs and I am very stressed, like EXTREMELY stressed about applying to college next year. When i’m not at my day job I constantly think about everything I did/am doing wrong.. from a bad AP score to poor extracurriculars. It’s all I can think about. I binge “how I got into ___ university” videos and SAT prep videos every night for the past month. I physically cannot sleep before 4am because I think i’m wasting time by sleeping. Any ideas how to chill out?"
Anxiety,So anxious that I've been nauseous for 5 days in a row. Help!,"My husband recently lost his job and I'm just so anxious about everything I can hardly function. We're not in any immediate panic danger money wise (although it's not comfy until he gets another job) so I know it's ridiculous to be this stressed but I just can't seem to stop.   


  


Since we got the news it's just been panic and nasuea every single day, I don't think I've eaten and kept down a meal since Saturday.

  


I know I have no control over this situation and I absolutely trust my husband to find another job soon and figure everything out. But in the mean time I have no idea how to let go of all this stress and panic.

  


When I tell my husband he's extremely supportive and wonderful, but then I feel like shit for making him deal with my panic and emotions when he's already dealing with so much.

  


I feel like there's no escape from this misery until he gets a job, but it's not sustainable for me to just keep trying to ignore/suppress these feelings until that happens.

  


Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated!!"
Anxiety,Girlfriend is upset because I don’t want to get vaccinated,I’m not antivax at all. I just don’t feel comfortable getting it. And my girlfriend is mad about. I have a feeling she’s going to break up with me over it and if she does I’d honestly go into a deep depression. Idk what to do.
Anxiety,PCP vs Psychiatry for medication management,"I got the results from my Neuropsych testing (turns out my ADHD symptoms were just my anxiety in a Scooby Doo villain mask) and the psychologist recommended new meds, specifically ones that target anxiety and possibly a cocktail to help manage these symptoms along with my continued Therapy. 

I feel like I’ve tried every SSRI in the book (back to Fluoxetine/Prozac) and I felt like I was getting the max benefit from medication that I could. I’m pretty excited that there could be other options out there that could help me more. 

I’m on waitlists for psychiatry and it reasonably could be a year until I get in with someone. 

I have a new PCP I haven’t met yet but is overall highly rated in general as caring, good listener, etc. My experience with primary care is to just throw a different SSRI med at me or raise the dose. 

I don’t know if it’s worth going to a general doctor for this, but I also don’t want to just wait around until psychiatry calls me to schedule. 

Does anyone have positive experiences using their primary doc for the medication side of things?"
Anxiety,I can't understand myself at all (tg: frustration),"Hi, i can't understand myself at all. When someone teases me, I get offended easily and always having the urge to cry because of frustration. When I play a game and I get shot or die repeatedly without having a chance to fight back (im a noob), I get frustrated and cry easily. I always cry because of petty things. When someone is asking me to do things in repetition, I always feel frustrated. I don't even want to cry but my chest just feels so heavy and I'm always flooded with a lot of thoughts such as ""why am I like this?"" ""I played this game a thousand times already, why am I still not better at it?"" ""how can I respond in this situation calmly?"" ""why am I always offended?"" I just don't understand why. I tried to be calm many times, I tried everything I could to stop my emotions. I tried to conquer my thoughts and think about other things, too. I always distract myself like watching funny videos and memes when I feel like my frustration is kicking in. I always suppress my emotions and swallow everything I feel inside, trying to run away from it but it always come back. It comes back worse, and heavier. I really wanted to go to a psychiatrist because I think something is wrong with me. Not only crying but when I feel frustrated I always hurt myself physically. Punching my head, pinching myself, punching myself as hard as I can so that I can ease my frustration. What do I do"
Anxiety,Am I annoying,"A lot of times I feel like I might be the most annoying person on the planet. I feel as though everyone I meet for the first time doesn't like me. I wonder if there is an inflection in my voice that makes me sound like I am not neurotypical (you know the tone, and I have been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety) and people just want me to leave or that I may not be competent to do simple jobs. Nothing in my life has lead up to proving that. I've never been told that, and typically people do talk to me again of their own accord, I also have a rather nice size group of friends. So I really don't know where these thoughts came from. Not to mention I work as an EMT (which I love doing) and many patients gravitate towards me as who they want to speak with. But I tell myself all the time you talk too much or why did you even have to speak it's more normal to keep your head down. I really care too much about the opinion of others as until the day I die I will have to work with other people. Anyone have any ways with coping that they think they are just bothering everyone you talk to (minus of course a patient of 911 I know they want to talk to me)."

Anxiety,Can't stop panicking in training at my new job,"I started a new job a week and a half ago however my area of my country is in a lockdown and I have started my job remotely working from home. I have no prior experience in this field and I keep panicking that I'm not good enough or I'm making too many mistakes. 

I know I'm still new but I don't want to let anyone down and I feel like I'm not progressing at a fast enough pace. It is my first time working from home let alone learning a completely new role and systems by myself at home. I'm so anxious I'm going to get fired for not being good enough."
Anxiety,I’m struggling to eat because I get stressed about cooking and therefore I skip meals,"Recently, I’ve not been eating and I have been skipping meals because it gets me stressed about cooking them. 

The worst thing is that because I skip meals, I feel angry and anxious all the time! It’s a viscous circle and won’t stop 😔

Anxiety,Is this normal or critical?,"Suddenly, I got a sudden burst/rush of dizziness and fatigue, and now I’m feeling continuously dizzy/nauseous right after that burst.

Anxiety,How do I self soothe when I get panic attacks and really bad stomach ache from anxiety,"I have been receiving bad news and things haven’t been working well in my life.

I have taken shower, done deep breaths, do yoga and try to calm for 30 mins. How do I self soothe? Those things aren’t working well.

Anxiety,I’m growing up in a cult-like family &amp; I’m alone and scared,"I have a standard family. If standard means grown assholes causing severe anxiety every waking second and having a blatantly traumatic childhood of getting forced to be happy to cover the trauma. Then yes, my family is standard. My “family” is dangerously like a cult.

I am in a cult. I was fucking born into a cult. When I subconsciously wandered my emotional wellbeing away from the crazy traumatic events of my life when I was younger (when i was 6), I saw a better way to live than being a toy that my parents and everyone around me grew tired of. That ‘fantasy’ grew as I grew and now that I’m 16, I can’t continue living somewhere that doesn’t make any sense when I know that there’s something better out there. I won’t come back to this; First thing I gotta do is get out first. But I can’t get out easily. I can but I at least need someone to remind me of that ideal place as I’m carrying the weight of growing up in a fucked up cult-like place, which I can’t get because my personality type is INTJ. I’m not crazy

Things are only getting worse as I continue being stuck here and knowing somthing better. I’m starting to lose myself. I’m not kidding, I can’t function properly in terms of having a healthy personality or healthy anything. I have had severe depression, existential crisis, mental problems that I have never gotten help for apart from my own I’m young, I DONT KNOW SHIT. I’m terrified of what will happen to me when I continue to stay. I know things have to be worse before it gets better but when? When does it get better? When I reach the edge for the umpteenth time and feel the only way to escape is to kill myself (happened once already). This isn’t just some homework that’s almost due problem. This is my life that’s affecting my and a threat to my existence as a whole. I am tired of people telling me to wait and that I’ll eventually get there. It doesn’t work like THAT!!!! When you’re aware, you’d have to be able to leave that place but I can’t!!!!!! It’s only making things worse and worse until I’m lost completely."
Anxiety,Canceled my wisdom teeth removal at the last minute and my dentist office was obviously pissed and now I can’t stop crying knowing they are upset with me,"I don’t know where else to post this. I was scheduled to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow morning, and I ended up rescheduling it this morning because I’m going camping on August 11 and I didn’t realize how invasive this procedure is. I don’t want to deal with possible infections and all the other crap that goes with getting your wisdom teeth out while I’m on vacation. When I first scheduled to get them removed I thought I would be fine after a couple days, but after doing some last minute research I found that it takes a lot of people 2 weeks or even more to go back to normal. 

Anyway, when I called my dentist office to reschedule, they said to me “you do realize we won’t able to fill that surgery in because you canceled last minute” in a VERY passive aggressive tone. I said I am sorry, I didn’t realize how invasive this procedure is. They still let me reschedule but I can’t shake this overwhelming feeling of guilt and anxiety that they will fuck up my teeth when they do remove them as revenge (I know that is pure anxiety in my head I am a legal professional and know that is medical malpractice but I still can’t help thinking that way). I feel really guilty for rescheduling. How do I stop feeling like this? I wish I didn’t care so much about what others thought of me it drives me insane."
Anxiety,Who has experience with Lexapro?,"Like two months ago my doctor prescribed me escitalopram for my anxiety. I filled the prescription but put off taking it because I have severe Health Anxiety and often get side effects whenever I take medication. I had been reading the list of side effects on Wikipedia (as I do with all the other meds ever prescribed to me) and get spooked about things like risk of suicide, paresthesia (which I have gotten as a side effect on other medications), and heart problems, something called long qt syndrome. I’ve gotten bad side effects from other medication which is what scares me into taking stuff. 

But I’m not sure I can hold off taking it anymore. I feel like my anxiety has worsened into depression. My husband was diagnosed with cancer and cannot get surgery because our hospitals are filled with covid patients. I have physical symptoms of anxiety every day like muscle pain, nausea, chest pain, SOB, etc- which makes my health anxiety even worse because I constantly have the fear of death, of even sleeping at night. Everything with COVID, I have a young child I have to send to school this year, I’m terrified of her getting sick. I have no family around me in the state I live in and feel isolated. This morning while playing with my kid I just started crying. Every morning when I wake up I hope it will be a better day but it just isn’t. 

Does anyone take lexapro? I’m at the point where I think I seriously need help but I’m still terrified of the side effects of the medication. Any words of wisdom please."

I had an MRI in Feb 2020 last year , and a brain CT scan in march and also a EEG in April all was normal visited the ER and they said I only had a ct scan in march and all was good it's anxiety and the family doctor told me the same and they also said I only had a MRI last year , I don't need a repeat could none of them being non contrast affect the results. I visited a neurologist in Nov 2019 and he ordered the MRI but it was bad dizziness I was experiencing."
Anxiety,Does my friend hate me or is it just my anxiety,"Idk of this is the right place for this but whatever I’m desperate. I don’t really have any friends, but I recently reconnected with someone from elementary school. We texted a lot Sunday and Monday. We have a small conversation Tuesday. I ask a few questions and then they just never responded. It’s Thursday now and I’m getting worried that maybe I said something wrong? I’ve read everything over and I don’t think I did but I can’t stop the feeling. Basically, do you think they hate me or am I overreacting?"

Anxiety,Need help on intrusive thoughts and getting out of the cycle.,"TL;DR - I struggle with intrusive thoughts and with always wanting to ""get my thoughts in order."" But end up reassuring myself way too much by trying to get it sorted. And while I don't worry too much over anything else now, but the only thing I get anxious about is my anxiety. As in, wanting to accept it as a normal human emotion and not reject it everytime. I struggle with ""what ifs"" that revolve around long term struggles like ""what if I always struggle with this?"" Advice needed!

The whole story:

So I was doing very well for so many months now since my last setback. I was moving forward and couldn't have been more thankful.

However, few days ago, I ended up feeling weird (a different symptom) and relating it to the time when I was struggling a lot. So I ended up overthinking a lot and got set back. I need some help with a few things.

I realized that while I don't really get scared or anxious over any situation or condition now, what I do fear is my ""anxiety."" I know its emotion/feeling that everyone deals with and it isn't inherently wrong but we're here because we all need some help managing it and using it in the correct situations. And now the only thing that's getting me anxious is my anxiety and the thought that it'll keep returning.

I struggle with intrusive thoughts which mostly focus around long time struggles like ""what if its always this way?"" And I find myself coming up with solutions as a form of reassurance and I keep repeating that reassurance to myself whenever the thought of anxiety comes to mind which is many times a day. 

Yesterday I ended up trying to explain myself that ""its okay to experience anxiety. Its a normal human emotion. Its not a feeling you need to be afraid of. And there is no other problem that you have to solve. So just let it go."" But I just ended up repeating that thought continuously and it was exhausting.

While going to bed, I remembered the time from last year when I used to experience trembling and shaking due to fear but back then, I was worrying about my health (I experienced chronic acid reflux) so there was a reason. This time, however, that bad memory of shaking just came up and I started worrying about it immediately. Usually I can manage it fine and its been like many months since I experienced it once last time but this time, the only trigger was that memory.

Since I struggled with it around Aug/Sep last year (after that it gradually got better), this time around, since August has began again, its just bringing back the memories of anxiety from back then. Those memories are getting me anxious again and I'm immediately thinking about the worst case scenario which, in my case, is me always struggling with this. Its a pretty crazy thought I know and far-fetched too but its still getting me all jittery.

If you read through this, thank you so much! It'd be great if I could receive some advice on how to overcome this."
Anxiety,Any methods to deal with fear of panicking while speaking to a group?,"I've been dealing with some panic problems for a while now, but most of the problems have been solved after reading through half of the Mastery of Panic and anxiety workbook.

I previously dealt with (and still do a bit, but it's much easier now) fear of leaving home, going to the supermarket, all that sort of stuff because I realised I was fearful of becoming frozen and not being able to leave a place, losing control or collapsing, all this sort of stuff but after reading the workbook I don't fear anxiety in those situations anymore, because I know now that panic and anxiety can't do those things, and is really just there to protect me and will help me run away, not freeze or collapse. 

However, I have this one persistent fear that I'm struggling to let go of in a similar way to the others. I have a really bad fear of speaking in class, even though I'm a confident speaker and an extrovert. I've done a lot of public speaking and before I started to have problems with panic, I loved to public speak. I'm not fearful of making a mistake because I don't care about that sort of stuff, I'm scared that I'll have an awful panic attack and start freaking out so badly that I decide to bail out of speaking, or say something like 'sorry I'm really anxious, I've gotta go' and then leave. And it's just super depressing because i love learning and going to class, but this fear makes it really hard to enjoy. 

In my head I'm always trying to go against that and think to myself that bailing out isn't so bad, that I've always persisted through public speaking panic attacks before, that it can't hurt me and so on and so on. But I feel like there's a little bit of me that's still really fearful of this event happening and I can't seem to let it go like the other fears. 

So, has anyone else experienced this? What methods did you use to help you let go of this fear of panicking while speaking in front of a class/group?"

Anxiety,"Unhappy in current job, extremely fearful about leaving. Please help me see sense.","Hello, I suffer with GAD.

Tldr at the bottom. 

I am in a relatively senior position within a company so very few people know. Due to my role's busy nature my anxiety often doesn't cause an issue as I'm able to keep myself distracted. However recently, and I suspect its related to tiredness and the toxic nature of my workplace, my anxiety is beginning to flare up pretty dramatically. I almost feel as if my brain actively searches for something to be worried about and when it finds something, no matter how minor, it cripples me for the next two or three days. 

This has now started to happen at work due to the massive pressure on my shoulders. 

Friends have told me to just quit, but because I have a young family I'm petrified of leaving my position and not being able to provide for them or find a new job, despite me knowing my role will likely lead me to an early grave, and has already impacted my relationship with my wife as I'm often too tired to talk at the end of the day. 

I have a friend who I wish I could emulate, he has twice quit good positions in companies with nothing to go to but isn't afraid and often finds something better relatively Quickly. I wish to God I could have this mindset. 

I would love some thoughts and suggestions

Tldr: I want to leave my toxic role but the fear of not being able to provide for my family or find another role is preventing me. Please help me put things in perspective."

Anxiety,I’ve almost tapered down to half my daily ativan prescription and I haven’t re-developed Akathisia! (a MASSIVE fear of mine) :),"TW MULTIPLE

I know meds don’t have a ton to do w/anxiety but my anxiety about this did 😂.

I got akathisia in November 2019 from the respiridone I was taking at the time (“for anxiety” 🙄). Went through a hellish withdrawal over that winter while simultaneously dealing with akathisia, I.e. the most absolutely horrible thing I’ve ever experienced in my life (and I’ve been through a lot of shitty things). 

Shell shocked I was okay for a few weeks and then started having panic attacks again so my psychiatrist put me on f*cking HALDOL as needed for them. Needless to say, HALDOL. A first generation incredibly potent antipsychotic known for extreme side effects triggered severe severe severe akathisia in me. I took it twice. The akathisia didn’t go away for weeks. It was so bad all I could do all day was lie in the bathtub and sob and wish I was dead (even though I wasn’t depressed at the time so I really didn’t want to die. But nobody can live like that). I cannot describe the horror of severe akathisia. People pace until their feet are bloody. It makes you want to peel your skin off. It is the most HORRIBLE restlessness. It is the most horrible feeling you can possibly feel and I stand by that. I’ve been abused as a child physically and emotionally. I’ve been r*ped. Had severe GAD, OCD, MDD, and BPD (really played collect em all). I’ve attempted s**c*de from the MDD. Been locked in a concrete room to scream and bang my head on the wall (2018 was a rough year). And I get severe migraines occasionally and had cluster headaches. 

Nothing I’ve ever experienced in my life has come a FRACTION close to akathisia. Even the respiridone akathisia which was not nearly as bad as the haldol akathisia.

I think maybe some forms of horrible torture and death probably are worse (though akathisia was induced in people as a torture method both by the nazis and in the Russian gulags), but psychologically I think it’s hard to beat. 

Anyway sorry for the pretty dramatic description but I just feel strongly that you cannot imagine how bad it is until you feel it (and there are degrees to the horribleness. Haldol akathisia was especially bad). 


Anyway my psychiatrist put me on as needed klonopin for it which helped but klonopin makes me suicidal so I wound up in the ER where they gave me a twice daily ativan prescription. It got rid of the akathisia without making me depressed so my doctor approved it for me to keep taking and I’ve been on it since (this as feb 2020). Haven’t had akathisia since either (though the fear of it returning lasted a while).


I built a tolerance to it around fall. And it has negative side effects like low energy, hazy mentally (am on other stuff too that’s sedating - lamictal and a very high dose of gabapentin), etc. But I was so so scared to taper off it because one of the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal is akathisia.


Still, it’s not safe long term and I did really want to get off it so this summer me and my psychiatrist made a plan for a really slow taper (my brain is sensitive so this was especially necessary). I took it twice a day which was 14 pills a week so each week I would take one less pill (by generally reducing two days by half a pill). It’s been working really well and while I might have to take a break for a week or so or switch to half a pill less because I’ve been having pretty strong mood swings (I also have bpd so those need to be avoided), I’m almost down to taking one pill a day split in half. And while I’ve had some amount of restlessness some of the time (another reason to pause- my psychiatrist says I can just stay on that dose for the time being if I want to but ideally I want to switch to it being as needed so hopefully after I stabilize a bit more I can taper slowly again), there has been no akathisia!! Also weirdly no anxiety just a bit reckless and restless and a bit more mood swingy (and a nasty headache). 

Anyway I know this is really long but this is a big victory for me because I as so so so absolutely terrified of akathisia that I didn’t want to ever taper off it even tho it wasn’t helping anymore and I didn’t like it and it would’ve been better as an as needed medicine. 

It’s definitely a victory over my anxiety even if it took me a year and a half to be able to. And it’s helped with the fear of akathisia returning and the fear of any sort of restlessness or boredom being akathisia (impossible but- anxiety).

Sorry this is so long. TLDR I was terrified that tapering off ativan would bring my akathisia back but it didn’t and it’s a major victory for me in terms of conquering my anxiety :)."

Anxiety,Anxiety about barbers,Hi guys hope you’re all okay basically an experience I had two years ago gave me anxiety ! What happened was I was sitting in the barbers chair and as he was cutting my hair out of nowhere a sudden intense dizziness happened and I started to have a panic attack and I went pale and I thought I was having a seizure or dying. It’s happened a handful of times over the past two years but that was only for a few months after getting it done then I started to have a home barber for a year and the only time I got it was when I was anxious. But the past 5 times i haven’t had it and it felt great ! Usually I get a stiff neck aswell in a barbers chair. So I’m scared of sitting in the chair and having the cover over my neck. I need a haircut as my home barber has moved so I need to go into the same shop as I had my first panic attack in. I just want reassurance I won’t die and tips on how to battle it.

Anxiety,Never ending anxiety,"I’ve been experiencing some intense anxiety attacks recently. I’ve always dealt with anxiety, but recently it has been horrible. The worst part is sometimes I’m not even sure what is triggering the attack. I could be doing some menial task and all of a sudden I start to feel numb in my legs and arms. I zone out and my heart starts racing. It’ll go away for a few hours and then come back. Every morning I wake up earlier than I want to my heart racing. I’m not sure if I’m having dreams that are triggering my anxiety because often times I don’t remember my dreams (although when I do they are mostly dreams that trigger my anxiety). 

I feel lost. I’ve started reaching out to people because I was suffering in silence, but reaching out has made me a tad anxious too. I want to pretend none of this happening, but it’s becoming obvious that I can’t do that. I just wish I could normalize. I’ve always had my anxiety issues but it’s never been this bad and I fear it’s never going to end."
Anxiety,"Really losing it, no longer know what is real medically, and want us anxiety..","So was diagnosed with prostatitis, my only symptom was peeing loads. Got a slightly enlarged prostate. When I get anxious I also pee loads. So I don't know how much I'm imagining things or how much are real medical feelings.

It's ruining my life and I just don't know what to do"
Anxiety,Visual disturbances?,I’m not even sure what you’d call them. But I’ve had these things for a while but they come and go. Usually the more dissociated and anxious I am the worse they are. I’m not even really sure how to explain them but I will try. Basically I always have grainy or “staticky” vision. That part doesn’t bother me as much because it’s always there. But then I’ll have something that’s like a translucent spiraling hole in the middle of my field of view? The only thing I can relate it to is when you look at an optical illusion picture like the one that looks like it’s spiraling and then you look away and you see weird things. Also I’ll get random blinking white or blue lights. And if I look at something and look away there’s a white after image. Or I’ll look at something and look away and it’s as if whatever I was looking at is trailing away from it until I stop moving my eyes. Idk if any of this makes sense to anyone but it’s freaking me out and I just wondered if anyone deals with the same things or similar things. Im kind of thinking I should get an mri or ct scan or something.

I know I’m going to feel incredibly trapped once everyone is seated and the doors close. Situations like these are the worst for me because I feel like I’m trapped. Like I can’t physically leave, and if I do, it will be incredibly inappropriate and embarrassing. I already feel so nauseous, lightheaded, and shaky just thinking about it. I’d really appreciate some encouragement or positive ways of thinking."
Anxiety,Consistently Anxious over EVERYTHING,"This is my first post here, but I was just hoping to see if I could get some advice/insight about what’s going on as well as vent about my feelings. I’ve always suffered from social anxiety, nothing major though, I’ve always been able to handle it and push through it, but randomly one day about three or four weeks ago it feels like something just switched in my brain. I went from one day being able to handle it and now almost every day I am getting major anxiety over everything to the point where I almost make myself sick. 

I’m getting headaches every day now which is obviously no fun, I would say they are more like migraines to be honest and I just always feel on edge. Some days feel better for a bit and then something so slight can trigger it. I overthink every situation whether it’s in the future or something later in the day to the point of (like I mentioned earlier) I get sick. I feel embarrassed (for context I’ve always had stomach issues) but now I stress myself out over eating, what to eat, when to eat, using the washroom (especially if I have plans in the evening). 

I’ve tried changing to natural remedies such as meditation, learning more about spirituality, I’ve started taking CBD (I’ve been prescribed Prozac, I just haven’t started the prescription because I’m unsure) and I’ve been trying to improve my daily life. I’m starting to question if I maybe have GAD (General Anxiety Disorder)?

The only step I haven’t taken is reaching out to a therapist which I am going to do today. If anyone has any advice or insight that would be awesome, but if not, thank you for listening to me vent."
Anxiety,Anxiety and Distractions,"Does anyone else here use hobbies or other distractions to take you away from your own world and into somewhere else? 

For me, I use audio book or video games. Being immersed in a good story or video game takes me away from my anxiety for a small amount of time. Living in that world and being someone else who doesn't have debilitating anxiety makes me feel normal for a short amount of time. The only problem is, when the game or book ends going back into ""normal"" life. 

I do feel like listing to an audio book before bed helps keep my mind out of the anxiety loop that I tend to have each night. Just don't forget to set a sleep timer, else you'll start listening to the book and not remember where you left off!

What other distractions have you guys used that help keep your mind semi-free of anxiety?"
Anxiety,Sometimes you just need to lay on your bed and do nothing for three years.,
Anxiety,Went to the psychiatrist for the first time today.,"As someone who finds it super hard to share their feelings and talk about emotions I’m SO glad I finally went. I have been struggling for years now and it finally reached a peak last month and I couldn’t put off going to see someone anymore. I had an amazing Doctor who was so comprehensive and empathetic. After years of suspecting, today I finally confirmed I have GAD and will be starting treatment for it and also therapy. I know this is far from over, but I’m excited to start working towards improving my mental health. ❤️"
Anxiety,[UPDATE] I finally had an appointment with my GP today after being too anxious to phone for weeks.,"I made a post 2 weeks ago about how terrified I was to book an appointment to discuss my anxiety and depression. 

I know it's not much progress, but today I finally did it!! I was honest about everything, and so my doctor has put me back on the antidepressant (sertraline) I stopped taking in April. While it sucks that I have to take medication to manage my anxiety and depression, I'm glad that I've at least told someone that I'm struggling again.

I really hope it helps me."
Anxiety,Man I’m tired (tw: passive suicidal ideation),"Holy shit I’m tired. So my anxiety has been getting better. And it gets worse. And it gets better. But lately things have felt calm. I’m not as anxious anymore, but I don’t feel happy either. I just exist. This feeling or rather lack of it sucks. 

I wrote in a post that big things were happening. Turns out I have to wait til next week. It feels like everything around me is crumbling to pieces. 

I love my friends and family dearly, but I just really want to fade into oblivion right about now. To go to sleep and never wake up. To be hit on the head by a meteor from out of nowhere. To be diagnosed with a terminal illness. I want to run away from my life. I don’t want to be me anymore. 

Looking at it from an outsider’s perspective, I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to stop. So then where do these thoughts of death come from? Most likely I’ve unconsciously associated my identity with the pain I am going through. Thus, the quickest way to end the pain is to end “myself.” But unwilling to take action myself, I am left with nothing but to hope to end.

I’m tired. My head hurts. Everything hurts actually. Life sucks. I just want the pain to stop and for everything to be okay."
Anxiety,Music buddies?,"Hi everyone :)
Depression and Anxiety just keep dragging me down and it's getting quite hard to keep going everyday but music truly is a fantastic medicine for anyone

Kind regards✌"
Anxiety,I’m too scared to get my license or a job—I think my anxiety has become almost or actually debilitating. TW: Mention of Assault,"I, (f16), was diagnosed with anxiety two years ago, and developed social anxiety after half a year of quarantine and now I’m too scared to do anything with unfamiliar people in fear of being awkward, alone, etc. 

I also have been assaulted, and being alone with men (adult men specifically) is horrifying. 

But fear aside I want to do something with my life. I want to go get a job this year, and start driving but it’s so overwhelming and scary that I don’t leave my room most days. 

Anyone been in the same predicament and have any advice?"

Anxiety,Gym Anxiety,"I'm not sure if this is right place to put this but I'm going to try anyways.

I just spent an entire day trying to get myself to go to the gym. But I never actually ended up going. This happens to me almost every time I go, and it has gotten significantly worse after lockdown ended. I've even had panic attacks over it.

I'm 17, and I've been going to the gym since I was 13, so I have a good idea about what I'm doing. I also love working out, so that isn't the problem. And I know everyone says to just ""focus on yourself"" and ""no one is looking at, or judging you"", but I still can't get myself to go.

I'm just sharing to see if anyone has some advice, or similar feelings and experiences. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. :)"

Anxiety,In a spiral,Hi all. The past few days I feel like I'm caught in a spiral. I have a food anxiety/ worry about throwing up and the past few days it's been kicked into overdrive. I've been eating what I can but the hungry feeling/nauseous feeling keeps setting off my anxiety. I'm just looking for some support or tips to break the anxiety cycle when going to eat.

Anxiety,How do I get over feeling like a burden to my friends?,"How do you get over fear of being a burden to your friends? I was invited, I want to go. They say they honestly want me around.

Anxiety,I'm always been worried about bad breath and how it never seems to go away.,"If there's two types insults that get to me the most, it's that I have low intelligence and that I smell bad. 

I have gotten better about my dental hygiene and trying to fix the bad breath issues I do have. But it never seems to go away. Even 30 minutes after brushing, my breath goes back to being awful. 

I'm extremely insecure about this especially considering how I've gotten bad breath complaints from both friends and family. When it's going on, I just want to hide from everyone and have a complete  ""Don't look at me"" attitude. Thankfully,  I've got a mask to protect others from it. But not from myself. It's truly a degrading thing to have."
Anxiety,Feeling Low,"Lately, I've been feeling unaccomplished and lazy lately. In other words, I've been feeling like a loser and beating myself up. Although covid made everything worse, I already had anxiety attacks randomly and now it's just a constant feeling that I'm not doing enough. I've been in the same routine for a while and I've not been trying to improve things. For instance,  can't tackle the clutter in my garage because it's too overwhelming to find a place for everything. Also, had many bad jobs,  am comfortable in my not so great job and I know I could be making more money elsewhere. School funding went away before I got my associates,  now I'm too mixed up with what to do to want to go back. My life is a mess, help"

Doctor is not calling me back until Friday. Kind of thought side effects would have subsided a little bit by now??

Was they this bad for anybody else? It's making it kind of hard to parent 🤢 thinking of just stopping them. . Nothing is worth this ☹️☹️☹️"

Anxiety,Absolutely terrified of handing in my notice!,"Hey guys! I'm in the UK, I have severe anxiety (which I hide well enough) and have been working part-time in a shop since October, after I finished my undergrad last summer. It was always the plan to do something temporary this year, as I'm starting my masters in September. I'm working part-time 1) for health/personal reasons and 2) to take a break and because of everything going on with COVID. They don't know I'm planning to go.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I plan to leave in August, so have to give a month's notice soon. I'm absolutely terrified of handing it in. My managers absolutely suck, they are so belittling and and I don't think I've ever had an open, relaxed conversation with any of them. I've called in sick one time in the last 9 months which I later explained was because of fear that I had COVID symptoms, and they basically didn't care at all (""well, you don't have symptoms, do you?"") and told me they expected me to be in. The air was never cleared and I never trusted them after that. I almost left then and there but I needed the money. The environment is gossipy and catty, and I've felt like I've had to tell white lies about my life to everyone because there's no way I can just \~be myself\~. And it's not just me; everyone agrees the management is awful.

&amp;#x200B;

I know five (!) other people who will have left between now and September for various reasons, so I logically know my leaving is really going to mean next to nothing. However, because of our strained relationship and the fact they have no inclination that I'm going back to uni at all, the thought of initiating that conversation is making me extremely nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a slightly more casual relationship with my assistant manager, so I'd prefer going to her on a day where my manager isn't in. Or I could just leave the manager a letter. Idk. No matter what, the whole thing just makes me feel sick. How do I do it?"
Anxiety,Gagging Caused by anxiety (anyone else get this or know what causes it?),"So I will try to keep this short and right to the point. When I get anxious I feel like I'm going to gag almost right away like the second anxiety comes on. My question to the smart people out there is what is causing that symptom is it really just as simple as ""oh you have a hyperactive gag reflex"" or is it a bit more scientific then that...as in is the anxiety causing instant throat spams such as cricopharangyteal spasms? because this gagging doesnt happen for everyone who has anxiety so there has to be some sort of underlying cause its def not normal. I went to an ENT who said nothing was wrong with my throat but I know that throat spasms can be missed cause soemtimes they wont occur when there doing endoscopys. Really just looking for guidance, is there any freakin way I can get rid of this symptom cause honestly I can deal with the pit in stomach and heart palputations but I can't deal with this gagging.

also anyone else have this and would like to share there experiences? I've had this for 15 years."
Anxiety,Anxiety in the shower,"Does anyone else get really anxious in the shower? 

I feel like I have claustrophobia because every time I go in the shower I feel like I have no air and it means that I start to have panic attacks. 

I also get scared I am going to slip on the floor and hurt my head or something. 

I have tried a few techniques, such as opening the door and drinking water but nothing seems to help. :(

It is so hard because this means that I actually dread washing and therefore I don't wash my hair and body enough. 

The same applies to the bath as well."
Anxiety,Scared off taking the vaccine,"I'm taking the vaccine tomorrow, and I'm so scared and anxious. I'm dreading the side effects cuz I know my anxiety will freak out over even the smallest thing and give me a panic attack.

Anxiety,How did you get prescribed 2mg bars of Xanax? Is your anxiety that crippling?,"It’s from my understanding that most psychiatrists usually start at .25-.5mg of Xanax for anxiety as a therapeutic dose. I’ve read that a lot of doctors steer away from prescribing 1-2mg due to the benzo being highly addictive and abused. 

When I was in the hospital in December due to crisis, they started me off with .5 Ativans for anxiety but that was way too short acting. The psychiatrist then tried Xanax .25 &amp; .5 which worked for a little but I still got anxiety once it wore off and honestly, I didn’t really feel anything from it. The next benzo I was prescribed was 5mg of Valium which seemed to work for me. It wasn’t too strong where I was dysfunctional, didn’t make me tired, but somehow relieved my anxiety and panic attacks.

Now my question is to those of you who are prescribed 2mg Xanax a day (sometimes x3 a day from what I read), how did you get your doctor to prescribe you that high of a dose? Is your anxiety that bad? I can imagine it was hard to do as many doctors are “safe” and will only want to prescribe .5mg of Xanax as the maximum from personal experience and reading up online."
Anxiety,"Burning, irritated skin for months"," 

For a few months now, I have been experiencing a sensation that feels like sunburn in certain parts of my body (tops of feet, buttocks, neck, face). The sensations come and go but they are there every day. My dermatologist ran blood tests and can't find anything wrong.

Often there is no visible sign, but sometimes there is some blotchy redness. It's causing me a lot of distress - it's uncomfortable to walk or sit sometimes, and other times my feet burn so much I can't get to sleep at night.

It's also contributing to my health anxiety because I keep wondering if it means MS or something, or just that it will never get resolved.

Has anyone else had this with anxiety?"
Anxiety,I feel like I’m drifting from my family,"I have generalised anxiety disorder and lately it’s been getting worse and I’ve been feeling really down and just terrible. Most of the time I spend my days and nights in my room alone and I don’t really want to talk or socialise with my family. When I do talk and socialise with my family I feel like I’m getting annoyed and irritated and I feel so bad about it because and I feel like I’m drifting from my mum and we were so close. I feel like the only time I’m “okay” is when I’m with my boyfriend and that makes me feel guilty because like why can’t I socialise and be okay around my family? They are not a bad family at all we get along. I don’t know if it’s because my boyfriend knows that I’m struggling and I tell him all about it? I don’t tell my family. 
Is this because of my anxiety? I just feel like a terrible person."

Anxiety,Probably gonna delete this but needed to vent about something that’s been stressing me,"I expressed my anxiety to my closest friend who knows I have anxiety and issues and I’m response, they took 6 days to “just do there own thing and not feel guilty”. They came back and I was honest about how the distance and about radio silence accompanied with them doing a private chat that excluded me from the friend group hurt my feelings. In response they’re telling me the way I felt has made the feel like a shitty person and they are ghosting me again. I hate this so much and I just want it to stop. I hate feeling punished for being honest with my best friend."

I've already got like 100 songs, but I want to make the playlist really big so that I don't end up listening to the same songs over and over and get bored lol. I'm down for most genres; pop, rock, punk, country, etc. So long as it's upbeat and has happy lyrics. I've been looking at ""happy"" playlists on Spotify and a lot of the songs are upbeat, but don't specifically have happy lyrics.

Anxiety,Does anybody feel like this sometimes?,"So first of all I'm on 40mg of paxil and 0.25mg of xanax in the morning and 0.5 in the evening.

No blood anywhere. Why is this ? I’m really worried now this is the worst case scenario. What could it be?

I must add that the doctor hasn’t requested to see me for an appointment (usually sign it’s serious) they just wanted me to have a repeat test in a month."
Anxiety,My anxiety has gotten so bad (TW: Death),"My anxiety has gotten so bad. I freak out when anyone mentions death. I had to go to a funeral and I panicked the whole time. I walked out of the theatre during Big Hero Six because baymax died. I can’t watch dog movies or movies with themes of death. 

Beginning of Covid was scary and hard for me because I felt like I would die. Stupid me thought it would be okay to look up “is there life after death?” And read the stories. Since I was losing my hope and faith. 

I’ve been having a panic attack from reading ONE story for the past 15 minutes. I hate my anxiety and I wish I could get it under control, but I doubt that it is possible now. 

Sure that wasn’t smart on my part, but I have just been having a hard time."

Anxiety,Intense anxiety before even waking up?,"Hi,

Recently ive been getting really intense anxiety in the moments when im waking up. Before I even open my eyes I feel that anxiety in my chest and my heart is pounding. It usually happens when bad things take place in my life. The thing is, there is literally nothing that can remove me from the situation I just need a way to deal with the anxiety. It makes me feel tired and sick."
Anxiety,Anyone here experience Adult separation anxiety?,"Separation anxiety has been something I (21M) struggled with ever since I was a  child (11+). It would manifest itself in intense feelings of dread, panic, and nausea every time I’d have to go back to school following a lengthy vacation period - so after Christmas, Easter, and Summer mainly. This made being away from home and from my mum for a couple of days quite literally unbearable.

Over the years those feelings subsided and became pretty much non existent - that is, until the past year or so.

My separation anxiety (from my girlfriend, friends, and family) has been flaring up this past week as I’ve started a new job. I was almost in tears on my first day and was having what felt like an hours long anxiety attack. I met my girlfriend in the evening and that helped, however I’m back at work and I can feel those feelings creeping back up and I’m terrified.

I don’t know how I can get through the week feeling like this.

Any suggestions?"

Anxiety,Has anybody taken propranolol?,"I (27 /f) was given it by my nurse practitioner yesterday when I told her I was having a hard time some days. I’m waiting for some CBT to help but to tide me over she said to take one 40mg a day.

Has anybody taken any? Any bad side effects does it make you sick? 
She told me if i’m having hard days i can take up to three but i forgot to ask if it was spread out through the day. At the moment she told me one in the morning.

I will have a wisdom tooth out next month so i’ll probably have anxiety attacks leading up to that"
Anxiety,I’m due to start a new job soon and my anxiety is in overdrive,"Hey everyone!

I was in the same job for 10 years, but was then made redundant, so it really has pushed me out of my comfort zone. I will also be changing sector, I worked as a manager in retail and I will now be a payroll assistant working in an office.

I’m scared that they’ll think I’m just too incompetent for the role, I’m scared I won’t understand what I’m doing and that I will mess up and the place I’m working is so large that I’m scared of getting completely lost. The company has 6000 members of staff, obviously I won’t be doing the payroll for all of these people, but the sheer size of the company just scares me. It knocks me so sick to imagine being told something and not being able to understand in the slightest.

I feel like I am now in standby mode until I start, it’s like no other tasks can get done until I start work. Does anyone else just feel like they can’t do anything else when they are waiting for a particular date or meeting? I know that sounds silly, but I am really starting to struggle this week.

I was hoping for some general advice please. I have looked online to try and get a better understanding of my job, to try and ease myself, but can’t really find anything.

Thank you"
Anxiety,Had a panic attack as I took my first Fluoxetine 😭😭,"So I was prescribed 20mg fluoxetine for the 1st month and then up to 40mg from there on. As well as alzam (xanax) in case of anxiety flare ups. 

I was supposed to start yesterday but I just couldn't take the pill. I cried and was riddled with stress  my stomach was in knots. This morning I felt nauseous and sick all because I knew I had to take it today. I took it at about 10am and it felt like I had an immediate panic attack. And now I'm 2 hours in and I just don't feel right, my head feels fuzzy. I'm almost certain its the anxiety doing this and not the actual pill . 

I'd love to get some stories of how it was for you the first day , and days to follow. I think it will calm me down to know im not alone.  I'm so scared 😭😭😭😭😭 

Thank you 🌸🌸🌸"

Anxiety,I had a small a-ha moment this morning. Hope it helps somenbody.,"I dont think I'm alone when saying I look for total, uncompromised freedom from anxiety. Some magic wand will show up one day and whoosh it all away. But I realised this morning, that there is no final end to negativity and triggers in life. We can only get better at dealing with it.  

Ironically there was a peace in realising I will never be 100% free. Acceptance I guess. But the peace came from realising I CAN get stronger every day until I have some control over it rather than it having total control over me.

Also, loosing the despondency of 'not winning today'. The smallest steps make tomorrow that much better. And the next day. There is no next day delivery on this. Anxiety doesn't bow culture of immediacy. 

Stay the course. Weather every storm. And learn"
Anxiety,Fingers Crossed for medication/CBT combination treatment?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is relevant to post here - I've suffered with anxiety on and off my whole life, but in the past 1.5/2 years it has steadily got worse and worse. I went through a highly traumatic situation about 2 years ago and despite going to counselling to try and overcome it, there was obviously deeper rooted issues that were festering in the background. 

Around 2 months ago it had gotten so bad that I was physically ill &amp; couldn't keep any food down, resulting in unhealthy weight loss and having no energy. Because I was throwing up multiple times a day, I couldn't go to work/leave my house/do anything except lie in bed, starving. This then progressed to being completely unable to sleep, which presumably played on my brain because I started having horrific night terrors every night to the extent that I was then \*afraid\* to try and sleep. I'm a 26 year old woman and I repeatedly had to go into my mom in the middle of the night in floods of tears, to ask if I could sleep in her bed. The lack of sleep eventually resulted in me actually believing there was something in my room that was watching me &amp; waiting for me to sleep and I couldn't so much as close my eyes without feeling a panic attack coming on. If I did manage to sleep I'd either wake up screaming or \*feeling\* like I was screaming, from trying to wake myself up to get out of the dream.

Eventually I really felt I was on the verge of some sort of mental breakdown - my brain wasn't functioning at all, I was having awful intrusive thoughts all day everyday, and the anxiety was the only thing that I could focus on. Thankfully I had the sense to finally go to the doctor and I just sat in this lovely doctor's office for an hour crying and spilling out a mess of what was wrong with me. Fair play to her for being able to make sense of any of it because I think it was just a jumble of feelings and tears.

After a few tests/health checks &amp; a lot of discussion on what the best course of action would be, she prescribed anti-depressants that are also meant to help combat anxiety, to try and stabilize me and at the very least fix the sleeping pattern so everything else isn't so impossible to deal with. Feeling a  little more stable in that sense now, I'm due to start cognitive behavioral therapy with a psychiatrist she referred me to and honestly I am so hopeful. I've done a lot of research online and I feel like it could really be helpful, as I just have gone so long now without being able to cope with anything in my life at all. I just bury my head in the sand and hope it will go away and I presume this is what has brought me to the situation I'm in now. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone down the medication teamed with CBT route here and how did you find it helped? I know they say you get out what you put in; I just have a good feeling because for the first time in years I feel like I'm doing something that will let me live my life and stop hiding in fear. I feel like I've wasted so much time and missed out on so much, and this could be the first step to ending the cycle. 

Thanks all &lt;3"
Anxiety,"There is a real bad windy storm outside tonight and it is spiking my anxiety; the noise, the shaking of the house, the rattling of the windows, the shrill of it, and already knowing I am not going to be able to sleep so will have a bad day at work tomorrow.","I can feel my heart pounding, my breath quickening and being hyper aware of everything. I am so exhausted mentally and physict but nothing is going to get through tonight. I know I am going to be waking up all night, and when I do sleep I will dream of my teeth falling out, or driving a car without working brakes. So much of my anxiety I have learnt to control and manage but the weather isn't something I can control, plan for, or change the situation of.

Anxiety,Does anyone else pick at their skin?,"I think it is anxiety related but I have been doing it for at least a decade. It started when I got pimples, I started fidgeting with it till it bled. I continuously have scabs and wounds on my body, mostly on my face.

I have tried to stop this and sometimes it works, but I keep starting it up again. I also tend to pick at any wounds and unevenness all over my body. Anyone know how to stop?"

Anxiety,What is the ‘perfect diet’,Hi guys I hope you are all okay ! I had some blood tests done and everything came back fine except my liver function so I have to go back to get a repeat test in 4 weeks. I imagine this is most likely because of an anomaly ! Nothing serious ! I do have a doctors appointment tomorrow so I will know more. Anyway I want to in this month go on a perfect diet to make my liver function fine again. My diet at the minute is just takeaways and snacks. No nutritional value at all! Could somebody give me advice on what the perfect diet looks like or websites that show you? I have looked around but they are all adverts for stuff.
Anxiety,Anyone had a low key wedding?,"So talking about getting married, and I've never really wanted to because I don't think I could physically get through a whole ceremony. But it means a lot to my partner, so I'm willing to get married for her. Even going to other people's weddings are awful, I sit there shaking and panicking that I'm going faint. It's the weird silent pressurised atmosphere that's awful. And I have food anxiety too, so then sitting through a meal is hell! 

Just wanted to ask if anyone had a low key wedding limited by similar anxieties. I'm in no way religious, so the wackier ideas the better haha thinking maybe we should do it at a cat cafe 😂"
Anxiety,(TW: mention of death) severe anxiety around what will happen,"(TW: mention of death) yall... it's getting pretty bad i can't even eat or go about daily life without being scared about what will happen. even when I look at someone I just automatically think about how many years I have left and I always get scared about the sensations and not seeing my parents ever again and just the whole shebang surrounding what it is like to die.  idk why I'm like this and I just want it to stop, I keep on convincing myself everything will be okay but it won't because we will all die and I can never change that and that makes me feel super hopeless... any advice on how to deal with these anxiety is appreciated"
Anxiety,Things about anxiety that no one ever talks about...,"Hello,

Since anxiety has become “main stream”, i’ve noticed all the things that they don’t talk about on social media and tv that we have to go through every day.

I’ve taken the time to make this list of anxiety symptoms and things that no one ever talks about. I have no doubt that this list will make you say “me”.

Im really sharing because i’d love your help to make this list better and i’ve spent so much time on it.

It would be great if you could put a comment on this article with any symptoms or things i’ve missed that you deal with or anything that really hits home for you.

Thank you!!
 
[19 Anxiety Things No One Ever Talks About](https://karmara.co.uk/blogs/learn/19-anxiety-symptoms)"
Anxiety,My healing process,"I would like to share my routine for healing from anxiety totally. English is not my native language, so i can make faults.

 I had massive anxiety that ruined my life. I was agitated 7/24 and i couldnt have one normal conversation with people. I've become unable to do normal things. Even eating, toilet and shower was hell for me. And i couldnt have good sleep for months. Now i am %80 better. I have a long history with medications and doctors. I stop using medications like 2 year before i started this routine.

 I didnt use and medication in this period and i dont recommend you to stop using it. This is not proven scientificly, so do not ask me my sources. I tried and it worked for me, you can try and see if it will work. 

 1. I tried to give my body rest. I did intermittent fasting with 2 meals, 16/8,  sometimes with 1 snack between. I overchewed the food to the point it becames liquid(Important). I did this for help my digestion. You can change to 3 meals a day after sometime. But i think you should wait minimum 4 hours for another meal. I dont reccoment snack if you eat 3 or 3+ meals a day. Try to make your body comfortable.

I dont need to talk about sleep. You know. If you wake up fatigue after all the things you tried, check sleep apnea.

2. Streching is mandatory. 10 minutes everyday. . If you can, i recommend lifting weights. But dont stop streching.

3. Do not take your phone with you when you go to toilet or shower. 

4. Most important one. No music. Do not use your earphones. At all. 

I recommend you not to listen music at all for 3-4 days. Then start listening 1 hours a day, just do not listen all the time. Give your mind rest. I give myself from 30 minutes to 1 hours at nights for listening. """"And when you listen, do not use earphones."""" Sometimes, i dont listen at all. My goal is to not allowing random words, melodies, informations etc. to enter my mind 7/24. When i listen music, i dont open random playlist and let it fill my mind. I know exacly what i will listen. The genre, informations etc. No depressive music.

5. I dont let all the information to enter my mind. Same with music, i just dont enter instagram or twitter or facebook and starting reading random things, seeing random photos, random information all the time. I think and decide what i want to enter my mind, then i do that thing.

I dont recommend you to use social media. First 3-4 days at all. Then, post a photo or look for the photos your friends posted and leave. Do not lose yourself in random informations. I dont recommend you to follow pages. If there is pages you really like, keep following them and unfollow the rest. You can check this pages when you want. Just do not look this pages when you randomly surfing on instagram,twitter etc. You will open the page when you want.

6. I dont meditate because my routines is like meditating all the time. When you dont listen music and lose yourself in random informations, your mind is almost clear all the time. If you like, im sure it will help you. You can meditate to. I think minimum 10 minutes will work.

 This is what i did for my anxiety and it cured it almost %80. This is not medical advice, do not stop using you medication.

 If you try and if it works for you, let me know."
Anxiety,Anxiety around everything,"Just no matter what I do , I get anxiety, whatever if I’m on social media on Reddit at home or not I end up having an attack. 
Ended up in a hospital today , I disappointing every one around me because I can’t do even basic stuff like driving, I can’t date,I can’t do anything, I’m fucking useless , I feel like every thing I do just make things worse , I don’t want to be this way,yet no matter how hard I try,nothing changes . 

Is this even anxiety or something else?"
Anxiety,Fear of my chats/pics getting leaked,"Some years ago I did sexting with a girl, turned out he was a guy undercover and he threatened to send them to a girl I knew. I don't know if he did and I don't care anymore, but now I got this fear that my chats/photos could be leaked and sent to my friends by girls I chat with, and because of this fear I'm always quite scared to talk about private topics that I wouldn't want to be shared to others. Am I being anxious for something unrealistic? What should I do about it?"
Anxiety,Extreme feeling of guilt when saying “no”,"Basically the title says it.

I’ve always had this problem. I can’t say “no” when someone asks me for a favour, even if it requires me to go out of my way and cause stress to myself. Especially at work. 

I’ve “got myself” into working overtime numerous times, doing tasks, which are not my responsibility, taking other people’s tasks, because they can’t complete them on time, etc. 

As I said, I’ve always been like this, but the problem became so much worse at my first job, which I started about an year ago. The working environment was really toxic. Every time I would try to say something and defend myself against working overtime for nth day in a row, I was said something in the lines of “oh, but we’ve done so much for you, don’t you remember that time 3 months ago when you got stomach ache and we let you go home earlier?”. I ended up quitting, after enduring months of being treated terribly. 

This led to me feeling extremely anxious when I have to say “no” about something, and I feel very guilty about it - like I have disappointed that person in some way and like I’m an unreliable person. I recently started a new job and I already have the same feeling. 

How do I deal with this? It’s really exhausting."
Anxiety,anxious about what i’ve done to my body,"ive smoked around 35-40 cigs in my life and vaped a lot and i just was watching real life stories about those who’ve smoked and how they cancer at like 35 etc and now i’m freaking out. i’m a 19 year old and don’t want my life to be over because of cancer i’m so scared :( 

I stopped smoking and vaping but i’m just still so so so scared"
Anxiety,My anxiety got worse and I feel like I'm going to explode (TW),"
TW: intrusive thoughts, suicidal thoughts, selfharm

Hello, I'm first time poster so I hope my post is alright. I'm on my mobile so sorry for the formatting and also I'm not a native English speaker so sorry for any mistakes. 

I'm F 24, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression a few years ago, I was going to the psychiatrist but stopped after 2 years because she decided I hadn't needed help anymore. 

In the last few months my anxiety got worse. It has gotten to a point I think I'm gonna pass out during the attacks, I'm weak and I can barely stand. My hands and fingers curls and I clench my fists so bad that my nails cut into palms. I also puke sometimes. My thoughts run through my head, I zone out and I want to dissapear. I have a lot of sucidal thoughts, I just want to end it all. I scratch my face, my arms, neck but it's like I don't completely control myself in that times.

I'm worried because I have panic attacks almost every day and I've gotten suicidal because I just can't stand this and life in general anymore.

I found out that my triggers are when I think people are going to leave me, when I feel like they're tired of me and when I feel like they don't care about me (especially my boyfriend) - and I feel like that almost every second of the day. I'm also anxious about future, this pandemic, my job and the fact that I'm getting older.

I'm so tired and I know we all are. I just feel so alone because nobody understands. I tried explaining it to my boyfriend but he doesn't know what to do. My friends have other problems and I feel like they don't care.

I have run out of the ideas what I should do."
Anxiety,"Intrusive thoughts, thinking or ignoring?","Hi, I hope this post belongs here,

recently i've been in lockdown (in australia) and as ive been quite bored with nothing to do, intrusive thoughts and anxiety have been really severe recently. Throw in a relationship breakdown a few months ago i cant seem to move on from, and a career fork in the road, and its just been really mentally draining.

My question is not for strategies to move on, get help - i know what to do but i cant do anything right now stuck inside, so more about cognitive reframing and the choices i can make.

When i get intrusive thoughts, do i brush them off/laugh them off or do i embrace them, sit down and think them out until im desensitised to them? I've tried both but i dont want to commit to either until i know what it will achieve. I've had this problem in the past years ago and i've moved on from it and stopped having such constant intrusive thoughts, but this time i cant see an easy way out."
Anxiety,Terrifing anxiety about vaccine,"I registered myself to get the vaccine but since then i started have bad intrusive thoughts and ossessively researching info about side effects of the vaccine so it's become a vicious circle of bad anxiety and i am thinking of just not going for now, i am. scared i will go crazy tbh if i got the vaccine."
Anxiety,"Feeling Negative Due to my Friend, suggestions?","I am so annoyed at my friend I am not sure if there is any real friendship left. He has mental issues, drug issues. He has been a friend since high school. Known him 15 years nearly. He lost him mom and lost the plot ever since. He comes and goes, changes his phone a lot, etc. Anyway, he takes things like crack cocaine, lost most his teeth, blah blah.

He has a kind side to him, he has done kind things to me in the past, like he had a lump sum and even purchased things for my car some years ago. He will buy me a coffee if he has money (which isn’t often as he spends it impulsively when he has it), I’ll treat him also.

However, although he is homeless and has been put up in hotels, I know he likes to take drugs. He asks me at times (Can I lend £20 for \*excuse\*, I am sure it is because he is desperate for a drug). However, I also know he is homeless and is been put up on hotels, and then often eventually kicked out for one reason or another – Zzzz.

So recently I did lend him £20 and he said he would give it back the next day and pay it in my account. Of course, I am not naïve and so I didn’t expect it for sometime. However, 5 weeks on he hasn’t been in touch other than once again he sent a text saying he was on the street. I just ignored that and said he still owes me £20 and had not been in touch. He rarely goes on Facebook, but I messaged him to say when does he want to meet up and has, he got the £20 and had they found him a place to live. He eventually logged on the other day and did see it but didn’t reply. AHHHH!!? His crazy partner, who fancies me, and is jealous of me as I got house, business, car, etc. She asked how I was, which was nice. I did then ask if they’d found a new place from the government, but she didn’t reply to that. Confused?!?

I do not got other mates (my job makes it near impossible, and I got anxiety and can't make new friends), It annoys me so much. What should I do? I feel like telling him to go away, but that would be a bad move I think ☹I am not in his situation with no home and drug addiction… so ideas people? It is playing on my mind and putting me in a seriously negative mood – friends are supposed to meet up somewhat regular, not be ignored for 5 weeks!"
Anxiety,New to anxiety,"I’m relatively new to constant anxiety. I’ve had depression most of my life, and it was being treated successfully with an antidepressant. 
But since getting COVID late 2020, and then transferring to a new unit (and how work treated me around that), then getting hit by a patient and getting a concussion - I’ve not been right. 
I have constant anxiety, like what I experienced intermittently at nursing school, but constant. I used to be a “people person”, but now I get so nervous meeting new people. And this past weekend, the fireworks just sent me over the edge. I went to a party a friend was having. Pretty big party. I usually help, and then schmooze with the people I don’t know, and then help with the fireworks. 
This time, I had to leave the party to get away from everything. And then when it was time for the fireworks, I was walking over to help, then just noped out of there and could barely watch them from inside and the noise set me on edge like never before. 
It is painful being this person I am right now."
Anxiety,Chest Pain,"Hey all, so I suffer from panic attacks. I’ve recently had to up my Celexa from 15mg to 20mg. I’ve noticed that I was having chest pains. At first it was like a burning sensation in the middle of my chest that I noticed happened when I moved. Fast forward a few days and it’s still hurting, but feels like sore I guess? Like if you were to workout and how your muscles feel sore? Does anyone have experience with this? I’ve never had my anxiety manifest itself into chest pains. Also hurts when I wake up in the morning."
Anxiety,I don't feel scared when I should.,"I feel terrified about the stupidest things, but when a normal person would feel scared I feel nothing. 

There are a number of safe situations where a normal person would be irrationally scared. I don't feel anything. It can be useful, if concerning. 

But in life-threatening situations too, I don't feel scared. Adrenal action is working normally, but emotional response isn't. 

It seems like my fear system is completely broken. 

Does anyone else feel like this?"
Anxiety,I'm so exhausted from all the anxiety attacks,"I needed to vent somewhere safe and I found this sub here. I usually would describe myself as someone who's always on the edge. I'm going out with my friends? I get anxious even though it's supposed to be a relaxing situation and they make me feel safe and there's no judgement whatsoever. I'm always anxious and always stressing out. 

However, college elevates this to a whole new level. I'm in a fairly hard major and professors expect us to be studying 24/7, and I do obviously, but staring at my computer for hours and hours really starts stressing me out and I'm always grinding my teeth and shaking throughout the day from overthinking if everything is going to turn out fine. Lately, I've even been cutting my hair(constantly, the scissors are always somewhere near me) and scratching my head until it bleeds from how stressed out I am. Now, I usually get good grades and my hard work pays off for the most part but last semester, I failed my first class. I knew I'd fail because during the exam, I started panicking and forgot everything I had been studying for the entire semester. I took it again this semester, and I actually just finished its exam about 2 hours ago, I thought I did pretty good and I was definitely passing this time. My friend called me an hour ago and tells me he had trouble on one question and suddenly I get an anxiety attack. What if I did not answer anything right on the exam and fail again? My heart started pounding, I lost control of my body and it felt like I was about to pass out. This is a common thing that's been happening this semester unfortunately. Almost every night since April has been like this for me. I get an anxiety attack, and it feels like the entire world is spinning and I'm gonna faint. I also have a feeling I might fail another class again and it's keeping me from sleeping well at night. I don't wanna drop out because I love this major so much and it's the only thing that I wanna do but my mental health is deteriorating and I'm just tired. I don't even think my grades are gonna come out until August and I don't know if I can go a whole month with nightly anxiety attacks. Sometimes I just wanna tell my parents what I feel, or that I failed a class, but I'm scared of telling them and I don't even know why. I wanna say I want someone to hug me and tell me it's okay but honestly I always feel like it just leaves me more alone. Yes, you hugged me and you care for me, but at the end, it's me and my thoughts again."
Anxiety,Research has shown that certain foods can help mitigate the symptoms of anxiety.,"These include: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Probiotic foods such as kefir, sauerkraut, and pickles
* Fatty fish including salmon, sardines, trout, and herring
* Pumpkin Seeds
* Eggs
* Brazil Nuts
* Dark Chocolate

Anxiety,CBD instead of Xanax?,"Have any of you tried CBD (flower, not oil) to ease anxiety? I've been noticing lately that I take Xanax a bit too often whenever I feel anxious and when I go to sleep.
I saw a store which sells CBD buds and I ordered some, since I've heard good things about it - atleast it's worth a try. Have any of you had experiences trying to use CBD instead of benzos?"
Anxiety,Relapse :(,[removed]
Anxiety,SSRI Sexual Dysfunction Question,"Hi all,

I'm taking Lexapro along with Lyrica and Klonopin for severe panic disorder with agoraphobia and GAD. The disorders are under control but I have been suffering from sexual dysfunction for what seems like forever now and my doctor and I have tried various SSRIs/SNRIs/serotonin modulators, etc., to no avail because I need a high dose (currently taking 20mg of Lexapro) to keep the disorders at bay.

The usual antidote is Wellbutrin or some other stimulating drug but I can't take those because, well, I suffer from very severe panic disorder with agoraphobia. 

I'm in my mid-30s, male, (I'm fit, if that makes any difference) and suffering from complete lack of libido and anorgasmia/anejaculation along with genital anesthesia to a large extent. This is extremely depressing as it has a tremendous impact on my quality of life and of course my dating life -- I'm single for obvious reasons. 

My doctor is out of ideas, but perhaps one of you who is in a similar situation has found something that works and can provide feedback/suggestions. 

Thanks, everyone."
Anxiety,Why do I get this heavy feeling in my chest when I get nervous?,"Is it really anxiety? I'm 15 and I didn't have this back then. I'm pretty sure it started when online classes started, I was nervous because I thought that I'll be having missing assignments. Though I'm glad I did not throughout the school year. I was 14 that time, I turned 15 this May.

But that aside, I really need advice on what to do. I get this heavy feeling on my chest everytime I somehow get nervous or when I'm getting impatient. 

Listening to music kinda makes my mind calm, but not my chest."
Anxiety,Control (thoughts this morning and TW suicide attempt),"I have an anxiety disorder and so far this year has been bad on that front. Before the pandemic it was kinda under control and I was getting so much better. 

The last few weeks/months, I struggled more than I did the last 6-7 years. 

I thought I could will myself out of it. I thought booking a vacation for the end of July with my partner would fix it. That the summer would bring back my courage and ability to recover from my anxiety attacks. 

Well it did not. What is starting to do it is to let my need of being in control of my disorder and how it express itself in my life (work, relationship, friendships and family). I let my therapist offer things and I'm willing to try them. I told my work that I needed to have my hours reduced until my vacation, I told them I am struggling and admitting that was such a relief. 

So, this morning I was feeling kinda positive and thought, again, that I could will myself into being okay all day. 

And then my mother wrote me to tell me my little sister (11 years old) is in the hospital because she attempted suicide. 

Like my father before, my mother and myself. My family should have a membership to the mental health emergency room at this point. 

Well, my day won't be easy and I probably won't be able to recover from that and go back to the good mood I had when I woke up. 

It isn't my fault that I didn't succeed in being happy and calm today, and I need to repeat it until I believe it. 

I can't control what the world will throw my way. 

I will take care of me and my family today and accept that it is a bad day and hope that tomorrow will be better."
Anxiety,"Anyone else ever have a slight bit of air stuck in abdomen and instantly think it’s your appendix, liver, kidneys, etc.","It’s always the first thing that pops into my mind. Right now it’s appendicitis, since it’s on my right side. As I’m writing this it’s gotten slightly better but still hurts every few minutes, and even then it’s only slight pain. Just wondering if anyone else gets like this lol."
Anxiety,Dealing with health anxiety,"Does anyone have advice for someone with pretty bad health anxiety? For context, whenever I notice any potential symptom I obssess about it to the point where it gets worse and I start to believe that I must have a serious disease and will die, sometimes even panicking and feeling faint. 
This is particularly bad in relation to heart problems: Never been diagnosed with one, but have been to the emergency more than once believing I was having a heart attack or some other dangerous disease, and even while explaining to the doctor I was shaking and really expecting the worst. Now, I've been frequently feeling spasms in my chest and I'm really worried about coronary artery disease or something like that. I realize it's irrational, but I'm terrified of being diagnosed with some heart condition even if it's treatable, I'm scared it will cause me to die early or something, I'm only 20. It'd surely be worth it to check what's going on but this fear prevents me from seeking medical attention, does anyone relate? How could I deal with it?"
Anxiety,Self Confidence At Peak yet Still Paranoid/Anxious,"Hello,

I've always been a confident person but for the last 6 months I'm having serious anxiety attacks related to my social life even though I'm a confident person. The attacks make me overthink about my relationships and makes me feel like I'm nothing but a worthless human being to everyone that knows me.

Is it just me or is it a common thing?

Regards"
Anxiety,I constantly have to be worried,"Whenenver theres nothing for me to worry about, my brain usually finds something to worry about. I could be having a great day, but once I realize Im not worrying BAM! I feel uneasy, and anxious, because surely I must have to worry about something and usually I end up worrying about something that is either out of my control or is truly not a big deal. Can anyone relate? This sucks!! :("
Anxiety,I just need a hug,"So I have anxiety over germs and therefore anxiety over touch and I don't like people touching me unless I've asked them or they've asked me first. So like my friend came up behind me and just hugged me the other day and I tensed up and felt really uncomfortable for the next like 10 minutes. But I've hugged her before and was fine. 

The one problem about hating contact is that I also love hugs and touch, but I hate germs. So right now, I just really want to sit down and hug my friends for like an hour, but I also dont want to come across as weird or give them the impression that I'm okay for hugs constantly (because I'm not). And my entire family is asleep right now so I can't ask them for a hug. So because I can't get that I've resorted to watching videos on cuddle therapy. 

I just really want a hug right now."
Anxiety,A Mess of Contradications,[removed]
Anxiety,Lexapro side effects,"My doctor has me on Gabapentin and lexapro for my anxiety. But I don’t feel any positive side effects from the Lexapro. Basically it’s just making me feel apathetic, and the anxiety is still there - my anger is worse both in terms of how quick it gets to max and how bad it gets. It’s interfering with my sex life, and I’m having some pretty bad nausea. 

He thought about switching me to Zoloft, but my sister felt the apathy from that as well. Has anybody tried both and had one work for them more?"
Anxiety,Does anyone have any tips for dealing with anxiety associated with Autism (ASD)?,"Since 2018, I've had worsening anxiety and I suspect that my ASD is a big contributing factor - Does anyone have any tips specific to our condition that may be able to help?

Anxiety,Pregabalin - does it only work occasionally for anyone else as well?,So I've been on Pregabalin for a month at 50mg and I split that dose during the day as it only has a short half-life however it doesn't always seem to work in reliving my anxiety - I'm just wondering if anyone else has found this? Am I on too low a dose?

Anxiety,"This is going to sound stupid, but I get really anxious when I see Linkedin.","I look at all the people on there from my university or people I kmow who get outstanding grades and do really well in their exams. It really puts my profile in perspective because im not as smart as them. I'm hardworking and I show a lot of interest but companies aren't interested. 

My biggest fear is not landing a job after all my schooling. I'm so terrified of that. I'm not built for pressure and that makes it worse. All those people who do something outstanding really threaten me when it comes to my own success."
Anxiety,I'm always been worried about bad breath and how it never seems to go away.,"If there are two types of insults that get to me the most, it's that I have low intelligence and that I smell bad.

I have gotten better about my dental hygiene and trying to fix the bad breath issues I do have. But it never seems to go away. Even 30 minutes after brushing, my breath goes back to being awful.

I'm extremely insecure about this especially considering how I've gotten bad breath complaints from both friends and family. When it's going on, I just want to hide from everyone and have a complete ""Don't look at me"" attitude. Thankfully, I've got a mask to protect others from it. But not from myself. It's truly a degrading thing to have."
Anxiety,Buspar?,I got prescribed buspar. I have generalized anxiety disorder and I also get anxious around groups of people. I deal with a lot of muscle tension and heart palpitations. I haven’t started taking it yet. The doctor told me to take it 3 times a day.. I was wondering if this helped anyone else.
Anxiety,Is this just my anxiety or is this weird?,"I had a friend visit from out of town recently and she stayed with me and my partner. My friend is very fond of my partner and while at first I found it endearing, this last visit it was weird. I found her competing with me to impress him, doing some of his idiosyncrasies, and just kind of dotting over him the whole visit. I talked to my partner about it briefly and he thought it was a little strange but I didn't push because I didn't want to come off as a jealous girlfriend (especially because I'm not). I can't tell if I'm just sensitive about the behavior because of anxiety (a different friend slept with an ex and lied about it to me) or if it's actually strange to other people, too."

Anxiety,My Little Little World,[removed]
Anxiety,I'm having serious separation anxiety and need help," Okay so 1 year ago, my sister died while she was abroad. Since then, I've been living with my parents the whole time (also because college was shut down due to covid). During this period, there was never a time when any of us ventured out of the town. I became closer to them.

But this week they are travelling to a church in the next state as my sister's B'Day's coming up and mom is a bit religious and she insisted. But I can't as I would be starting my internship. So I would be alone at my house for 4 days which is right smack dab in the middle of one of the hardest days for me.

I keep having these dark thoughts of anything bad that might happen to them. I can't seem to stop myself from letting go of the possible thought of becoming an orphan. This is bugging me so much. I have a bad case of separation anxiety as there have been cases in the last year where I had to resort to bodily harm.

My parents even offered to not go, but I realize this must stop. It cannot go on like this and also mom wanted badly to go. So in spite of keeping a smiling face, I'm screaming inside. Can't shake these horrible thoughts. Events leading to my sister's death keep popping up randomly thinking how the universe might repeat itself.

I need help. My financial conditions prevent me from keeping any therapist on the payroll. And also, the ones over here are horrible. So anyone please help me. This is a desperate cry. I can't seem to get any work done and this leads to me falling into the depression pit from which I worked so hard to recover from last year."
Anxiety,I just had a panic attack in my dream,"I just had a panick attack in my actual dream, then I woke up and I had a slight pain in my chest and some shortness of breathing, it felt as if I just had a panic attack. Was I actually having a panic attack in my sleep or is it just in a dream that felt so real?"
Anxiety,Random waves of dread when away from home?,"Does anyone else also get these? Apologies if this has been posted or asked before.

I find that it only happens when I'm in a foreign city or country, I'll be doing something and suddenly get hit with thoughts of 'I don't want to be here, I want to be at home in my own house' accompanied by a sinking feeling in my stomach and all of a sudden I won't want to leave the hotel room anymore, and I have to tell myself 'the vacation will be over before you know it and you'll be able to go home.'

I'm not really sure if this is connected to general anxiety or whether it's something experienced by a majority of people in the world..."

Anxiety,How do your headaches feel?,"Hello all! 
I’m wondering how your headaches are in regards to tension headaches or headaches related to your anxiety. Curious to know what others experience so I can get a better understanding of my own. TIA"
Anxiety,"Autism, pain &amp; insecurity","Ive been having a long-lasting antibiotic resistant uti and everytime the pain gets worse after another antibiotic that didn't work it triggers me and i fall back into another anxiety cycle.

The first week is always worst, im physically unable to do basically anything. I cant eat, drink, sleep or breathe and sometimes i cant even talk but as days go by it always improves as i start to trust my body again.

Yesterday it got triggered again and i had panic attacks all day long, i wanted to slit my wrists. But this time i called my therapy crisis line and we had a long talk about how autism needs security or else we go crazy. We'd rather hurt ourselves instead of be insecure. 

We made some points and how to deal with the anxiety, some extra medication and therapy and some ideas on what steps we can take to help me so i dont have to feel hopeless.

Right now im fairly calm again, im glad i took this step instead of hurting myself out of desperation."
Anxiety,GAD and weed as meds experience?,"My therapist wants me to go on medication for my chronic GAD, but I have already tried most of them and although they work perfectly for my anxiety, I react badly and have horrible side effects. In my state weed is legal and it helps with my anxiety, I am thinking of medicating my anxiety with weed, any of you do this? If yes, what is your routine and what form of weed do you use (oil, spray, edibles, vape?)"

Anxiety,What are the signs that I need to see a new therapist?,"I have an appt today but I'm not looking forward to it. I haven't felt like I've had progress &amp; I've had about 4 sessions. All I get are a bunch of questions asked to me as if she forgot what my problem was and keeps asking me what I do to help it. Then I get ""homework"" which is a daily mood log that actually for ""someone that's depressed"" she said. I have bad anxiety but I dont get depressed. Yet I have to feel out a daily mood log like I'm a child. I did a log last time and we did nothing with that paper next session.

What are some signs that I just need a better therapist? I dont want to assume shes bad just because I dont have progress."
Anxiety,My Starting Progress,"Hey all! Recently, I hit rock-bottom, and oh boy was it bad. I didn’t know how I was going to come out alive, honestly. I always used to run away from my anxiety, I just hated that feeling so much, but what helps (at least for me) is kind of understanding to make friends with it. I’m honestly just starting to do that, but it’s what makes us who we are, and I think we should try to embrace it if we can. To be overly sensitive, to be more self-aware than a lot of others, to be able to pull out a range of emotions: it’s a gift, and if we learn to get comfortable with that part of ourselves, the more opportunities we’ll have to use our gift and help others. 

When I was going through debilitating panic disorder caused by my severe OCD &amp; ADHD, I compiled many videos over time from YouTube of just other people sharing their experiences with anxiety and panic attacks. It really helps me when I feel a downward spiral about to happen, as I know I’m not alone, and I’m not going crazy.

Besides seeing a therapist as well, something that I’ve started practicing each day is a mantra or prayer, learning Buddhism, and meditation, which I think can all possibly help with anxiety (besides the obvious talking to people, etc.) There’s a book called Siddartha and several books from Eckhart Tolle that teaches how to be still. Also, just personally for me, both depression and anxiety were really kicking my ass, and I wasn’t taking care of my body and was isolating. I’ve noticed switching to a plant-based diet and taking some supplements (Joy-Filled, Vitamin D3) have really helped my episodes a lot. I never took nutrition seriously until now! Anyway, you can be doing everything I mentioned and I’m totally not saying these things will work for everyone, but in my situation, I can start to see improvement with these holistic approaches, so I just thought I’d share! Have a blessed day 🥂"
Anxiety,Homesick stress anxietay,Hey I’m currently in Dagestan it’s far away from my home but my grandparents live here so we come here every summer but it’s so boring and I’m very homesick I also have exams in 2 months and currently going through a nicotine withdrawal since snus isn’t sold here and it’s hard to try and study. All of this is giving me a lot of anxiety. I don’t want to tell my parents because they get would probably get offended if I spoke of our home country as a place that doesn’t feel like home to me.it’s really hard and I most likely got a month to go. Any advise how to stay focused and stay positive?
Anxiety,Been having panic attacks almost every night for a week ontop of being sick. Went to the doctor finally.,"My blood pressure was through the rough, and i was having a bit of trouble steadying my breathing. Nurse immediately gave me a prescription for hydroxyzine and is referring me to a psychiatrist. Just about started crying in the clinic. I've been anxious for my entire life, in and out of (non medicated) therapy, and the past two years have kicked the shit out of me. I really hate where I am now, as I feel like an emotional wreck all the time and can barely sleep anymore. But I'm hoping this is a turning point for me. I really don't know what I'll do if this isn't a turning point, I'm so tired of being anxious, not sleeping, and not being able to hang out with people I love because I feel dizzy and like the walls are caving in. I'm only 21 and I feel like I've aged 50 years in the past week alone."

Anxiety,Ear problems,"Does anyone have any stories about problems with their ears impacting their anxiety? I’ve had some feelings of derealization when walking (my arms, legs and balance feels off)  and some occasional dizziness when I lie down. These off feelings induced a panic attack.

Anxiety,Therapy gives me anxiety! Help,"I never really wanted to see a therapist, but by the pressure of everyone, my family, acquaintances, the internet, I seeked ""for help"" my first therapist  really sucked she never said a work it was really uncanny and uncomfortable, so naturally  following the internet  advice I quit her and went on the look for a new one, but they were all to expensive so i took me loke 6 months to find one I could kind of afford ( I know how much everyone hates long texts so I will cut the story short) I liked her but she only worked with seeing her patients once a week or more, which wasn't  my plan and I couldn't  afford, great so after 2 sessions  I quit her too, it took me another 3 months to find my current therapist, I started 5 months ago, and I don't  love her, we clearly  see the world very differently,  but its fine, she listens to me, most of the time... but the problem is that everytime I have to talk to her ( once every two weeks) I just get this crippling  anxiety, so I meet her at 4 p.m. via video call, the whole day before that I feel nervous  and my heart races and the only felling I have is of I just want to get this over with, and so I am so nervous I can't  actually  talk to her, and I get frustrated, and she even said, which felt like a well deserved slap in the face "" well is any obligiting you to be here?  And after I just stay the rest of the day and sometines the next ruminating  on everything I failed to communicate... Idk what to do? There is a part of me that just wants to quit and give up therapy  for good but idk 😣"
Anxiety,"Anxiety,panic,bad feeling.","Hi everyone! Somedays ago i had a panic attack that sent me to an ER,and all tests came back good,and i still feel like something isn't quite right.Most of the time i have a pressure in front head,and nose pressure,difficulty breathing,anxiety,mood swings,blurry vision.When i stand up or walk around i feel dizzy,but sometimes i can wake up and just live like i never had this. So my doc told me im fine etc.But i still feel anxiety,panic,fear. So my question is-Can anxiety make you dizzy,lightheaded,short of breath,scared of dead,fainting etc. Also i became very aware of my breathing and it seems to follow me 24/7 for about a month now,so maybe some of you had same experience,and it will make me feel better to know that i'm not alone that experienced this.

Have a blessed day,and know that whatever you are going trough will get better at some point!"
Anxiety,I know that getting more sleep will help me feel better but the sooner I go to sleep the sooner I have to face the next day,"I get terrible sleep and it's not because I'm staying up to play video games, it's because I'm trying my hardest to delay having to actually face the things I worry about the next day. I don't enjoy my time past 10pm, I want to sleep but I can't because I know once I fall asleep it's like entering a time machine to the morning.

For example, my job starts at 9, I go to sleep at 3. I know this is actually making my anxiety worse because I'm tired. I want to start getting better sleep but I can't get over this trying to delay the next day. 

Is anyone else like this or has any advice for overcoming this?"
Anxiety,Buspar withdrawal depression,"I have been on Buspar for four months, and a psychiatrist upped my dosage from 10mg/day to 60mg during that period. The high dose made me panic out of control, and I dropped my dosage of buspar from 60mg to 30mg over the span of a few days three weeks ago (mistake, shoulda tapered), which also led me to panic and landed me in the ER. Since then, I have felt a ton of withdrawal symptoms. The worst one is severe depression, which does not seem to be letting up, and which I never in my life had before taking BuSpar. 

I am still taking 30mg/day with numerous side effects, but I am afraid of going down farther too quickly. My goal is to be off of the medication. Doctors are convinced there is no way this could be withdrawal, but I’ve had nothing else change in my life. I wanted to add that this was my first time ever on psych meds (and first time addressing mental health), and I was overlooking many of the side effects that I have been having - I thought, for example, that increased anxiety was being caused by reliving past trauma during therapy. 

Anyone else experienced extreme depression during buspar withdrawals?
I’ve also had super vivid dreams, persistent diarrhea, muscle twitching, and nausea/gagging. It’s currently week four of this, and I’m really struggling to make it through. I don’t want to have to get onto another psych med."

Anxiety,Anxiety anxiety everywhere!,"I used to live with a few friends and I starting seeing one of them. We got into a relationship but it was a terrible idea to have it amongst those friends. It was so stressful that we both decided to move out. Except my boyfriend lives with the same friends and I live with new people. I have lived with new people time and again. And my flat mates seem lovely, we don’t spend a ton of time together. But my anxiety has gotten worse and worse since moving. It’s so unbearable now. I have terrible dreams where I’m being burned alive in a house, I have insomnia and it’s only getting worse 😔"
Anxiety,Feel like I’m losing touch with reality,"Ever since I first started experiencing anxiety and panic attacks and such I have always had this brain fog, just dogging me for years now. As my anxiety got better and then got worse and then after starting medications got better again, this brain fog has always remained constant and it makes me feel like I’m in a dream where now I start to think in my mind “is this real?”. For example, driving has become almost scary because in the middle of driving I will be thinking “how am I controlling this? How do I know not to crash or go faster or slower” to the point where it gets me scared and nervous before I calm myself and resume. It has definitely made me drive less now if I know I’ll be on the road for longer. I am able to wake up, eat, do work, play sports etc. but while still questioning what I’m doing because my head just doesn’t seem clear.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips? Thanks"
Anxiety,How do you deal with letting someone your dating know you have chronic mental illness?,I’ve never been in a relationship and have hardly any dating experience. I’ve tried dating in the past but I think my mental health wasn’t good enough for me to be able to do that back then. I am doing better now although my anxiety is still terrible. I’ve been talking to some people and going on some dates but whenever I start getting close to someone I start worrying what they’ll think when they find out I have debilitating anxiety to the point where I can’t work. I also have sensory issues and I stim quite often which I imagine would look quite weird to most neurotypicals. On top of all that I have horrible ADHD and depression (although the depression is decently under control) I never know how to mention it or how soon or if I should wait for a while. I don’t want to scare people off (I have many times) but I don’t want to trap people into a relationship they aren’t prepared for either. I try to casually mention having anxiety but everyone just assumes I mean some sort of mild anxiety. I feel like I’ll never find someone able or willing to handle me so I’ve always just given up.
Anxiety,Tonight I faced one of my greatest fears (kind of),"TLDR AT THE END

I have a severe irrational phobia of moths. I know it doesn’t make sense and they can’t hurt you. No I don’t have the same fear of butterflies. I don’t know why I have it I have been this way since I was a kid. 

When I say severe I mean panic attack and crying at the sight of a moth flying around. Particularly if it is near a place I need to go. 

Well tonight I went to take my dog outside before bed and when I opened the door to my apartment there was a moth flying around the ceiling. A large one. It swooped down towards my door and I screamed and slammed the door. It is an indoor apartment building - my door opens to a hallway not the outside world. I didn’t know how to avoid this moth. I was terrified. My dog needed to pee. I but on a hoodie because that made me feel more protected and I opened my door again. This time it flew at my door. Nope. I couldn’t do it. I slammed the door shut and began to have a panic attack sobbing and all. 15 minutes later I got the courage to try again, deciding that I was just going to open the door and book it with bug spray in hand and that I had to do it. I open the door and… the moth is gone. I spent so long crying that it left. I’d like to think that was the universe’s reward to me for being willing to try. 

Anyway I’m definitely nowhere near being over my fear but at least I took a step and I tried. 

TLDR: I spent so long crying about facing a moth that when I finally had the courage to face it, it was gone."

Anxiety,Is it normal to get spasms when thinking of your phobias?,"Some phobias I have give me muscle spasms. Are any of these normal? They come even when I’m not super scared of them and when I’m in a calm and relaxed state and someone brings them up, I just feel random body parts spasm and I feel like something is swimming or crawling through my veins."
Anxiety,Waking up with racing heart sometimes or just have a faster heart rate at times,"Sometimes I’ll wake up after a couple hours of sleep &amp; just feel like anxious and like my heart is racing a bit. Or I’ll just like have a higher pulse like 95-105 or so. Sometimes I’ll take one of my Ativan’s if I get too anxious. I’ve also had multiple doc visits and cardiologist visits, all tests normal. I know this is anxiety since I have severe anxiety especially the past year it’s intensified. I just hate this cause it all makes me even more anxious.

Anybody have tips on how to deal with this?"
Anxiety,Not wanting to leave house because of sick dog. Reasonable or avoidant behavior?,"My dog was diagnosed with terminal cancer last September and was given a year max, which is soon approaching. With COVID and working from home, I've felt lucky to be with her 24/7 and would like to keep doing this until it's her time to go. 

The day she was diagnosed was traumatic. We got her to the vet in time for emergency surgery, but it would have been easy to miss if we hadn't been home. 

I adopted her 11 years ago and she's been with me my entire adult life. I've only left the house for a few hours max since her diagnosis and can't imagine being away longer. My husband is home with her if I have to leave, so she's never been alone since last September. I want to be with her in case another emergency happens. I don't want her to suffer or be alone when she passes. 

I have social anxiety and OCD, and my therapist thinks I'm using her illness as an excuse to avoid dealing with anxiety outside of my home. In my heart I'm certain that my decision to stay home with her is out of love. 

Just curious what other people think of this. My therapist just really pushed this and wouldn't budge on her thought after I explained why it's important for me to be home with her."
Anxiety,I’m not sure if these are anxiety attacks or not.,"I have pretty bad social and general anxiety. The past couple of weeks and tonight I’ve had moments where all of a sudden my chest becomes quite tight and I struggle to catch a breath. Not like hyperventilating but just a really tight feeling in my chest. 

I also get quite a bit of tunnel vision and feel kind of disoriented and out of it. My heart starts to beat faster and sometimes I get shaky. 

All I can think about when this is happening is how anxious I am or worrying why I’m feeling the way I do and how I must look. 

I started seeing a therapist almost two months ago and this commonly happens there but I try and stay calm and hide it. 

I’m seeing my therapist and doctor on the same day next week and I plan to talk to them about it. 

Could these be anxiety attacks? How should I address it with my therapist and doctor?"

Im not sure if this is the right sub for this, and if it’s not Im sorry, I just need to kinda get this out and it might make me feel better. Anyway last night In my bed I noticed a little bug, I punched it and put it on my dresser and went to sleep, I chalked it up to walking around the garage with long pants and figured the thing had just been a stowaway. But just now I noticed another one, same exact type. I’m really scared, I have a messy room and no shortage of half full soda cans lying around, I’m scared they might be attracted to those, or perhaps their fucking bed bugs. I don’t know. I’m too scared to look up the things cause I hate looking at them. I’m not sure what to do, I don’t have any marks on me or anything. I might me a little over to roof aswell considering I wasn’t the best at managing my meds and they have mental side affects (though they are no phycosocial medications)"
Anxiety,Anxiety makes me wanna ghost my tinder match,"There's a guy from tinder that I've been talking to for a while and everything is going well. He seems to be an amazing guy. We have great chemistry and we're going on our first date soon. However, this whole thing is giving me unbearable anxiety (might be because I've never dated before) and at this point my brain is telling me to just ghost him, which I know is not a solution and I have no intention of actually doing it. 

Has anybody experienced this and found a way to deal with this? Am I just not ready for my first relationship at 22?"
Anxiety,Night terrors?,"For the past year I’ll randomly wake up in the middle of the night and freak out because I don’t know where I’m at even though I’m in my room at my apartment, at my parents, etc. It started with me waking up and feeling around on the wall trying to figure out where I’m at to now getting up and banging on the windows and walls trying to get out? (I’m assuming). Has anyone ever experienced this? It’s definitely scary and ive scared a friend who witnessed it back in September when I woke her up."

Anxiety,Mole Removal (Trigger warning),"I recently got a mole removed (to be biopsied and checked for Melanoma). I have the BIGGEST fear/anxiety about health and body issues. Just getting it done was hard. But I feel the worst just waiting on healing. The anxiety of getting it done was nothing compared to my fear of the stitches breaking. I hate looking at it, cleaning it and the feeling of the skin tightening. I know it’s silly but I wanna cry at the thought of waiting 2 weeks for the stitches to be removed. I worry every time I roll over in bed, move or breathe. I don’t want to go to work and want to just be healed already so I don’t wanna cry myself into panic every day. And yet I should be more worried about awaiting results. I know it makes no sense and is the least of procedures but it’s such a scary thing for me in my mind and anxieties."

my day was like this: i had work in the first half, then had a family event, lastly i went home to play some video games. i suddenly felt very anxious and unsure of what i was even doing in life. like i said before, it made me feel very uncomfortable and overwhelmed by everything. 

these feelings are nothing new to me, but i’ve been more open to actually acknowledging them and how i could deal with them.

sorry if it just sounds like rambling, wanted to write this out so i don’t feel like im going crazy !!"

Anxiety,I don’t feel safe in my own home anymore.,"My home used to be my safety. Here, I was away from most things that caused me anxiety. Social interactions, driving, other people possibly hurting me, etc. 

My husband had to leave to travel for work a few days ago. He’ll be gone for 3 weeks. The day after he left, I went to see my mother and was gone from my house for about 7 hours. When I came home, my back door was unlocked and not even pushed in all the way. 

People in my neighborhood page have been posting about similar activity for several weeks now. They come home to their doors unlocked, but nothing stolen or moved. Most of these women have one thing in common with me: their husbands are away. 

The thing is, I can’t remember the last time I checked to see if that door was locked. It very well could’ve just been unlocked for a while and I had no idea. But it seems like too much of a coincidence. 

I’m terrified and paranoid now. I haven’t been able to sleep for days. My parents came over and checked my house from top to bottom, looking for cameras, stolen items, footprints, anything. Nothing was found. 

I’m unable to sleep. I sit in my bathroom all night with the door locked, clutching a knife. It’s the only place I feel safe. Every little noise scares me so badly. I’m scared there’s either someone in my house, or someone will try to enter my house again. 

I know that logically, no one’s in my house. I know that I probably left the door unlocked, because there’s no sign of damage on the lock like someone broke in. If my husband were home I wouldn’t have even given it a second thought. 

But right now, I’m so terrified. I can’t survive the next 3 weeks like this, not sleeping and on the verge of a panic attack constantly. I feel like I’ll never feel safe at home again, so therefore I’ll never feel safe anywhere again."
Anxiety,How to find passion in life?,I am depressed since a long time now and also diagnosed with anxiety. i cant find something in life that helps me utilize my time constructively. anxiety has made me prison in my own mind i am unable to do simple things like walking in a park or driving car. few years ago i was able to do these things but i think it is the pandemic that has increased my anxiety. i get panic attacks when there is a small traffic jam or at the lights.anyway i am searching for something called passion which i lack.maybe there are so many other things that i am unable to find something i love. i dont know if it is a good idea to search for passion or not.

Anxiety,I thought I had a stroke on the highway today. (M) 29.,"I have been having issues lately with my arms getting tingly and my chest feeling heavy. I have been putting it off as something that will pass (terrible idea, I know) and have just been overall busy with life. Until today.

I was at work and sincerely thought I was just going to fall out on the floor. I ended up leaving early and tried to take off home. My legs started to tingle and my arms were becoming numb. I looked in my side mirror and my face was as white as a sheet. I was on the highway five minutes from home but knew I wasn’t making it. I pulled off onto the shoulder and that’s when it hit me. My hands locked up to the point I couldn’t move my fingers. I was on the verge of passing out but managed to get 911 on the phone. Somehow someway I described my location and the EMTs got to me. 

They calmly assured me that what I had just experienced was an anxiety attack. I just wanted to know if any of you have experienced any symptoms of that nature. I am going to see a doctor Tuesday. I am not asking for a diagnosis I just would like to hear other experiences."

Anxiety,I keep spiraling into internal conversations with myself,"I think of something I'm anxious about and I fall down a rabbit hole. I literally start taking to myself in my head. I go through entire conversations. I don't know if I'm trying to prepare myself for something bad happening or if I'm trying to stimulate what could happen but it just goes and goes and honestly it just makes me incredibly stressed out. Arguments take place in my head but my body reacts as if it is actually happening. My heart rate increases, my chest and throat feel tight and my head starts to hurt. I catch myself and then try to focus on real life but before I know it I'm getting lost in my imagination again. It puts me in a perpetual state of anxiety and stress."
Anxiety,Lasting Covid anxiety is making me feel insecure in my relationship,"So I (22f) and my boyfriend (21m) have been dating since around the beginning of the pandemic. It’s been amazing and realistically, I know our relationship is very secure as we’re both loyal people. But I have issues with anxiety. During the lockdowns, I was pretty ok with living my life at home and after a few months into the pandemic, I stopped feeling like I was missing out on anything. Lately I’ve been going out to restaurants, being invited to graduation events, and traveling (some essential, some non essential).

I recently realized how much anxiety the reopening of everything is giving me. I was super strict about social distancing, never got the virus, and am vaccinated now. I know it should be safe for me to be around others now, but my instincts and anxiety make me feel nervous whenever I go out. I’ve viewed people who have been out partying and not social distancing during the pandemic as terrible who don’t care about others’ safety (in the last months I’ve had a bigger bubble but I mean people who were going to bars and throwing full parties in the height of the pandemic). I am still scared to go out, even when I do feel safe going out and being around people, I feel guilty afterwards. I go to therapy, and my therapist has made me realize that it’s reasonable to feel this way; I’ve gone to more events and socialized in person more in the last few weeks than I have in the last year. I’m trying to ease into it more.

My boyfriend is very outgoing and loves to socialize. Recently I had a big anxious breakdown and then we got into a thing where I learned that he’s a bit unaware of himself when it comes to flirting. He has a really flirty personality and views a lot of things as just being friendly whereas I see them as VERY forward and flirty. He also has said how he can never tell when someone is flirting with them. While I know he is extremely devoted to me and would never do anything to hurt our relationship, I feel insecure and fear he may accidentally give people the wrong impression sometimes. Our conclusion from that difficult conversation was that he’d tell me more about what he was doing and would try to avoid hanging out with women friends one on one at night for drinks and stuff. He’s been going out a lot, to restaurants, bars, and now clubs. Everything combined is giving me so much anxiety. While it’s probably safe, we still don’t know how safe it is and I don’t want to completely disregard health risks now.

Do I ask him to go out less? My anxiety wants me to be mad at him for going out to places like clubs and makes me really worried about him. I’m not about to police him or tell him what he can’t do but I don’t know what to do here? Do I tell him how uncomfortable I feel? Do I ask him to tell me every time he goes out so I can prepare myself mentally and try to worry less? I know it will take time and I’m going to therapy but how do I make myself more ok with this? Covid anxiety plus my insecurity and fear of him being unintentionally flirty is all contributing. I used to feel such a secure attachment to him and now my own issues are making it an anxious one.

I’ve relied on him a lot lately and he’s been so understanding and supportive. I feel bad for wanting to limit what he’s doing and want him to enjoy himself.

TLDR; I have lasting anxiety from covid about going out and get anxious when my boyfriend goes out. I also have insecurities now (slightly reasonable but mostly irrational) that are affecting my relationship."
Anxiety,All of my friends are growing up/changing. Everyone my age is so boring now. Is this how being an adult is?,"Im a 26yr guy and have pretty much had the same friend group since high school or even younger. When I was in high school and early 20s my best friends would always call me to hang out randomly and we would have fun all the time just doing nothing. We would play Pokemon go until 2am, watch scary movies all night, walk down to the beach while we gossip about boys or school etc. When we became college age we would spend nights drinking or going out. 

This was all great until a couple years ago when literally everyone became so boring and old acting. Its like all of my friends are different people now. I understand that life changes and people get into relationships, get jobs etc. But I also have a boyfriend who I live with, have a good job, commitments etc. yet I still feel and act the same as I always did. Its not that I can't hang out with my friends, usually if I call them I can set up plans (although not even half as often as before) but when we hang out its so different. Now it always has to be a double date with my boyfriend and there's joining too, instead of staying up all night having fun usually around 9 or 10 they tell me they are tired and are going to call it a night even though its a weekend. It also has to be planned out in advance. Before almost every time we would hang out it would usually be following a random text asking what im up too or if I want to go grab ice cream or drink. Now we have to choose a day and be sure there's no work or school in the way. Im a spontaneous person but now I don't even bother randomly asking my friends to hang because I know it will be the usual ""Im doing blah blah blah with my boyfriend tomorrow or im too tired but what about next weekend?"".

Maybe im just refusing to grow up and immature for my age. idk but its making me feel so anxious and depressed about my life lately. Whats the point of life if its all boring? I find myself always trying to make friends with people way younger then me just because they actually want to have fun. I always find new friends who are 18-21 because our energy matches but at the same time we don't totally get along because they are so young. Can anyone here relate to this? What is your normal social life as an adult?"
Anxiety,Anxiety attack after I caught my sister drinking,"We are at my grandparents cottage  for the weekend. I woke up to sounds of running around and I see that my sister is in her room throwing up. She admitted she drank vodka shots. She is 15. My grandma found out and is going to tell our mom. Im worried for both my sister right now who currently is drunk and suicidal and I want to call my mom but my grandma is not letting me do so because she doesn’t want my mom to be woken up. I can’t sleep.  Im shaking because I’m so anxious, and worried my parents will blame me and kick me out. But I was sleeping and didn’t even know. Didn’t know my sister has depression. I feel like a terrible sister for not letting her vent to me right now but I’m having panic attacks and I literally cannot function. Not sure what to do, I just want her to be helped but I’m not a therapist. She told me she drank because she couldn’t take it anymore. Obviously She needs to seek mental help. Sadly I live in a very dysfunctional family, that blames you for being depressed , or anxious (in my case). I’m mentally okay but right now, I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack because my sister made a very bad decision. Unsure of what to do, how to cope. I need sleep but how can one sleep in this position."
Anxiety,Anyone else get a weird feeling after a bad dream?,"Hello nice people 😊

About an hour ago I woke up from a horrible night of sleep. Firstly, I must have slept in a bad position because my neck is super sore. 

Secondly, I had nightmares the whole night and sometimes when that happens I get a very weird, dreadful feeling which sometimes stays the whole day. I don’t really know how to describe it, but it’s a mixture of dread (like something bad is about to happen), melancholy, bad mood and a bit of sadness. Like the weird/unpleasant feeling you had during the bad dream transfers in real life.

I’m wondering, does that happen to anyone else as well?

If yes, how do you shake this feeling off?"
Anxiety,DAE overshare and feel bad about it for days after,"Used to think it was just when Id been drinking and would get the fear the next few days but now realise its any group situation.

Its like I have to make sure the convo flows so I'll talk and talk, overshare, always give my opinion and relative stories rather than just sit back and listen to others and keep my mouth shut. 

Regret for days after thinking about everything I've said and cringe at the thought of some of it.

Anyone else?! Any tips to start accepting myself for it or stop doing it??"
Anxiety,"I M25 have stopped my meds to try to figure out what my sexuality is, only growing more depressed and anxious","I'm looking for advice, not sure if this is the right subreddit but I figure I'll give it a go. This is a bit complicated so let me explain.

I'm a M25... I don't know. And that is one of the biggest things that upsets me, the not knowing my sexuality. Only recently have I been able to begin exploring. I keep flipping back and forth on if I'm asexual, or gay, or bi. It's almost fluid, where I'll go weeks feeling asexual, then I'll feel either into just guys, or into guys and girls. I've got a lot of mental stuff going on too, severe panic disorder and depression. I was on medication for those, and it does help, but the anxiety meds, the SSRI's just kill my ability to be sexual. It's worse than just not being sexual, I still get horny, I still try to masturbate, but it can takes hours to get there and when I do often times the orgasms are just not there. 

The confusion comes to a big part because I'm a furry, as far as the asexual stuff, that's towards humans. I'm almost always into male and female furry art. I'm almost always into, mostly male, fursuit sex videos (murrsuit videos). But when it comes to humans, I go weeks at a time not attracted to them. That alone has made me depressed and sometimes feel suicidal, I feel broken. 

Well, I met this guy a bit back on a furry app, and we have hit it off quite well, and we plan on getting together and hooking up. I want to experiment and see what I like since I've never been with anymore before. I decided I was going to stop taking the SSRI's so I could actually be sexual. About two weeks off them and I'm crazy horny, but also my anxiety is taking over and I'm having panic attacks again.

Growing up in an extremely religious environment, even though I don't believe that stuff, I still have that ""Christian guilt"" and have been having anxiety attacks about everything. But the most prevailing ones are how I'm not going to be ""pure"" anymore since I'm going to be losing my virginity. How I'm going to regret it because this isn't a romantic special general romance movie setting, and that because of that I'm ruining my ""first time.""

I know the very first thing people are going to say is to go back on my medication. And I'm going to, after next week. I don't want to not be able to perform because of some dumb pills. Another thing I've heard before is to try different meds that don't have the side effects. Which, honestly sounds like that comes from people who either have never been on SSRI's or got insanely lucky. I've been on 4 different ones off the top of my head I've been on to the same medical castration results. Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil, and Celxa all after 8+ months still leave me sexually stunted. 

It really sucks because some people are going to say sex isn't as important as mental health, but it just makes me more depressed and feel even more broken than I already feel if I can't get off after hours of trying. 

So what do I do? How do I stop feeling like my first time needs to be this stereotypical romantic master piece from movies and TV shows? Knowing all of this, what do you say about the medication? I know I need to be on it, I can FEEL that, I feel myself being so much more emotional and anxious, but at the same time I don't want to miss out on things in life. I feel like I'm almost too old to be in the ""experimenting"" phase, that I should already know what the hell I am, be it gay, or bi, or asexual, or something else. The not knowing, even on the medication when I'm more stable mentally, makes me so depressed and feel broken."
Anxiety,How can I get over the fear of failure when it comes to creative hobbies?,"I desperately want to create, I've brought tons of courses, materials, but everytime I start to dive in, I'm immediately assulted with 'I cant do this' and I just give up, which often turns my depression worse (I'm medicated and in therapy for it). Even if it goes well for a week or two doing lessons when I try to make something myself just to simply enjoy it, I get so anxious and negative that it stops me from even finishing a piece. I really need to get over this but I just don't know how. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this and has some tips?"
Anxiety,Anybody feel like their anxiety is an exterior force that is controlled by something else?,"I don’t mean this on a level of psychosis (like someone else is in control of my thoughts etc) although I do get anxiety about having schizophrenia!

But what I mean is like the dark, unfamiliar feelings of doom that manifest as a symptom of my anxiety, often feel like a dark exterior presence rather than just a part of my brain. A bit like a bully following you around or waiting for you after school. I was never bullied at school but I very much imagine this is what it feels like. 

We were out for food last night and I was enjoying myself and all of a sudden it was on me and I just started feeling extreme dread for no reason, literally like a dark force had come and sat at my table, numbed me up and reminded me that everything is doomed no matter what I do or where I go. 

I think it’s down to the fact that ultimately I have the best intentions for myself, I’d never purposely make myself feel those dark feelings, so it makes it seem like something else is doing it and making me feel so bad. It actually makes me angry sometimes. Like f*#k off and leave me alone and actually let me enjoy myself for once!!!"
Anxiety,Advice?,"So if I have something exciting, or worrying coming up, I have extremely extreme physical responses. I have debilitating stomach aches, and got them everyday going to school. Then once school was over I had a 6 month period where I couldn’t leave the house without throwing up out of fear. That put a lot of things on hold obviously. I shake, get headaches, get head rush, feel very ill all over, and of course a lot of general fear. How do I begin to cope with this. I don’t really have any methods, it just sort of goes away. The throwing up stopped over Christmas, and the stomach aches aren’t as often or as extreme anymore. However it’s all still there to an extent. Especially with the vaccines coming up, I am terrified recently. I get all of those symptoms very severely, just from remembering and thinking about the COVID Jab. Does any have any advice?"
Anxiety,Adding my dad on Facebook was an awful idea,"I added him because I thought it was mean if I didn't. But I follow all sorts of pages, including a couple of bisexuality ones and a couple of polyamory ones. (He knows I'm bi, but not that I'm polyamorous, nor that I'm back with my first ex. He just thinks I'm single and not interested.)

Last night, my friend added some photos on their Facebook profile from a party I attended. It was a pretty great party, and I super enjoyed it - I also like being included. But my partner is in some of the photos, and I'm in others. It's pretty clear they're from the same party. If my dad sees this, I'll have a bit of explaining to do. This also makes me wonder what else he's seen from my profile. I don't know how private pages are on Facebook."
Anxiety,I just wanna lay in a fucking field.,"Stare at the sky and forget about all of the shit.

Anxiety,"I got scolded, again, because of my anxiety.","Disclaimer: I wasn't paying any attention to it today as it hasn't been acting up lately however, I'm literally breaking down crying right now because of it.

My mother asked me to light a fire with the use of matches. Now there's something about them that makes me really anxious and I don't know what. I have played with matches before when I was younger and I find it fun. However as I grew, I find that just holding one stick makes me uncomfortable and the thought of lighting it, makes me so anxious I break down. It honestly scares me.  

Anyways, my mother asked me to light a fire and I can't bring myself to do it, I just stared at it until she yelled at me to do something. That's when I realized I was anxious about it. She keeps on pushing me to do it but I just couldn't. I stared at the match bringing myself to light it but instead, tears filled my eyes and I couldn't breathe. Still, she scolded me saying I am a coward and I don't know how to do anything. It made me really insecure. I realized she never understood anxiety, that instead of her comforting me, she's breaking my self-esteem apart. The one that should comfort me makes it so hard for me that I just couldn't stand that place any longer.

Idk, I'm prolly making a big deal out of it but I'm just really upset. Forget about the matches and the fire, it made me really sad that my mother couldn't understand my anxiety."

Anxiety,Toilet anxiety,"Although a weird anxiety, it is definitely real. Like a type of agoraphobia, I'm scared of leaving the house and going somewhere with no toilets nearby. This happens all the time, on a car ride, bus or train and even in school. We recently had national tests for 3 hours straight and I wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom at all, it's stressing me out.

Tomorow me and my class are going out on a school trip and there probably won't be any toilets around. How do I overcome this ridiculous anxiety?"
Anxiety,Question for people with health anxiety,"Everytime I feel something is wrong with my eyes, I conatantly feel my eyes to see if anything is wrong, I close my eyes, Open them when theyre closed (You may know what I mean) and feel the my eye. How do I stop doing this, any tips to stop?"
Anxiety,"not doing great, can't take it anymore","I keep delaying stuff that I have to do and it's getting WORSE.

I was staring at the phone doing absolutely nothing. Then I cried."
Anxiety,Realization/Vaccine,"I am about to get my second shot for the vaccine, and leading up i was super anxious about the side affects especially the nausea/vomiting.

Anxiety,Heading to a date and I'm dying!,"So I woke up before 7am after going to sleep at around 2:30am, so not much sleep cos you know how it is. I picked my clothes ready for the date, cleaned my shoes and all that. Get out and my bloody jeans have cat hair all over them despite washing then since being in my cat-free house 😭 I've done as much as I can. We'll only really be eating and walking so maybe she won't notice?

Thing is though, I'm really excited for this date! Sure enough, anxiety has been killing me through the whole lead up (it's been a long one) but more than a year ago, I would have been absolutely bricking it to even think of going on a date with someone. Now here I am, finally taking control of my own life and that's the most important thing!

Also, wanna give a shout out to citalopram!"
Anxiety,Anxiety and rumination daily life and beingqdult- Beg you read till end😭😭,"I have severe anxiety about life because fuck I feel like I do not know anyhting. Feel like I would probably end up dead without parents.

Is it normal to know a lot of things?

For example I am writing this from a phone my parents bought me and they bought the sim card.

Say I bought the phone from amazon where the fuck would I buy the sim card from?

Do I buy from internet and they ship or go to carrier shop and want a sim card?


Fuck I think so complex and everything start covered with a fog more after ruminating.

What is wrong with me?"
Anxiety,Sick of it...,"I'm sick of not being able to open up, even when I'm sitting with a group of close friends i still don't feel and act the same as when im alone.Thus I'm often misjudged and wrongly interpreted by newly met people.Different substances sometimes help me overcome, but I can't be doing addictive stuff just to be true self"
Anxiety,Health anxiety kicking in..,Is it normal for you to struggle to hold your knife in your left hand properly when eating like cutting and holding it right with me being right handed? i can use it but find it harder to grip is it just because i am right handed?. It’s like when i write it feels weird in my left but feels better in my right hand. When i focused on it it gave me anxiety i felt i was losing my grip and weakness and all that but it’s just because i am right handed i am guessing?

Anxiety,Relationship anxiety and OCD,"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with GAD when I (25F) was 6. When I was 21, I was diagnosed with OCD and GAD. 

Recently in my relationship, I found out my boyfriend of 10 months was married and going through the divorce process, but he never told me. So he’s technically still legally married but almost divorced. I confronted him about it, and he told me the truth and we moved forward. Fast forward another month, and I saw his ex wife’s name pop up on his phone and it was a snapchat notification. I told him I felt it was extremely inappropriate to be snap chatting her. I understand they have to text/call each other for the divorce process, but snapchat is inappropriate. He agreed and said he would delete her. Then this past weekend, I could’ve sworn I saw her on his best friends list on snapchat. When I confronted him about it, he freaked out and said he can’t handle this and won’t show me that it wasn’t her on his phone. This has put me in a complete anxiety spiral over everything in our relationship. 

After both of these events happened, I get so upset over any little thing my boyfriend does. Yesterday we went out for drinks with his friend and his girlfriend and I got upset in front of them because his friends gf and I were talking about his previous marriage and how he never told me he was married. Then my boyfriend got snippy with me when we ordered fries and I saw there wasn’t ketchup. He said “why can’t you ask the waitress yourself? I don’t have to do it”. And then I just started crying. 

I’m super embarrassed about this happening in front of his friends and I really think I need to start seeing a therapist again. My OCD and anxiety keeps replaying this scenario that happened last night over and over again in my head and now I’m worried that I completely ruined our relationship because of how easily upset I get.

Has anyone had any success with relationship anxiety getting better? Any tips would be greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,Please help,"Sorry for the “please help” title, I’m just worrying a lot about having sex for the first time and I have a question regarding protection.
Is it “safe”(by safe I’m talking pregnancy wise, not referring to stds) to have unprotected sex(no condoms) if I’ve been taking birth control pills for 6 months? Also, what are my chances of getting pregnant if I have unprotected sex and my so doesn’t pull out? 

Fyi, I’m on the estrogen&amp;progesterone combination pill and I take the pill the same time everyday. My so and I are both virgins but that is probably going to change soon and I just fear pregnancy. 

Thank you to everybody who stopped by to help me out."
Anxiety,Anxiety with... mouse clicks,Hey guys. For the past year I’ve had trouble using mice because of the anxiety I get from them. The reason why is that every click that I make is a completely different feeling and texture. I’ve tried so hard to ignore this but it’s just so unbearable. I really would like some advice on how to deal with this.
Anxiety,Who else just feels unsafe sometimes when there's no reason to be?,
Anxiety,Something very strange occurred earlier (TW SUICIDE),"Im a 14 year old kid and i experienced something that creeped me out earlier. Somebody was upset with me, so I felt sad and put music on. Next thing I know ""komm susser tod"" from evangelion starts to play out of nowhere after listening to nine inch nails and my first impulse is to turn it off, but I left it on. 

Well next thing I know, i start crying while the song plays and I start to think about evangelion, which is already quite depressing itself. And next thing, resonance from soul eater (another anime) starts playing. Now soul eater isn't nearly as dark as eva, but I remembered a particular character (crona) being a heavily misunderstood ""villain"" and then befriended by maka (the main character). Well i have always related to crona and i got a memory of bursting into tears after watching that episode and i never cry over shows or movies. Eva and soul eater were the only ones. 

And then something worse happened... I started thinking about myself and how for the past year I have gotten even worse emotionally and how bad everything has been and how much i cant even begin to fathom being able to express. And I realized how there's definitely something wrong with me. How I've always been the ""weird autistic"" kid to everyone and how I've never gotten help for anything. How my mom ignores me, how my dad used to abuse me and how someone else uses me all the time and exploits me. 

I thought about the summer of last year when i began realizing i could hide under a blanket for hours to feel better and how that is something i do on a daily now. How overwhelmed ive been, how im failing school and how i worry im a bad person and may become a sociopath. How i get so anxious at night to where I will pee on a towel in my room sometimes (ik it's disgusting)

And then i realized that im probably gonna do nothing in my life and just be a failure. My whole life already feels screwed up, and I realized in 3 months i will be 15 which is terrifying. Because i both look, sound and feel younger than that. Emotionally I can't even regulate myself and i feel like a stupid little kid constantly throwing tantrums. Then I got a really weird feeling. Like i felt like i was gone and nothing was real. Like i knew that i was real and everything else was, but it didn't feel like that. It felt like I wasn't even there and i was just watching something weird. At this point i was crying even more. And then i got suicidal thoughts (i get them more than I probably should) and realize how lonely and unliked I generally am. And how I don't even have interests anymore and i do nothing all day. Im just so tired and i want freedom but i feel so messed up. Maybe some of this is trauma getting to me but im worried."
Anxiety,Help.. I’m going to be a groomsman at a wedding .,I’m throwing up already.. please help me
Anxiety,How to deal with being scared when you're alone?,"Often I'll have to stay at my dads house alone, and it's kind of in the middle of nowhere (no neighbours for kilometers). 

When im there alone my brain always creates these insane scenarios that freak me out, like someone coming up to break in, or murder me. Sometimes I'll perceive the creaking of the house as whispers or footsteps, and very clearly too. 

It doesn't help that there's a second story which I never go up to, and am convinced that someone could be hiding in one of the rooms. 

Essentially I know that I am probably safe, but I am so fucking anxious when I'm alone ; one sound and my heart will beat so loud i can barely hear (not an exaggeration)

I usually sleep with a knife under my bed or just carry one around with me everywhere (much more likely to hurt myself this way than there be an intruder, I know)

Q : Does anyone else deal with this type of fear when their alone? I think it would help to just text or call someone when im feeling like this but I don't want to bother anyone."
Anxiety,Social media anxiety,"I’m hoping I’m not alone in this or at least that I don’t sound nuts. 

I would say, over the last year, I get very anxious when it comes to social media. Specifically, who my audience is and how I’m engaging with others. 

My last ex basically stalked me. There wasn’t much I could do without her knowing about it. It didn’t end there — she showed up at my apartment and even sent a handwritten letter to me (she found my address online) without my permission (prior to our split, I hadn’t invited her over to my place during that time). 

It’s now gotten to the point where I share the occasional update about my life, but I very rarely engage with others. I don’t want them to get the idea they’re being constantly monitored; also, it makes me feel weird. (I don’t know why. The point is to have an audience of some kind, so I recognize it doesn’t make a ton of sense) share content myself, but it’s rarely of significant value. My profiles are all locked down pretty heavily and I tend to be rather selective in who I give access to. 

The best thing I’ve been able to do is intermittent social media breaks. I either don’t post or temporarily disable my accounts. I’m on the verge of another small break. Things haven’t been going too well for me lately and it might be time.

I’m just curious if anyone can relate or if this makes sense?"
Anxiety,I Can’t Make Eye-Contact,"I don’t know where else to vent about this so hopefully I’m at the right place. 

As long as I can remember, I never made eye contact with people. It wasn’t until high school when I realized how important eye contact is and by that time, I was so set in my ways that it was excruciatingly uncomfortable to force it. I’ve challenged myself to force eye contact and it just never feels natural at all. It honestly doesn’t bug me that much and hasn’t affected my life (at least I don’t think it has), but is there anyone here that goes through this? Is there a word for this? Did you ever fix it?"
Anxiety,Anxiety due to overstimulation / too much interaction?,"Disclaimer: my therapist is unavailable for a few months so I can't discuss with them.

Apologies in advance about the wall of words. I'm trying really hard to make sense of this because I have not been able to pinpoint it. Maybe someone in here has gone through it and has a term for it?

I am an introvert with a highly social job in which I thrive. I learned to sustain several hours of constant professional interaction without needing to recharge. However I find social settings extremely overwhelming, and I think it's because they involve a lot of small talk and idle chatting. It feels like they are draining all my energy, and I feel like my brain ""overheats"". When I can't remove myself from these situations, without  fail I'll end up getting an anxiety attack, and sometimes it has taken me weeks to recover from a single episode. 

I also have a hard time with very loud / screeching noises.

I have a rambunctious five year old, and my anxiety actually got worse since I gave birth. My husband is a really great dad and *constantly* interacts with our son. Obviously I wouldn't have it any other way; my father was distant on a good day and abusive on a bad one. I wish I could join them, but even hearing them play rough drains me. They constant chatting drains me. My son's excitement drains me. I accept that children can very often be challenging, but I shouldn't find my workday less stressful than spending time with my favourite person in the whole world.

I have a great little family, a happy marriage, and we're all in good health, but I resent holidays because I find them so overwhelming. I'm in the UK, and this week schools have been closed for the holidays. I spent the whole week bottling up my anxiety because I don't want my son's perception of positive experiences to be conditioned by my mental health issues, but all I've wanted to do was cry and scream and not see anybody for the whole time. Everywhere is so loud and overcrowded, I just find it unbearable. My husband had promised to take our son to a theme park, and I offered to go because I felt it was my duty, but this was five days ago and I haven't yet recovered. It was so overwhelming I don't even have the strength to think or talk about it.

Usually I get anxiety this bad at Christmas when I can't escape family reunions, but it's now a lovely sunny week in June and I actually had another anxiety attack last Friday just because I got reminded that I had agreed to take my son to a playdate, which meant having to do small talk with two perfectly lovely other mums.

I know I don't suffer from social anxiety: I could go out with the same two ladies without our children, and be able to have deep conversations, uninterrupted, and that would be fine."
Anxiety,I went to a wedding last night and stay almost two hours!,"I know it’s not much but it’s a step and it makes me feel like I can keep getting closer to where I was pre-covid.

Anxiety,Anxiety nausea?,"So I’m on vacation 16 hours from home and i was doing ok but once we got to the hotel I felt so nauseous.I was having a really bad panic attack, but it got the the point my throat felt so nauseous and I thought I was gonna be sick. It was so scary. But once I calmed down it was gone. I was hungry it was fine. But it really felt like I was sick and now I’m worried. Does anyone else have these somatic anxiety symptoms? how do you relieve it or push it away? Cause I have such a hard time when I’m nauseous because I get more anxiety which makes it worse idk."
Anxiety,Feeling Guilt &amp; Shame This Morning,"Last night I had a panic attack in front of my SO. It's not the first time that's happened, but it was the worst. My anxiety has ebbed and flowed over the last year in particular, but here lately it's increased from a low jackhammer hum 5 miles away to a medium jackhammer hum about a mile away. It's just this constant humming, that while I've grown used to it, is easier to flare up in to a full blown panic attack. 

I know there is nothing to be ashamed of, but I am ashamed that anyone saw it, and walking around with guilt this morning, wondering how anyone could possibly want to stick around if they have to put up with that, not to mention the emotional hangover of such strong feelings rushing through last night, and I don't know how to separate from this. I want to isolate, to hide, and I'm desperate for it not to be brought up today but desperate to try to justify what happened. 

I'm working on coping mechanisms, therapy, and self-care routines, but the closer the world gets to being fully opened the more anxious I'm getting. I know no one can tell me how to stop it all together, but could use some general love this morning. Thanks in advance, for the love, for being courageous enough to share your story, and for letting others know they aren't alone."
Anxiety,Book suggestions,"I’m looking for books that specifically help with anticipation anxiety, and unrelated; seeing bodies for what they are, not as objects or following societal pressures. Thanks in advance if you have any suggestions!"
Anxiety,Panic attacks,"So i recently lost.money on crypto, family savings and now i started to get panic attacks and anxiety. Feel like a failure all day, cant sleep or eat well, sometimes i cry out of nowwhere and my body shakes.Any tips to cope with that"
Anxiety,convinced i am gonna die of a heart attack within a few days. constant debilitating fear. idk why. i hate this i wanna go back to my normal self,"I'm a 20 year old trans guy, heart health is fine..but it all started when i one day i had some anxiety and felt some heart palpitations and skips. then i had a lil dizzy spell (sometimes happen when I'm abt to have periods) 
like 10 days ago or more. ever since then i started spiraling into this fear. 

i witnessed my mother die of a heart attack as a child and many ppl are telling me that it might be a fear that stems from that

I'm hypervigilant to the point where sounds scare me. I've been to multiple doctors everytime i felt any sort of symptom. everyone told me it's anxiety. I went to the ER after multiple long panic attacks where i felt dizzy in between. blood work done and ecg came back perfectly normal. I'm trying so hard to believe doctors but i can't. i am in an obsessive state ig? idk it's hard to describe my thoughts.. they're all racing. i have ADHD so my mind NEVER SHUTS UP. it's constantly afraid 24/7. i cry almost daily. i can't sit still and sometimes i go to a place where i felt anxious and my throat closes up and i can't focus on anything besides fear. i hate this. i hate living like this. i never had this much anxiety. idk how to cope well. i constantly think i am going to die in a second..

i started thinking that it might not be worth upgrading my pc because i might be dead by the time it arrives. this is not normal. it's hard to believe i am still alive after all this anxiety, muscle tension... panic attacks,, crying... etc etc but that's sort of reassuring me ig. if i haven't had a heart attack yesterday then i am certainly not having one now.

but again..i can't stop being afraid. i am so fucking scared. i don't wanna die now. i hate anxiety i hate this brain i wish it stopped bothering me so much. i just wanna live my life.

my GP suggested therapy as soon as possible and i agree but that's also kinda hard to accept..i am trying. somedays i get a lil better and i can do something i like without having an anxiety attack. i think I'm doing ok"
Anxiety,How do I stop overthinking?,"I have a bad tendency to overthink and usually it messes up my whole day especially when I overthink about something I don’t like. I often try to reassure myself to calm down and relax, but I end up overthinking things without realizing it."
Anxiety,Numb fingertips that come and go,I have anxiety that primarily focuses on health anxiety. Recently when I sleep on my back with my hands above my head I wake up with one or both hands numb. Also I randomly get numb finger tips. Usually it’s one or 2 finger tips at a time and then an hour or two later the finger tips numbness is gone. My biggest concern is always having a stroke so that’s why it worries me. Is this something to even worry about or totally normal or anxiety related?
Anxiety,Nothing like being unable to sleep because of anxiety.,Fuck. A lot of shit has been going on in my head recently. I've been waking up with pretty severe anxiety. This fucking sucks. Fuck.
Anxiety,I'm getting my picture taken at work tomorrow,"I need to dye my hair and buy new clothes. They're writing an article about me and my team and what we do. (I'm a social worker on a police unit that helps people with various needs and makes rehab more accessible) 

They want to take my picture for the article and website. I hate my body, I hate my face, I hate the attention. I just want to do my job and help people. 

I'm going shopping with my husband later and it's always a massive hit to my self esteem to see how much weight I've gained and how my sizes just keep going up."
Anxiety,I can't swim,"When I was about 5 or 6, my dad told me about dry drowning. If you don't know what it is, basically if you get some water in your lungs, you can die in your sleep, something like that. It terrified tf out of me and everytime I got out of the pool when I was a kid, I would make him check my lungs with a stethoscope. I almost never went under water unless I was physically holding my nose.


As an adult, I am 20F and I literally can't swim. When I get in the water up to my neck, there is heavy pressure on my chest and I feel like I can't breathe. I'm not even consciously thinking about the dangers of swimming but my body still reacts strangely. I doubt it's a physical thing since I don't have a problem like that anywhere else in my life.


My dad really was the source of a lot of my anxiety. What he saw as teaching me the dangers of the world, I saw another thing to be afraid of. Everything was always a teaching moment about how I gotta be careful all the time. I really wanna get over these childhood traumas but a lot of them are probably hidden away and I don't even remember them."
Anxiety,"My intrusive thoughts expand in terms of topic, and the fear of arousal also expands."," I've been dealing with a specific sexual theme in terms of intrusive thoughts and ow every time I read something the fear/thoughts expand to it. For example, a few minutes ago I had a fear I wouldn't be able to get off to anything other than this specific thing because I read a post by a guy who said that he imagines the specific thing before and during intercourse with his wife because he couldn't get aroused the same without it, and now I'm scared that'll happen to me, the thing is I can get aroused by ""normal"" sexual things just fine. Has this happened to anyone else?"
Anxiety,Waking up in panic attacks night after drinking,"Hi, just want to know if anybody else gets this experience as well.

I started citalopram about 3 years ago and it went really well in the beginning year but my anxiety has slowly crept back.

Sometimes after a night of drinking a fair bit ( I do know this doesn’t help but it does happen occasionally!) I am fine for most of the day but then when I go to bed at night I wake up every 10 mins in the start of a panic attack and then go back to sleep and happens about 15 times over sometimes.

This sometimes makes me have a couple drinks before bed only to calm this down as don’t ever want to drink the next day.

Does any one suffer with this or know how to deal with it? Maybe upping my dosage as my anxiety is a bit worse recently and everything in life is quite smooth atm."
Anxiety,My mom is making fun of me and my health related anxiety,"I freak out really badly over anything health related. I'll feel like passing out from the smallest thing. Today I woke up and one of my cuticles was inflamed. I freaked out and had an overall horrible morning but I brought myself to care for it and move on.


Now she keeps bringing it up and saying how its such a serious thing and I might even have to go to the hospital if I dont do something, just to mock how I was acting.


Its so stressful as I just managed to calm myself down and she's making me freak out even more."
Anxiety,Fidget rings?,"Has anyone here used one for those ""anxiety fidget rings""? The ring that's rotate on your finger freely? I was considering getting one since I always tend to do anything and everything with my hands when I'm feeling overstimulated/overwhelmed. Did it help you with your fidgeting?"
Anxiety,Don't want to eat anymore,"Anxiety has affected me so much lately, so much that I had a bug about a month and a bit ago which completely put me off my appetite. Since then I've been scared to eat food as I'm anxious it will make me sick from it so I constantly Google ""will ___ make me sick?"" For my age I should be 11 stone and I'm currently 7 stone. Any tips on how to overcome this fear and regain weight? 

Thank you,"
Anxiety,Buspirone non horror story?,"I started buspirone for GAD after ignoring the fact that I could no longer function day to day. I’ve been on every antidepressant and anxiety medication under the sun so I was surprised to discover one I haven’t tried. Reading about others experiences scared me. It’s only been two weeks but I feel so clear. I can think clearly, do daily tasks without becoming so overwhelmed I shut down, and I don’t constantly feel like I’m waiting for something terrible to happen. I do get this weird moment about 30 mins after I take it where I sweat, feel nauseous, and have the worst vertigo but it passes. 
Just want to throw some good feelings out there for buspirone :)"
Anxiety,Does anyone else feel numb/tingly while having anxiety attacks?,I’ve had anxiety attacks since i was a  child but for the last few years they’ve been much worse. I’ve always hyperventilated and cried my eyes out. but when they’re really bad i can’t even move my body. I just sink to the floor and i go completely numb. No feeling in my body nd other times my arms and chest goes tingly. It’s really terrifying and i’m wondering if my medication has brought on these more severe attacks?
Anxiety,Roommate Social Anxiety,"New roommates &amp; extreme social anxiety

I'm currently in a living hell for someone with SA, to say the least. I'm living abroad for college at the moment in Spain, and it was all fine until just a week ago. I was living with a girl and her boyfriend that spoke pretty good English. They were very welcoming and in general lovely people. I stayed with them for 2 weeks and we became pretty good friends within that short period of time. These were only temporary living arrangements as there were some issues with booking so they let me stay until I found another before their new flatmate arrived.

That being said i'm generally pretty good at meeting new people and speaking to them if they are welcoming, as it is their home. However the new people I live with are 3 other guys. They all introduced themselves briefly when I moved in, they don't speak English (I know a little Spanish, but can barely hold a conversation), and I have the worst room in the house. There is a long corridor with 3 bedrooms, the kitchen and the bathroom branching off that leads to the common area, and across the room there is my room. They are always chilling in there and talking in Spanish (I don't have a problem with that, we're in Spain, it just adds to the anxiety of not being able to communicate properly).

I feel to scared to even open the door to get to the bathroom or to the kitchen for food or a glass of water. I haven't eaten well at all because i'm so anxious to be seen in the kitchen. Like wtf is wrong with me? Everyone needs to eat but for some reason the thought of being seen and interacting makes me anxiously sweat. I generally have to wait till they leave the common area which is rare and I would make a beeline for the bathroom to finally go. To make matters worse theres a window in my room and on the other side you can see the balcony, they always stand there while talking and smoking and I basically hide behind my wardrobe so they think i'm not even in there.

Like mentioned above I generally have no problem meeting new people when they're welcoming and such, but it feels so awkward, I can barely communicate with these people, and I have to awkwardly interact with them if I want to simply get some water. It makes me so anxious. I've always had a degree of SA, but I thought I was doing much better as my last place my roommate was telling me how much she was going to miss me and how well we function as roommates, after only 2 weeks. But here I just feel like the complete opposite.

Does anyone know if theres anything I can do/keep in mind when dealing with this, to lessen my anxiety?

Edit: Just wanna include as well that I have no problem meeting friends of friends, dating, my own friends etc etc. if its pretty much a given that the people i'm going to meet are going to be friendly in some way then I have no issue with it. It's them awkward interactions like i'm in now where I don't know these people and if they even want to speak to me. I hate to think i'm that English speaking guy who they don't like because I don't speak Spanish.

TLDR: Living with non-English speaking roommates, interacting with them is awkward and I hate to be seen by them."
Anxiety,Post anxiety after drinking with coworkers,"Overthinking every little thing, hoping i didn’t drink too much, hoping i didn’t overshare, hoping i didn’t make a complete fool out of myself....anyone relate, how do you overcome this???? I can’t do fun things in life because it literally will keep my brain consumed  For the next week i hate it so much :("
Anxiety,I'm so sick of this disease called anxiety.,"If this turns out to be fairly long, I apologize. Also, some things mentioned may trigger some (sexual...suicide). Proceed with caution. 

To the ""normal"" people of the world... This would probably sound absolutely insane, but to people who stuggle like me, it would sound normal. Even if it does sound stupid, please don't judge me. I'm beating myself up enough.

Let me start by saying... I have a very hard time saying no if someone wants to have sex. It comes from a relationship where if I said no, I would be forced. Now, let's get into what my wonderful anxiety is feeding on now. 

Yesterday, a male friend of mine came to town from out of state. I haven't seen him in years. We have always sort of had a thing for each other. Anyways, we were at a public fishing area. We walked around the front where everyone was at. Eventually, we ended up in my car and we drove to the back part of this place where a lot of people never really go. It's almost like a wooded area with a boating ramp and a small parking area? Well, as we sat down on the dock things got well... Heated? Well... I was trying to say no but of course... I couldn't. So we walk to my car let the seats down in the back and close the doors...you know what happens next. In broad daylight. But that's not the problem. All of a sudden i start worrying and am now scared to death there may have been hidden security cameras and that the police is going to see this and I'm going to end up on a registery and never get to see my child again. It was pretty obvious what was happening. I think this is mostly because this park has a pavillion area that has a sign posted saying that area has 24 hour surveillence (way on the other side of the park.) It has gotten to the point in one day I am googling every single state law and honestly... Its making it worse but i cant stop. It sounds ridiculous and it's extreme catastrophising because people do this sort of thing alllllll the time. My catastrophising literally gets to the point I fantasize about suicide. Again... I know this sounds ridiculous. Reasons i posted it on a throwaway account. If anybody has any advice or something that might possibly help me relax it would be appreciated. I have multiple mental health issues and i truly feel like i cant take it anymore. 

Please don't judge me. I am already ashamed and feel extremely guilty."
Anxiety,"My anxiety got so bad in work today, I had to leave","My anxiety got so bad in work today that I had to leave, I had to stand and wait for orders, (I usually pick orders) and basically where I was standing had me in view of a lot people and I caught people staring at me and laughing at me.  I couldn't take it and left"
Anxiety,A little win,"So I'm in a band where for the most part it's the two of us, myself who is a multi-instrumentalist/songwriter and my mate who is a producer/songwriter. He is incredibly talented and it always intimidating to bring him stuff because my anxiety tells me I'm nowhere near good enough. Well it changed today.

For the past few months I've been writing an albums worth of songs, and since my city went back into lockdown I've decided to record demos of them all. I worked endlessly on them, from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed, but I never sent them to my mate no matter how much I wanted to.

Until today. After a long day I felt they were complete enough and, after bouts of hesitation, I sent them to him. Mind you I did have a few stressful moments waiting for his response but when he got back to me he was over the moon; fucking loved them.

I don't know what the point of writing this is but I feel fantastic right now, it's been a while since I've kicked my anxiety like that. Hope you're all doing well, stay strong xx"
Anxiety,Social anxiety or anxiety poop there must be something I can do or some support,Ever since I was a child going to school I used to run to the toilet every day 3 times or more before going. But in the last 2 years I noticed it getting worse when i book appointments for the doctor or to get my hair cut even if I plan on meeting up with friends in life or zoom my stomach gets nervous and I can’t stop pooping. When I do things unexpectedly like go to the shop it doesn’t bother me. I also take antidepressants they help with my depression but not with my anxiety. The pain and all the running to the toilet when it happens i feel like never leaving the house again.  Ive tried meditation before meetings and appoiments but it doesent really help any advice would be appreciated.
Anxiety,people i care about the most tends to lie infront of me,"i gave everything i have with no regrets especially to those people i cared about the most. i gave my time. the only thing that i can do to make a physical contact with them. i support them always but sometimes when i forgot, they made me feel like im biased to a different circle of friends or something. i always buy stuffs and foods for them. i never complain or think twice when i'm doing this. 'cause all that i can ever think is that they deserve it. they deserve my love, time, and affection. that i can go down deep to save them. without regrets.

but it all boils down when things get rough. i don' t know why it's not always reciprocal. i just want them to stay and stay a little longer in my life. i didn't wish for anything. i want them to know that they can trust me enough to be a comfort zone. that they can be vulnerable around me. but why? why do they even have to lie about things infront of me?? why can't they just not tell me and not make any dumb excuses??? to make me feel better? idk why. i don't wanna please them but for pete's sake, don't make any excuses just to get away with me.

i said it before, they can tell me directly if they're not comfortable or any opinion that wouldn't invalidate their feelings. what's hard with that? it's like the same scenario but with different people. people i cared the most in my entire life.

but at the end of the day, after all these exhausting things going around and around and around in my head and making me feel anxious, there's one thing that i want to hear from them with this question:


WHO AM I TO YOU?"
Anxiety,Anxiety and intrusive thoughts. -Intrusive thoughts trigger-," I(22M) don’t really know where to begin. I am feeling extremely lost. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and some traits of depression about 14 days ago. Yet, I have been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 11-12. I have been on Escitalopram(10mg) for 14 days now and I don’t really know if this is a side effect but anxiety and intrusive thoughts became extremely intense. I had really bad mental breakdowns yesterday and today. There are a lot of things that trigger my intrusive thoughts. For example, watching or reading something about serial killers or criminals trigger intrusive thoughts about ""what if I committed a crime? What if I killed someone? What if I grew up eventually to become a serial killer?"" And if I watch or read something about domestic violence, intrusive thoughts come to my head about what if I hurt a future partner? or what if  I hurt a future kid? And lots and lots and lots of other things that trigger different kinds of intrusive thoughts. During my mental breakdown yesterday and today I thought about what’s the point of my life anymore if I have this kind of thoughts in my system. I feel like I can’t fix this. How can I know that I can fix this? For what I know it’s not fixable and that puts me through hell. My next appointment with my therapist is 18 days from now. It's getting really hard, folks. I don't know if I can deal with this anymore."
Anxiety,Can’t quit my job,"I’ve had this job for about 3 months and I’ve decided to quit. I want to call my boss to tell her  (meeting in person is not possible) but, I just can’t get myself to. I’ve been trying for about a week now and every time I think about it my heart starts racing and I get so anxious. I feel bad for leaving after so little time, especially because she is a truly great boss. Any advice on how to make a phone call you don’t want to? I’ve considering just sending an email but that feels really unprofessional."
Anxiety,Job suggestions for people with mental illness,"Hi guys, been diagnosed with panic disorder and depression for a few years. I feel like I can’t work no more. I have quite some savings but if I don’t work in the long run, it’s not going to be sustainable. Just curious, any suggestions of job opportunities that are suitable for people with mental illness? Or any advice on how to cope with work. At this point, I don’t even mind a low pay and simple life, just enough to pay the bills and get food on the table"
Anxiety,"Please reassure me, I’m feeling burned by the one person I thought understood","My dad has narcissistic qualities though I’m not sure if I think he’s 100%. Long story short, he had it out for my brother growing up, he emotionally abused him. I got it too but it was more in the form of helicoptering and not trusting me (ridiculous curfews, being accused of sneaking around with boys, etc). So my bro thinks I had a better experience growing up while I really didn’t, it was just different. 

Today I was pissed because my mom and I had a beach day planned, dad called up last minute and said he wants to go. Every time we go anywhere with him it gets ruined because he takes hours to leave, he finds something to be mad about, etc. so I vented to my brother about it and he actually told me “you’d better take that back because he’s the reason you’re alive and he could have treated you a lot worse. If you won’t take it back I’m not talking to you anymore.” I’m sorry, are you kidding me!? My dad literally tried to kick my brother out at 16 and they have a rocky relationship as well. I thought my brother would understand of all people, and here I am feeling stupid like I never should have said anything because I’m supposed to be “grateful” that my dad wanted to go somewhere. My brother told me I would ruin my mom’s day by being upset, I’ll regret it when they die, etc. 

I left feeling like I’d just had a conversation with my dad, sad and guilty. I’m very disappointed by my brother’s response and told him that I won’t be bringing that subject up again. I’m 29 and he is 23 and I don’t understand how he can forgive my father so easily. Maybe it’s because I’m the older child and I know/see more? I thought I would be able to rely on him for this.. our relationship has gotten much better but I feel as if it just took ten steps back.

If anyone could offer me some perspective I would appreciate it."
Anxiety,I PROMISED A GUY SEX NOW IM TOO SCARED TO DO IT SHOULD I FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT?!?,"

Ok I haven’t had sex since early 2019 due to  being sick with ptsd , bipolar &amp; fibromyalgia and getting out of an abusive relationship but I feel like a loser it’s depressing I’ll be 27 next month and I don’t wanna have a boring summer but I’m scared to death to have sex ... I agreed to have sex with some guy that I met off tinder (we’ve never met in person before &amp; we’ve never talked on the phone) my impulses told me to ask him to have sex with me cause I was depressed but now my stomach is in knots my heart is pounding &amp; I’m nauseous should I still go through with this dick appointment to get it over with or nah?!?"
Anxiety,Does anyone else’s anxiety became unbearable when their getting their period?,"Yesterday I just couldn’t control myself so I screamed really loud. My panic attack doesn’t go away. My throat tightening is as bad as ever and it feels like my nose and mouth are stuffed with cotton balls. Literally like for days then when I finally “calm down” something else just triggers everything all over again. And it takes so long for the panic attack to go like it takes hours. 

For instance panic attack ensues at 1 pm.
I go jogging I manage to simmer down a tiny bit, I come back home and it’s the same thing. It lasts for hours. Now it’s the next day and I’m still having that same panic attack. 

This sucks cause for the past month I got a job (a stupidass one at that) but I quit and now I’m back in the same hell. Like it was really good for me to get out of the house, and panic attacks decreased by a million. 

Guys I don’t know what the hell to do sometimes. It feels like hell."
Anxiety,Literally sick to my stomach wanting to disappear more than anything from my anxiety,"I feel physically ill, like i need to puke and cry and just give up altogether, my body feels like it’s collapsing on the inside and i just can’t find the strength to move past this. Life doesn’t seem like something i want to keep experiencing if it means questioning and overthinking everything i do in life. The anxiety feels unbearable &amp; i just don’t know what to do anymore"
Anxiety,Anxiety around going blind,"Despite regularly getting my eyes checked and doctors telling me my eyes are completely normal. I have this constant anxiety about losing my eyesight. I just think about the impact it would have on my life if I were to go blind and I make myself scared for no reason. 
Has anyone else experienced the same anxiety. What did/do you do to help yourself?"
Anxiety,Drunken escapade,"It was my birthday yesterday. I turned 40. I had an amazing time and got really really drunk. I don't remember parts of the night.

Apparently during the night my friend arrived with her step daughter and sons and I told the oldest child 'to not fuck around'. My friend's husband is very upset about this and no longer wants her to be friends with me.

The problem is that our young 6/7 year old sons are friends. My son has a birthday coming up and the husband might be vindictive enough to say the boys can't play together anymore. I'm gutted for my son. I totally get I was in the wrong but I was drunk. I was having an awesome time."
Anxiety,Does anybody else’s anxiety makes walking really hard and not able to turn your head that much at all?,
Anxiety,replacement for alcohol ?,"any idea of a good replacement for alcohol?

my serotonin meds don't seem to help much with inhibition and anxiety like alcohol does, so is there any good replacement for it ?!

btw I'm not an alcoholic so a good above 5% beer of around 0.5l quantity usually does enough for me"
Anxiety,I'm struggling to maintain my job because of my superior.,"When she's not here I'm fine. I can get all of my work done and then some. I'm calm. It's quiet. 

When she's here she's distracting, always pulling others into minutes-long conversations that can always be conveyed with maybe a sentence or too. Simultaneously, she'll be rushing me to get work done. 

When she's not here, I make minimal mistakes. I have thought out processes, and can work at my own pace. 

When she's here, she throws me off by inserting herself into my task, derailing my train of thought, and I make avoidable mistakes that trigger my anxiety, anger, and apathy. Essentially, a single interaction will flip my positive mood on its head. 

I want to leave so desperately."
Anxiety,Uncontrollable shaking,"Hey, so I’m kinda new to reddit still but thought I post this here for some opinions. I’ve had anxiety for years but the thing that stops me from doing most things is uncontrollable shaking. Going to the shop to buy tobacco I’ll walk through the aisles and my legs will tremble, putting my card on the card reader my hands will shake and become clammy. I went to take my driving test roughly a year ago and I went to sign a form and my hand shook so badly I had to try my hardest just to put my signature down, whilst being laughed at by some random man. If you can relate to this how do you deal with it? No matter what I do if I’m even slightly anxious I start shaking, sorry for the length but It’s been getting to me lately and haven’t met anyone else yet who has to deal with this. Thanks."
Anxiety,Intrusive thoughts tips,"Hello, wondering if anybody has any tips for intrusive anxiety/thoughts/worries? Honestly trying not to think about it more just seems to make it so much worse and then I end up just feeling stuck/eating/humming loudly/doing rubbish things which don't really make me feel better and then feeling quite depressed.
Trying to think how to feel better when I feel terrible doesn't seem to help so I wondered if anybody has any ideas? I would just like my day to be able to continue after having anxiety and not have everything grind to an unbearable halt because I can't get rid of it."
Anxiety,i punch my arm so i wouldn’t scratched and pull and punch my face while i was having a attack,"it worked ,please don’t try this. i ran out of my play dough and i couldn’t stop punching, pulling on my cheeks and pulling my hair. find something safe to release your anxiety on"
Anxiety,anxiety following me in my dreams,i hate when i am sleeping and all of a sudden my dreams are just my anxious thoughts. i wake up more anxious than usual and have to calm myself down and remember it was just a dream. i wish my dreams did not have my anxious thoughts like i am already anxious enough when i am awake. please let me be at peace
Anxiety,what is the strangest thing you do to help with your anxiety?,"I get really bad anxiety at night and I can’t sleep, so I will watch Brad Mondo on YouTube. He’s a hairdresser and has a huge series where he reacts to people dyeing or cutting their own hair, hair life hacks, people using products from his business, etc. for some reason, his videos calm me and they’re also really entertaining."
Anxiety,"I need a hug, also to vent.","I was complaining to my parents how I wanted to eat, (my second meal of the day at midnight) but I knew we were both going to be disappointed in me if I did.

Of course it started a big argument where my mother felt the need to defend herself, and my father stayed silent except to remind me to be respectful.

I tried talking about how it’s hard for me with my depression and anxiety, (undiagnosed unmedicated because money,) to wake up at noon and only get the motivation to eat at dinner time. And then to have my desire to eat shot down by my parents because it’s unhealthy. (Really? I didn’t know!)

So then my mom rebutted me and said all of it is my choice. I choose to let my struggles rule my life. (I barely have the motivation to continue life.) Apparently it’s all a choice that I wake up and make every day. And I need to grow up and get a job because I’m now an adult. (I would like to!)

Anyway, it all ended with my mom telling me that she never wanted to start an argument over food. And to, “shut up.” (And I can hear my mom bitching to my dad about me. And now she’s laughing, probably about how unreasonable I am.) Probably the worst part is that in a few minutes she’s going to come in my room and act all apologetic for yelling. But that’s all she’ll apologize for, if she does at all. And my father will ignore the problem and take her side like a good husband.

So, now I’m in my room crying and complaining to the internet anonymously because I can’t talk to anyone about this. And I guess I’m also doing this to block out my intrusive thoughts about h@rm that get increasingly hard to ignore when I’m breaking down. 

It will probably be “fine” by tomorrow anyway. But thanks for reading if you got this far. &lt;3"
Anxiety,DAE write out multiple paragraphs only to think better of it and delete it?,"I just spent like a half an hour writing out multiple paragraphs in this sub to work out an anxiety attack that I was having because I came across r/parentsarefuckingstupid and the posts were heartbreaking, only to finish writing and read and reread it then felt paranoid that someone was going to judge me or make me feel bad so i ended up deleting it, not that you guys would that's just more of my multiple layers anxiety."
Anxiety,Trigger Warning: Childhood abuse. Is anyone else intensely afraid of the dark?,"Does anyone else have a crippling fear of the dark/night's alone? I'm fine when I sleep next to my husband or with anyone around but if I have to spend a night alone it's a real struggle. I usually have to keep the lights on and even then my mind never truly relaxes and I basically just stay awake in fear until I pass out from exhaustion. 
During these nights, I am scared of real life things like someone breaking in while I'm alone and also not so real things like ghosts and memorable characters from horror movies that I've watched in the past. 

I was sexually abused as a child and I often wonder if this is consequential. Or just a separate delightful aspect of my anxiety. 

Sending love to each and every one of you."

Anxiety,Who else has acid reflux with anxiety?,"I have it mildly, so the specialist says. I don’t really get heart burn or indigestion but just the acid reflux. I always feel a gurgling sound back of my throat, is that acid coming up? and is that what’s causing my throat to break, get sore and sound hoarse all the time. I also notice phlegm at the back from time to time too!"

Anxiety,My girlfriend has anxiety,"And i am the least worried person in the universe. I need to understand her.

For instance, what should i say when she talks about something she is worried?"
Anxiety,new meds can’t sleep,"I lost my clonazepam and was up all night last night and my new psychiatrist sent hydroxyzene to the pharmacy.

Anxiety,Why do I sometimes feel like I’m melting?,"There’s this really weird reaction that happens to me sometimes, almost always early in the morning after a really confusing Dream.

I’ll think too hard about the dream, get disoriented, and get this feeling like there’s something I just can’t comprehend, just beyond my grasp. I get so disoriented thinking about it that I get hit with strong anxiety, and this bizarre melty or liquidy sensation under my skin. The only way to describe it is how the top layer of hard candy dissolves in your mouth. 

It only lasts a minute or two, but it leaves me wandering about my apartment struggling to make my brain work, and it’s come on so quickly and so strong before that I threw up.

Anyone else know what I’m talking about? Does this have a name? I really haven’t been able to find much online about it, but would like to understand what’s up."

Anxiety,Celexa for agoraphobia,"I posted this elsewhere but didn’t get a whole lot of help or really any responses so I’m gonna post it again. 

I’ve suffered from anxiety/agoraphobia for the past 8 years, it started off not being able to go into the back of stores, then not being able to drive of main roads because the fear of having an attack in the middle of traffic, that eventually subsided slightly and I was able to drive around again, now here we are months later I’m stuck at home, I’m afraid to go far from home I can drive across the street at 2am because there are no cars out I’ve been trying it for my exposure therapy and the thought of having to try and go further than that completely terrifies me, I was on medication (Zoloft) when I was 18 for maybe 1 week and the side effects were unbearable I had to stop it, now I want to try Celexa after years of being anti medication because of the side affects I feel like this is my only hope to have a normal life again because I’ve tried all the remedies, all the techniques and I feel like this is my last answer I need to get better. Does anyone have advice on starting medication and sticking to it? I’m so irrational that I feel once I take the first pill that I’m going to freak out and want to throw it up I’m so scared of it making me feel different or feel like a zombie or make me feel high that I won’t be able to handle it, I know I just have to push through the first few weeks if I really want my life back but I’m so scared."
Anxiety,Anxiety about choosing clothes,"I really struggle to get dressed in the morning because I have such indecision and issues around picking and wearing clothes. It’s always like oh that’s too ugly, that won’t go with that, people will think I look boring, people will think you look weird in that, you look fat in that, you look frumpy in that, that colour is too dark, that colour is too light, you look like a boy in that, you look like a middle aged woman in that, you’re way too fat for that outfit, you wore that yesterday, that’s too unflattering, men will think you’re asking for it in that, no man will ever look at you in that etc etc etc. It’s becoming impossible to get dressed and I often just wear the same safe outfit all the time which is jeans and a black jumper or hoody. I’m mentally exhausted from it. I dread going outside or having to wake up because I just don’t want to get dressed. Does anyone else experience this?"
Anxiety,Workplace anxiety?,"Does anyone have tips on how to deal with workplace anxiety?

I started a new job just over 2 months ago and I feel like I’m still struggling almost every day with anxiety. To be fair this is the first job I’ve had in almost a year and I’ve also just moved cities. During my spare time my anxiety is so fine, I’ve been super social and happy when I’m with friends but my anxiety always hits me when I go to work. And I’m there for 40 hours a week too which is a huge amount of time to feel this awful. 

I think it’s the idea that I’m stuck in this place for 8 hours a day and if my IBS flares up, I can’t just go home. And then the nausea and throat tightness kicks in. I’ve only had one panic attack since starting but it’s just always that underlying feeling of anxiety. Any tips welcome!"
Anxiety,22 years old and keep quitting jobs,"I am 22 years old. I have been working since I was 16 and never been unemployed for a long period of time. The longest I've stayed at a job was just a few months over a year.

I have had a few jobs now - I quit all of them except 1 where I was let go. I just get so up in my head with anxiety that I end up feeling miserable and needing to quit. Spend all the time out of the job crying and on the verge of tears the whole working day - feeling sick to my stomach.

I've never known what I wanted to do for a living, I just wanted enough money to pay for the things I enjoy like gaming and my pets. Every job has given me this yet I still become increasingly unhappy that now I think I'm just not cut out for the working world but unfortunately I'm not rich or famous so I have no choice.

The jobs make me anxious when I don't know what's going to happen or I don't know what I'm doing so everytime I start a new job I get anxious about learning it - it's a cruel cycle.

I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and I tried therapy but again - I quit it or I quit my job, felt good and left therapy coz I was fine until the next one.

What can I do? Am I a completely lost cause? I feel so alone in this."
Anxiety,I am scared to death that the economy is going to collapse.,"Gas is rising, I keep reading about shortages and inflation and TBH, this has the potential to be way scarier than covid (at least for me)  Can anyone with any knowledge about this help me not spiral out of control?  It's getting to be really hard."
Anxiety,Just had a 5 minute conversation over the phone with the doctor. Worst experience of my life.,"I have just moved to a new area and my anxiety had flared up again. I decided to book a telephone consultation with my new doctor to discuss some options. As many of you know, it takes more than 3 minutes to describe symptoms.

I explained my blood pressure is an issue as I can not stand up without going dizzy and my veins pop out of my hands on a regular basis, suggesting unregulated blood pressure. The doctor snapped 'there is no way for you to know that, you need to come in and get checked' yeah I know this. You told me to do it over the phone. 

I then talked about my palpatations and he offered me a number for CBT. I explained CBT did not work when I last tried, I again explained about my issues with being social for the doctor to tell me I'm repeating myself. 

Tried telling him I do not feel comfortable in my own home and going out, he cuts me off and says he is sending me a prescription, didn't say what for didn't say the name of the meds or anything.

I feel like I have just been pushed through some machine and come out doped up. I wanted a conversation and now it's a safe bet I will never call that asshole of a doctor again. Thanks for that."

Anxiety,I’m worried I might die today,"One of our employees just stopped coming to work last week. He has at least $2600 worth of equipment that I am directly responsible for. His manager let him know if he didn’t bring it back he would be charged and the police would be involved. He threatened his manager and also has PTSD from the being in the Marines or something. I don’t think his mental state is right, and I’m aware that he’s been on a drinking binge since last week. His manager acts like he isn’t concerned but brought his gun in with him today. This may be irrational, but I am worried that when confronted with a man who is mentally unstable, probably drunk, and also has access to weapons might act irrationally."
Anxiety,Does anyone else dread spending time with their family?,"I dread spending time with my family. I have nothing against my family. I have no legitimate reason to. I simply dont get along with them and i dont enjoy their company, like when you are forced in a group project with students you never talk to because you dont get along, thats what it feels like. In life we usually have a choice who we spend time with and are friends with but with family its different, i cant just pick and choose who im blood related to. In social situations i feel so pressured to speak and be present. Im still young and live at my moms house, just me and her and she often goes to see her boyfriend so im alone most of the time, when she is home i feel no pressure to be social and be her company. I feel comfortable and relaxed knowing i can stroll around and do my thing. 

Tomorrow is my grandpas birthday and i happily see him and grandma to wish him happy birthday. Im okey spending an hour or so with family, but when it gets to 5..6..7 hours of keeping up i cant stand it. The fake smile hurts my jaw and gives a throbbing headeache which is probably when the anxiety is taking over. Not knowing what to say, fake laughing at their jokes, listening to their gossip, pretending im feeling fine and like i want to be there is awful. And then knowing my dad and his girlfriend is taking me to their house afterwards so i can stay over extends that even more. Its not like moms house, there i feel fine, comfortable in my bubble. Going to dads house is like im ”going to see dad” i feel like i have to constantly show face and be present and keep a conversation up and going and be entertaining 24/7 and i cant help but dread the fact this is my last day of peace until i have to spend a full day socialising, potentially even longer because im taken to dads house. When i know times like this are coming up i spend the full time coming up to it feeling moody, stressed out and close to tears because i know how emotionally draining it is and how badly i want it over with before its even started. When holidays are over i usually go in my room and cry, with thoughts of how weird, lonely, misunderstood and drained i feel takes over at that point. I hate to see people take it personal, i see how it looks that way when i never visit my dad for example, but its really not. I have nothing against anybody its just so emotionally draining and i have always felt like an outsider like the black sheep in my family, it gives me anxiety like the last thing i want is to be in that moment. Im sure somebody can relate to this. What can i do in situations like this, when all i really want is go lay down in someones bedroom i cant just do that without looking like an asshole. I cant just leave or escape the scene but i feel dumb sitting there completely silent with a throbbing headache close to tears with a big fake smile on my face. I dont know which is worse to not show up, to deal with it for an hour just to show face and then slowly get away from the scene like sit in another room, or to feel like an idiot, silent with crippling anxiety at the dinner table where it all happens but look somewhat polite and normal for blending in. Who knows."

Anxiety,Natural ways to reduce anxiety?,"Hello!

Just wondering if anyone has a tip on how to naturally reduce anxiety ?

For example I have been drinking alcohol to help with my panic attacks etc for the last 3 years .. but recently I've noticed the alcohol makes me more anxious (which it had never done before). It also gives me horrendous panic attacks at 4 in the morning. Can I take a vitamin or increase exercise??? what can I do to manage it because if I dont drink alcohol I struggle with irritability and anger issues."

Now I’m not sure what to do. I know I need to eat. I’m started to feel so weak. But I’m afraid to as well. It’s like a lose lose when it comes to my anxiety.

I hate constantly feeling this way and I don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like it’s just getting worse. I just want to feel normal."
Anxiety,I recently bumped into my sister again 😱🔥,I’ve been on anxiety meds for a while now but my anxiety seems to spike around my family I’m almost sick all the time and I feel less human :( I can’t just stop seeing my family because of a few bad things. Family is forever and they have always been there for me ❤️ I just think I have some PTSD left over from my teenage years.
Anxiety,Should I get help?,"I’m nervous whether or not to go see someone about my anxiety, I think it has slowly gotten worse and worse but  I don’t want to be one of those people that ‘self-diagnoses’ and wastes peoples time.

Since I started Uni I think my anxiety has doubled down, I have no friends cause I’m too scared to talk to anyone, I skip seminars cause the fear of going in overwhelms me and in lectures I’ll purposely find the most isolated spot in the room to sit so I both don’t have to talk to anyone and won’t get asked questions. I keep having these horrible feelings of dread and overwhelming fear that feels like it comes from a core part of me, I’ll travel to uni on the train, walk to the uni building and stand outside in an isolated spot struggling to catch my breath and having those feelings until I eventually just walk away and wander around until the next train gets back so I can leave, and then I’ll lie to people saying I actually went in.

I’ve also finally recently got my first job after applying for ages and on my first shift I found myself in the bathroom like 6 times having those same feelings of dread and overwhelming fear, pacing back and forth breathing heavily. I stand there awkwardly while everyone around me talks to each other and I’m too scared to join in incase I mess up or say the wrong thing.

I don’t know if those feelings of dread and shortness of breath are panic attacks but I’m hesitant to label them that. But I think it’s really starting to affect my life as I’m struggling in uni and I’ve had to quit my first ever job cause I’m too scared to go back. 

Should I go to the doctors and ask about it or am I just overreacting to things that everyone has? Are there any reliable tests I can do see if I need to get further help?"
Anxiety,Constant anxiety over my brother’s future is wearing me down.,"My older brother is a good person, and I know that. He’s never gotten in trouble at school, he’s been praised at work, he’s respectful, he’s friendly, etc. However, he struggles in school a lot, especially with the pandemic. This is driving me nuts. It seems like all I can think about these days are “is he going to be successful” “is he going to be homeless in the future” “will he be able to get a professional career”. In the past week, I’ve lashed out twice at my brother and my mom in moments of panic. Of course I’ve apologized afterwards and felt immense regret, but that doesn’t change the fact that I feel like I’m becoming a menace to my own family.

The worst part is that I’m worried about the future. Something I can’t control. I tried reading stories about people who struggled in school but were still able to go somewhere in life, but that only calms my nerves for a little bit before I go back to constantly worrying. It seems to be the only thing on my mind these days and I’m tired of it. I stay up late at night to tire myself out so I don’t fall asleep thinking of the future. I feel like they’re is a constant weight on my chest and I want it to just go away so I can breathe and relax. But I can’t. And it’s scary. I don’t want to live the rest of my teenage life like this.

It also doesn’t help that I don’t do much nowadays, so I have so much time to just think. And I really want to just stop thinking. 

All I’m asking for is some advice on what I should do and how I should make myself feel better. I hate the thought of spending my time like this."
Anxiety,Trying to find words to describe the physical 'foggy' sensation I feel when I'm in bouts of big anxiety. Anyone else experience this?,"Anxiety comes and goes, is big sometimes and small sometimes. I'm trying to learn how to identify where my anxiety is in a given moment, and my therapist recently asked ""what physical sensations are clues?""

I get this feeling of what I can only describe as 'fog'. Like my brain is underwater and needs to work extra hard to make connections. Like my eyes need to work extra hard to really see things. Like I have to remember sometimes ""these surroundings I'm seeing right now, I'm here too. I'm not just looking at things- I'm *here*"". 

I don't mean in a literal sense; things don't actually look fogged over, but that's the best way I can describe the feeling so far. I'm having a really hard time finding a more articulate/accurate way to describe this sensation, so I thought I'd see if anyone else experiences something similar and can help put words to it?"
Anxiety,.25mg/day for three week of Klonopin.,"Hi everyone! I was recently prescribed a dosage of .25mg/day of klonopin for three weeks. and before I take it, I have been really wanting some information on whether or not I will have withdrawal symptoms after the three weeks? I don’t want to put myself in a bad situation considering I already have pretty bad anxiety. Anyone who has any insight or experience on this, would be very helpful cuz I don’t plan to fill my prescription after this three weeks.

Anxiety,Citalopram/ SSRIs,"I went to see a new psychiatrist yesterday for an evaluation and she prescribed me trazadone for sleep and citalopram for anxiety. I have taken SSRIs before and I don’t care for them. They wreck my sex drive and when I do have a sex drive, I cannot orgasm. My anxiety is bad at night and I have been through years of therapy to be able to cope with panic attacks etc. I haven’t had a panic attack in 6 months and given the state of our world I think that’s pretty damn good. I’m definitely not depressed. I’m not suicidal, and I’m not self harming. It seems extreme to me to be put on an SSRI when in all honesty, I feel like I’m handling my anxiety well. My blood pressure is low, my weight is healthy, I’m not having panic attacks. My biggest issue is sleep, but the trazadone should help with that. I plan on calling her back today and asking to not take the ssri, but I’m afraid that will label me somehow as being unwilling to be treated. I just really don’t want to take medications. The whole reason I did the evaluation is for a diagnosis so I can learn some more diagnosis-specific coping strategies for whatever is wrong with my noggin. Do you have experience with SSRIs and anxiety? I have read several studies showing that people with chronic anxiety often have *higher* levels of serotonin rather than lower?"
Anxiety,Introvert thing or anxiety thing order both,"I'm definitely an introvert. I definitely have anxiety.

I really value my alone time and I prefer to be alone like 80% of the time. I've noticed I get a load of sensory issue symptoms when I'm not alone for a few days at a time or when my anxiety is bad and it kinda makes me a bitch?

I've noticed when I'm having these days and it seems to be more often than not that I really don't wanna be touched or cuddled and I get frustrated when mt partner tries to touch me most of the time, and I feel bad but I just can't handle it. Anyone else deal with this ?"

Anxiety,This passage from Rilke’s Book of Hours: Love Poems to God always helps me in my hardest times. Maybe it can help you too.,"God speaks to each of us as he makes us,
then walks with us silently out of the night.

These are the words we dimly hear:
You, sent out beyond your recall,
go to the limits of your longing.
Embody me.

Flare up like a flame
and make big shadows I can move in.

**Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.
Just keep going. No feeling is final.**
Don’t let yourself lose me.

Nearby is the country they call life.
You will know it by its seriousness.
Give me your hand."
Anxiety,"How To Recover After ""Traumatising"" Event While Waiting For Meds?","I've come a long way in understanding my anxiety, mainly because of meditation and countless self-help books and videos. I've always been prone to anxiety, but this current episode has been worse than anything before and has lasted over 6 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I set myself a deadline: since much of my anxiety has stemmed from stomach problems and I dreaded my upcoming colonoscopy, I decided to only try meds if my mood doesn't get better after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though my colonoscopy went fine and nothing truly traumatising happened, it was my first experience with hospitals and I felt so,  so awful during it. I spent 24h sitting on toilet floor, panicking. I can't stop thinking about it and I feel like my ""inner child"" is still crying after it. It's been three days and my anxiety is horrible. Small things cause lots of distress, sofa is my only safe place and going outside horrifies me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been diagnosed with GAD, and I think I have tendency to emetophobia, agoraphobia and hypochondria. I have a prescription for escitalopram. Since starting SSRI can cause nasty side effects, I plan to start it after the next week, since my school will be over then and I have no responsibilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I could do to get over this experience, to feel more normal again? Anything to ease the situation before I can try medication? (and I know, it will take few weeks before even that will help, if it will at all. I am pretty confident it will though. )"
Anxiety,"Anxiety about Brood X, anyone?","Anyone else just absolutely terrified of the cicadas coming soon? How do you cope with something so uncontrollable as billions of 1-2 inch bugs suddenly outdoors *everywhere?*

Anxiety,Tired of anxiety and how it has isolated me,"This is a mild rant. I have had anxiety my whole life but it has always been manageable until recently. About a three years ago I was in a terrible relationship that was emotionally and physically abusive. He made me a ball of depression and anxiety. He destroyed my friendships and tried separating me from my parents the best that he could. I tell myself alot that what I went through wasn't terrible and that it shouldn't of affected me like this. It was a short relationship and I didn't end up dead like some women do in these situations. I also blame myself a lot still for what I went through. 

Its been so long since then and to be honest I didn't get the help that I should have. It felt like every relationship I had was now destroyed and my anxiety told me I would only be a bother if I tried being friends with them again. I was a terrible friend when I was with him and I couldn't get myself to even try to face them to apologize. There is a lot of shame there and fear or rejection. I wanted to try so bad but now I feel like it is to late. 

I am finally getting back on track mentally. I am feeling a lot better. I want to try and make friends again. I am lonely. I do have a new boyfriend who is wonderful and supportive. I love hanging out with him but I miss having friends like I used to. I feel like I rely on him too much you know? But everytime I want to try my anxiety shuts me down. It's frustrating. I used to be able to talk to anyone with no problem really. Now though I consistently feel the guilt of being a bad friend in the past and the worry of rejection. I do try somewhat online but it feels like I am annoying them. 

I miss how I used to be. I miss being confident and social. I miss having my friends. I want to get back to that. I know these things take time but it is not coming soon enough for me. I want to be myself again. Sometimes I don't even recognize myself. Its like I am a different person, a scared person. I hate how lonely it has made me become. The most interaction I get is from my boyfriend and the occasional comment online. I just want one friend and I can't even get myself to try."
Anxiety,Exam stress for another 4 months :(,Did my A level biology test today and did terribly I can just tell. I don’t think I’ve passed and I need a C to get into nursing school. My results day isn’t until August so now it’s just a big long anxious wait to see if I can actually go to university this year. This year has been really awful for me mental health wise and my grades took a big hit :(
Anxiety,"It's so frustrating when society wants to be all ""mental health awareness"" but when it comes to the actual symptoms of anxiety and other mental illnesses or being slightly low functioning, you're suddenly condemned for showing them","The company that I worked for: ""Hey it's mental health week! Here is a pdf on how to treat others with kindness and always be mindful of others and what they might go through!""

The company after mental health week: ""Oh what? You're overwhelmed with stress and you're showing side effects of the workload you're carrying while panicking and taking a breather? Meet me at the office after work because this behaviour is unacceptable and unprofessional compared to your neurotypical co-workers that can carry the job normally."""
Anxiety,Brother with mental health problems constantly giving me a hard time,"So my brother is 4 years older than me and has been suffering with anxiety and OCD for the past 15 years. He’s never really held down a job and takes things out on me a lot. For example, when I was at college he used to take my laptop and wouldn’t let me have it, even even I had urgent things to do on it. He threatened to rip up my prom dress, he’s broken my laptop, he used to listen to things really loudly in his room the night before my final year exams at university and shout and swear at me if I asked him to turn it down. 

Mt parents had no idea how to handle him as he flies off the handle at the slightest thing. So as a result, they used to give me the brunt of it and make it out like I was the one at fault for ‘saying or doing the wrong thing’. However, I could literally walk past him and he’ll get angry with me. He does see a psychologist but it seems he gets envious of other people living life and doing things, which I sympathise with but I can’t say he endears himself to me when he treats me so badly. I also have my own struggles and issues to deal with myself but he doesn’t seem to care. My parents have paid out a lot for me, bought him driving lessons, two trips to Australia (where he used my parents credit card to book a seat in business class as he couldn’t hack the long haul flight), they also give him free reign of the car, which means he gets first dibs if he wants to use it. 

I’m just tired of being treated like it and he seems to kid himself about what he’s really like. At the moment I’m at home but I really don’t know what his future is. He keeps threatening suicide but he’s receiving help. I just feel like he’s not pushing himself to get better. Any ideas? Thank you."
Anxiety,Had to take a sick leave and my boss told me this is not a reason to not come to work,"This got me anxious even more, I feel like he is right, even if my therapist told me it would br for the best. I feel guilty but it's already been done but I can't calm down. I'm gonna be on new meds tommorow and I hope they will help me a little bit."
Anxiety,What are my options?,"So I've recently come to terms with the idea that I most likely have anxiety. For years I've been frequently cold and shaky despite it actually being warm, and I never really feel comfortable - not when I sleep, not in the shower, not in my bedroom, not even on the toilet. It's the same in social situations as it is when I'm in my house. It's increased particularly due to a couple events recently where I have been threatened and physically assaulted by the same group twice.

I very much want help with this. In-person help very much ideally. I went to my GP early last year because I felt anxious, and I described to him how I was suicidal, how I've attempted before, how I always feel anxious, how I spent 20% of my time away from school in Year 11 because I didn't feel confident enough to go in. He told me to write down my feelings and burn the paper after, and sent me a text to a charity called OTR. Here's the issue - the former solution helps in the short-term but doesn't actually stop my anxiety, and the latter solution has a wait list up to, and maybe surpassing, a year.

I can talk to my parents, I can talk to my girlfriend, but neither are completely helpful. I'll be honest, I've not given my parents much of a chance to help - they don't even know I've felt suicidal in the past. I guess I'm worried of disappointing them or worrying them since all of my siblings bar one has had the same issues and I hate to see my mum worry. My girlfriend, whilst she might try her best, isn't great at comforting. I've tried to help teach her how to comfort me but it's going to be a long process.

I am in college, and so I'm sure I could get counseling there, but I'm in college 3 times a fortnight. I'm not 18 so I don't even qualify for therapy provided by the NHS. 

I really do need help. I don't want to keep feeling like this, nor do I want it to ever get worse again. I just don't know what my options are. I've tried dietary changes, I've tried cutting caffeine (I was off caffeine for 4 months over a year back after years of drinking &gt;10 cups of coffee a day most days, not even soft drinks, and it had no effect), I've tried exercise. What else can I do?"
Anxiety,So yeah,"
I started to notice I had anxiety in middle school. It's slowly been getting worse and worse. I feel myself just slip from reality and it's like I can't go back. I use to be so talkative no shame no fear. All these racing thoughts all the time I can never make it stop. I can't even get help anymore all the doors in life are closing I'm missing all my chances.  My confidence is gone I pretty much am mute. Sorry I dont know where I'm going anymore"
Anxiety,I want to reunite with my toxic friend to punish myself,"It’s a long story, so I’ll just cut it short. One of my toxic friends from the past has been making fake accounts on Instagram to try and trick me so I talk to them.

I’ve been ignoring them, granted I’ve only gotten 2, but when I get another one I want to just go along with it. Recently I’ve been thinking about how shitty of a person I used to be in elementary school. I hurt my dog when she barked and bit at me every now and then, I was mean to one of my friends because I couldn’t let get of 
a grudge, and was just a very weird person in general.

All the bad things I did I think corralled to my anger. I had no idea how to deal with it in any healthy way, and to this day my only method is to scream into a pillow. 

I’ve made amends for most of the stuff I’ve done, but all the stuff I can’t make amends for are bothering me. 
I just feel a tad selfish ignoring these messages. It was a living nightmare talking to them, and I don’t want to go through that again, but maybe I deserve it?

As long as I’m writing this I want to just say some obvious things: please please please don’t hit your dog since it’s harmful and not a good training technique, and forgive people who have changed :)"
Anxiety,help,"I have an anxiety disorder and it causes extreme nausea in every possible situation. I throw up almost daily if I have to leave the house. Zofran worked at first but I’m nearly immune at this point, plus it’s nearly impossible to get my hands on. Cars, planes, restaraunts, heat, tight clothes, everything puts me in a disabling state of nausea. I don’t know what to do anymore, the medication they’ve tried is useless. I’m only 16 I can’t bring myself to the doctors, and plus they don’t take me seriously enough to prescribe me anything besides rebranded benadryl. I’m miserable, I can’t even attend school. I need advice"
Anxiety,I do not have anxiety my self but my girlfriend does and I would like to be as supportive as possible. How could I do that?,"Me (17M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been together for seven months. She is a very shy person and keeps everything to her self. Now she started to push me away and distance her self. We have mentioned on it and it is due to her anxiety she said, I don’t want to push and set her anxiety off big time and I’m being patient. How can I help her become close again and understand that she can see me and tell me anything at anytime. I want to be that one person she can trust and have there for her. But I don’t know what anxiety is like and how to help her and work with it. What can I do?"
Anxiety,Haven’t been able to sleep,The past couple of nights I haven’t been able to sleep. I start thinking I’m so behind in life when it comes to finding the “one”. I thought I found my person but we ended up calling the wedding off. It hasn’t helped that all my friends are getting married or having babies. I feel like I’m barely surviving and I’m happy for all of them but it’s giving me such bad anxiety that it’s keeping me up at night. No one knowns how bad it’s been because every single time I fake a smile. The not knowing is what keeps me up at nights and I’m okay with being alone but then I start thinking “man I’m so behind what if I don’t accomplish everything I want in life”.
Anxiety,Leaving work for the 100th time,"I don’t really have a true point in posting this I guess but to let things out. Today I had to leave work AGAIN after leaving last week and a couple weeks before that because I had another panic attack. I was put on medicine two years ago that was working really well but just recently within the last couple months I could feel me slipping deeper into my anxiety. I’ve had the worst panic attacks I’ve ever had in my life and it’s been a cluster of them lately. I feel bad about leaving work because I feel they really don’t understand that I cannot control how my brain is firing. It really just goes straight to feeling completely doomed for almost no reasoning, like over someone simply ignoring me or little things that shouldn’t really trigger such a reaction out of me.  In two weeks I have my first therapy appointment and my doctor has upped my medicine and has given me something for when I do have panic attacks. However, the anxiousness inside me is still so concerned about having to leave work, even though that’s what I know I had to do for ME. I wish I could shake not caring too much because I know the company I work for doesn’t really care for me as a person. I don’t know I’m just feeling defeated right now."
Anxiety,Experiences with Gabapentin as Antidepressant &amp; Social Anxiety Medication,[removed]
Anxiety,What does it mean if you can prevent an anxiety attack?,"I decided to come here because I don't think I need therapy just yet. There are times when I feel like I'm about to have an anxiety attack, I would overload my brain with distractions until I'm exhausted enough to sleep. My symptoms would include: shaking, labored breathing, numbing arms and my brain feeling fuzzy or something. And so, everytime I would feel this symptoms arise, I'll overload my brain by multitasking (i.e. listening to a podcast while playing video games or watching a tv series while browsing online and doing some chores).

I don't know if that's normal or should I go and see a therapist about it. I would really appreciate your help. Thank you."
Anxiety,Anxiety after getting a vaccine,"Hey, today I got my Pfizer vaccine and a few seconds after i got it a started to feel really anxious. The first 15 minutes were really bad. I was so scared about getting an allergic reaction. In the next hour I almost got a panic attack (twice) because of that and now its been like 6 hours since the shot and im still fucking anxious about it. Not so much about an allergic reaction anymore but now Im scared of getting a blood cloth or something like that. And I think i will feel like this for a long long time. Fuck my brain for real."
Anxiety,Lexapro is a game changer!,"Hey guys or gals so I’m on day 11 of Lexapro and it is a game changer. I’ve had severe severe anxiety for about a year and everyday was a constant battle... I was afraid of the dark and couldn’t sleep earlier then 7am and it was destroying my social life.. I started taking Lexapro and the first week was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. My already debilitating anxiety was like 3x worse I was having a constant panic attack for hours out of each day. I was experiencing insomnia, upset stomach, dizziness, sweats etc. But I decided to stick it out because I know this can happen. Suddenly day 8 roles around I take my pill and something was different the side effects completely went away and I slept like 6 hours. Ever since day 8 everything has been getting better and the length of sleep is increasing. I’m struggling to figure out if it was completely the pill or the fact that I’m forcing myself to go for walks etc but my life has changed almost overnight... I’m going to sleep no later then 12 at night with minimal anxiety. Don’t get me wrong I still get a little anticipatory anxiety for the night but once it’s time I’m way to tired to give a crap.. just wanted to share my story for those struggling with the side effects and who are debating quitting I’m telling you stick it out!

Also sorry for the grammar not a great writer... I’m also a 21m and I’m taking 10mg daily."
Anxiety,damn it its back!,"I have a history of driving anxiety along with general anxiety.  I have been on meds for a while now for depression and anxiety..I was enjoying the respite from my anxiety in all areas but noticed I was at a point where I was apathetic.  I went down on one of my doses a couple weeks ago and...its back folks.  I spent all night fighting anxious thoughts about 2 errands today on opposite ends of the city and the time frame and my kids being in the car.  I woke up with it and yep I just gave in and canceled one of them.  now I feel guilty and like a failure. 
       I hate this with every fiber of my being"
Anxiety,Paranoid Thoughts Causing Me To Hear Voices.,"Iv heard voices for 3 years now. My paranoid thoughts are due to my (GAD).
I get paranoid thoughts a few times a day maybe 3 or 4 times a day and due to  being paranoid, that's when the voices come. It's crazy. The paranoid thoughts are causing the voices to be there. When the voices are there then that causes me to be more paranoid.
CRAZY!!
I'm paranoid right now and the voices are here now. I forgot to mention because the voices are (noise) it causes me to be more anxious and that's what triggers my anxiety as well is (noise)
I just don't know."
Anxiety,possible anxiety coping mechanism?,"hi. for reference yes I do have a diagnosed anxiety disorder idk just in case people are questioning. so ive noticed how good I am at just staring at particularly nothing, can this be a tic of sorts or a coping thing? like when im sad i can look head on or just at something in a certain angle but not exactly? i can stay that way staring at it for minutes but thinking nothing until i resume back to what’s going on or I feel like I’m “in the clear”. This also happens when im nervous and I just want to avoid awkward eye contact. 

can someone help me decipher this? thank you in advance"
Anxiety,How to stop feeling embarrassed for not knowing things at work?,"I’m in a new industry and a couple months in. I have learned a lot, but I get frustrated that I don’t understand everything immediately. 

I feel like if I ask my manager about something or a task, that I am supposed to have already known. Even if I know it’s a new thing to me. 

I was in my previous role for three years in a different industry. I knew a lot and remember the growing pains, but I was able to lean on being brand new to office work. Now I have a few years of general work experience, but feel so dumb and discouraged having to ask questions or not understand things. I know some level of this is normal, but I feel like I’m hurting my image &amp; sabotaging myself by asking. 

Any advice?"
Anxiety,Chest Pains,"Hello everyone,
Last year around October/November I had a big day recreationally using cocaine and ended up calling an ambulance thinking I was having a heart attack. 
Once in hospital they didn't give me much information but my bloods came back ok, chest Xray ok and they monitored me for around 5hrs and I was fine. 

That was enough to scare me and I haven't touched anything besides alcohol (rarely drink just socially) I even quit smoking. 

Since then I've been having chest pains on and off. Most days. As well as a heaviness in my right arm and a pain in my right leg that's sort of feels like an electric shock. ( lasts no more than 1 second)

I could be at work and happily doing a task im confident in when it hits me or I could be at home sitting on the couch watching TV when the pains occur. 

After multiple visits with my GP (I told him everything) he sent me to get an echocardiogram and that came back ok. I've also had an ultrasound and besides a slightly fatty liver (which he said isn't to worry about at the moment) everything is ok.
My blood pressure is a little elevated 130/82 at the doctors. However I monitor myself at home and usually under normal numbers.
He ended up prescribing me Mertazapine thinking I have anxiety (which I may have but im not convinced). 
I even went and saw a psychiatrist once but didn't feel like I was getting anything im generally a pretty positive and happy person, a problem solver and I feel happy. 

I was on mertazapine for at least 3 months and been to the ER 2 times with chest pains in that time. Once on my own while having chest pains at work and once by doctors orders after my description on my chest pains and family history worried him
Both times chest xrays and bloods came back ok.

While on mertazapine my pains never stopped and I was sleeping way too much, personality completely changed and gained so much weight probably at least 20kg. It honestly was not making me happy. 
I was late to work almost every day because I couldn't get enough sleep. 

I've stopped using it since I decided it wasn't for me. My GP told me to slowly dose off but I did it pretty quickly as I hated the person it made me. I've been off for around 3 weeks. 

My sharp leg pain is the one that mostly bothers me. It feels to me like a blocked artery but im no doctor. The chest pain and arm is mostly pretty dull but noticeable and it does worry me. 

Im just wondering if anyone else has been under any similar situation. Should I be pushing my doctor more towards something is wrong with my arteries/heart since my chest pain and leg pain hasn't stopped or should I be looking for a new anxiety medication?

Is there another test or something I can ask my doctor to do as the pain in my leg honestly feels to me like something is blocked up.

The mertazapine made me so unfit and has probably caused anxiety with the weight gain if anything. Weight is something I used to struggle with when I was younger and took me 10 years to loose the weight. I've gained the weight that took me 10 years to loose and keep off in a short time frame.

Anybody with any advice would be great.
Im honestly unsure if its just anxiety or if I may have a medical condition.

Thanks if you took the time to read all of this."
Anxiety,When to detox from social media?,"How did you know when it was time to detox from Facebook, Instagram, etc. I feel like I'm fine until I come across someone's post that upsets me and then I feel like if I hadn't been on that app in the first place, I wouldn't have seen it and been in a funk the rest of the day. 

Or more specifically if I post something that's not butterflies and rainbows (extremely rare), I get people coming out of the woodwork telling me it's inappropriate or asking why would I post something like that (when literally a dozen people in my friends list shitpost constantly with no repercussions). I'm just sick of the drama, everyone being so fake, politics and spam shares... 

However, it's the only way I can see certain small businesses that I buy from and a handful of people I stay in casual contact with.

Have you done a social media detox before? How did you do it? I don't know if I should just delete the app and be done or set a timer on my phone. Looking for ideas and similar stories. Thanks!"
Anxiety,"Guilt ridden as I still haven't done taxes, not sure where to find all the documents, but want to start a small outdoor hobby","Last year at my new job, I started feeding money into life insurance and other things thanks to this great job. I ended up furloughed then when I returned I was given two more months before being let go. Because of that some things like insurance were ended in November and I didn't get them started up again or really understood what I need to do. Now I have to gather documents for taxes and I'm having a hard time understanding where to start. I feel I could ask HR, but I'm afraid they're going to be pissed. I'm sure they'd be at least irritated, especially given the timing, but I can't get myself to do it or in which form. I could email them, but phrasing things is nerve racking.

I'm starting up a hobby of photographing nature, but the anxiety kicks in because taxes aren't done and I end of eating, watching shows, and playing video games instead. I'm on a couple needs, which have helped greatly with anxiety management but this is still so tough."
Anxiety,Is this normal after a breakdown?,"So 2 nights ago I had a intense breakdown from POCD. I was crying so hard I almost started shaking and felt like I was holding back blood curdling screams. Ever since then I haven’t felt like me. Every time I was up the day doesn’t feel real and feels like some alternate dream universe thing. I feel physically and mentally exhausted and I feel like I can’t react in the way I should. Today when I woke up intrusive images instantly hit my mind but I didn’t have as much anxiety that I normally have but I still hated the thoughts. Is this normal? And is it derealization or depersonalization?

If I could describe it it feels like I’m a imposter living inside my body almost pretending to be who I used to be. I feel like I just switched into a new person. Never before has OCD taken such a toll on me"
Anxiety,All advice welcomed,"I always had anxiety and depression my whole life and I'm in a bad spot right now. I work at a factory with a 2000+ employee so i have been struggling just to not be nervous or make myself look like a fool. The first year working there i was drinking and smoking almost everday by myself. I was crying in my car on my way home on somedays and speeding up to 140mph. One day i was working and some girl walked up out of nowhere and asked if i was okay. That for me hit me hard since i realized no one has asked me of if i was okay. I froze up talking to her and she left, i do this a lot. Im 28years old now and still find it hard to relax or not stress out. Its been about a year now working at the factory and tell this day she still trying to hold conversations with me. The problem is my anxiety is turned up to 10 when im at the factory. So its been hard for me to relax and im always tense or fidgeting with something. So when we talk its only about work, i just don't really know how to tell her that i have anxiety and workin at the factory is hard for me. I dont know what to do any advice will help thank you"
Anxiety,Scared of getting roofied while on antidepressants,"This is probably one of my most irrational fears, but still... i am taking 25 mg of ssri and i am super worried that whenever i am outside drinking someone might put something in my drink and I could get serotonin syndrome... would love to have some reassurance about this ://"
Anxiety,Anyone know how to stop the physiological symptoms of social anxiety?,"I have no issue with anxiety because my mind is strong and rational enough to not care, but for some reason my heart rate goes insane if I'm doing something important like a job interview or asking someone out on a date. It genuinely makes me feel like I'm gonna faint. 

I'm not stressed or worried, but I still feel this way. Is there anything I can do? Breathing exercises have absolutely failed me.

My mom would be very opposed to me taking any more medication, especially benzodiazepines. I already take 30mg of Adderall so I don't even know if taking beta blockers would even be possible."
Anxiety,Anyone else fear that their brain might “turn” on them? (Elaboration below),"So, I’ve been having this really strange fear recently which is COMPLETELY irrational, unfounded, and silly. I’m afraid of my brain somehow just going haywire one day and making me feel intense pain throughout my body for no reason, with no physical stimulus. It’s gotten to the point that I’m afraid that just thinking about this possibility could trigger it to happen. I understand logically that it doesn’t work like that - that you can’t just think crippling debilitating pain into existence, but it still scares me. Anyone else have any fears similar to this?"
Anxiety,a helpful tip to help during panic attacks by my therapist,"my therapist recently taught me a really helpful trick to help during panic attacks and last night i had one and it actually helped me. She said to write yourself a really small note telling yourself that you’re not dying and to breathe and relax and that’s it will pass  (because that’s what makes me panic a lot of the times since panic attack and heart attack symptoms are so similar). A lot of the times it’s hard for me to think logically when i’m anxious or having a panic attack and i just assume that i’m going to die so reading a note to yourself from when you were capable of thinking logically helps a lot! You can write anything in the note that you know might help you feel better, breathe, and calm down. I wrote a small one that I carry in my wallet so i always have it with me. Hope this helps :)"
Anxiety,Here is a little advice on something that I find helpful and I’m hoping to help others too!,"I wanted to leave a tip about something for those who struggle with anxiety like I do that I find helpful and you might as well! 

When I first met my boyfriend he came up with this great idea to make a music playlist. We each sent a song a day until the end of the month and made a play list out of it! 

He goes to school 1.5 hours away from me and when he’s not at school he lives 2.5 hours away from me. I find that listening to the playlist when I’m feeling anxious about anything, when I miss him, or when we leave each other after a weekend together extremely helpful! 🥰"
Anxiety,"Part of me, to defeat social anxiety, wants to just shout hello to passers by. But then I feel like not doing it because I don't know if that person will feel awkward themselves.","I don't mean shout as in shout shout, I just mean loudly say."
Anxiety,"Anyone else start off when going outside feeling uncomfortable and gradually becoming more comfortable the longer outside. Then when going back outside even just straight after you came home, you're all nervous again?",
Anxiety,Tips to have closure in my mind for an issue that's already solved?,"I know it will get better over time, I'm only unsure about the short-term strategy of managing it. I worry that shifting my attention from the subject will hinder me in properly processing it and dealing with it.

In my case, it's about a guy who I kinda like but he loves me which caused me some pretty rough anxiety in the past week because I don't feel that much romantically towards him and didn't know how to proceed. I finally offered him to stay just friends but he said he feels too strongly about me and can't do it, so we parted ways peacefully (which I still feel kinda guilty about).

Like I said, I know I will be better soon, but I don't think it's beneficial for my mental health to just try to occupy my thoughts with other things/people. Or is it? Does it help me to heal faster if I just try to forget about him as soon as possible? We were also in a squad playing together, so now that the wounds are still fresh, it's awkward for me to talk to those who know both of us. (And I also started to worry a bit that I'm gonna react with extreme anxiety every time a guy gets close enough to me that he could be my potential boyfriend, but that's another topic. 🤦🏻)"
Anxiety,I keep having embarrassing public outbursts and feel like I need to move," I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for most of my life, and I'm pretty sure I have at least mild BPD because I just cannot seem to control my emotions when I get upset. I am 34 and this has been going on most of my life; I have sought treatment more times than I can remember and am on three different meds to manage my anxiety and depression.  


But I still get into these situations where I'm incredibly stressed and frustrated, and I end up completely losing it in public - usually on the street/sidewalk, but sometimes I have ""freakouts"" in stores, restaurants, etc. Most of the time I just scream at the top of my lungs and hit myself in the face repeatedly while saying crazy things - basically just an adult temper tantrum. I suppose it must feel cathartic in the moment, but it's extremely embarrassing afterward. I have a running list now of places (stores, restaurants, etc) I can no longer go because I had an adult temper tantrum in public and am too ashamed to go back.  


Even worse, this keeps happening at home in my apartment complex - just this morning, I slept through my alarm and was running super late to work, so I screamed and hit myself in the face right outside my building at around 7 in the morning. Just the other day, my smoke detector wouldn't stop beeping, and I didn't know how to turn it off, so I started screaming at the top of my lungs ""STOP!! STOP!! STOP!!"" (also very early in the morning) - eventually I just had to take out the batteries and snip the wires - now I'm too embarrassed to even put in a work order to fix/replace it. And I'm sure all my neighbors know who I am by now - ""that crazy guy with the dog who's always yelling."" I am EXTREMELY embarrassed to show my face around my apartment and have to look down at all times to avoid eye contact or interaction with anyone, since they might recognize me as the crazy guy and get into a confrontation.  


Has anyone else here dealt with a similar issue? Have you found any outlets for frustration or any way to relieve stress?"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety rashes?,
Anxiety,Anxiety recovery i think,So i been calm from anxiety for 3 days or so. I don't know if I'm in recovery from anxiety but my mom said i might be but it's scary because i heard people who has anxiety that will have a bad panic attack after they feel calm in certain amount of days. But i still feel a tiny bit of anxiety there and here but other then that I'm just calm. I don't know why but I'm waiting for a panic attack to happen because I'm use to having anxiety everday.
Anxiety,How to get over Gym Anxiety?,"How do you get over anxiety of going to the gym? I can’t get over the crippling fear that I’m going to be judged. 

Thanks!"
Anxiety,Does moving to another location help with anxiety?,"So for a while now I've been thinking about moving, maybe going back to school in another state. I'm thinking if I do that I might get a fresh start and all my worries will kinda fade away. I know for some people moving makes anxiety worse, anyway I just wanted to know if anyone here has moved further away and how it impacted your anxiety."
Anxiety,Is this OCD?,I’m 17 and ive always been attracted to women. But I think I’ve been having POCD and it’s destroying my life. It keeps convincing me I’m attracted to 11 year old girls. It’s making me so anxious I woke up and instantly had these thoughts and had a knot in my stomach. Sometimes this OCD feels so real. And it’s getting me to the point where I literally can’t stop crying. I balled my eyes out 2 nights ago. I almost did again yesterday and today after I woke up I decided to pray to God and listen to some worship music and without even doing anything my eyes instantly just started watering and eventually I started crying. It’s wrecking my emotions. I don’t feel like myself anymore and it makes me so sad. Idk who this is. Is this OCD?
Anxiety,Dreading another night of no sleep,"I have GAD and a huge anxiety trigger for me is sleep. Last night I slept for 2 hours and then woke up off and on for the rest of the night. I think I'm adjusting to my new dosage of Zoloft but I'm having such a fucking hard time. I should be exhausted from my shitty night, but I feel like I drank too much caffeine and am losing my shit. I can't muster myself up to take my dog out or exercise, though I know it would be helpful and would probably burn off some of my energy. I know I'll probably have another bad night of sleep and anxiety attacks tonight and it's really traumatic for both me and my partner when this happens. I'm just so frustrated because since starting medication 6.5 weeks ago it's been a rollercoaster, but last week I thought I'd finally found the right dose and felt great. It was so amazing to just feel calm, with little to no anxiety, great decision-making skills, and feel like my ""old self"" before my disorder started. I've felt my anxiety slowly ramping up over the past several days and today it's terrible. I can't focus on anything. It takes so much mental work to just get up, brush my hair, shower, and get dressed. Thankfully I'm off work until Tuesday, because idek how I'd work in this state. I'm all by myself and can't focus on books, movies, activities, chores, etc. I've just been more or less laying down for several hours, taking tiny steps to get the tiniest things done, like a shower and getting dressed. I just feel like my whole life is a shitshow and every time I get a little relief from my anxiety it disappears as soon as I feel like I'm starting to heal. I have all this free time and it would be great to be able to get things done, but all I can do is think about how fucking anxious I am. My partner and I were really looking forward to this weekend together, but now I'm pretty sure my anxiety will fuck it up and I'll ruin everything. Sigh."
Anxiety,Inspirational Poem (05/07/21),"# The Wind, One Brilliant Day

*by Antonio Machado*

The wind, one brilliant day, called to my soul with an odor of jasmine.

""In return for the odor of my jasmine, I’d like all the odor of your roses.""

""I have no roses; all the flowers in my garden are dead.""

""Well then, I’ll take the withered petals and the yellow leaves and the waters of the fountain.""

The wind left. And I wept. And I said to myself: ""What have you done with the garden that was entrusted to you?""

Anxiety,"Oooft, here to say that middle of the night panic attacks and intrusive thoughts are no joke.",Hope everyone is okay out there.

Anxiety,scalp scratching,"hi everyone &lt;3 I have diagnosed GAD and with it I’ve developed a habit of scratching my scalp ALL. THE. TIME. because my GAD is pretty severe, there’s never really a time where I’m completely relaxed, so I find myself scratching my scalp almost all hours of the day. for some kind of reason it helps me, but at the same time I really want to stop doing it because I scratch so much to the point where I get little scratches all over my scalp - and they hurt, obviously. does anyone do the same thing and knows a method that works to stop it? any advice is welcome!! thank you"
Anxiety,Anxiety Sucks,"I've had anxiety as long as I can remember. In some ways it gotten better in other ways it's gotten worse. I am so tired of it though. Having anxiety when I start a new job, go in for an interview, take a new class, have to present, meeting new people, go to the doctors. I recently took a certified nursing assistant class and even though I did fantastic in the class I got so anxious  about having to demonstrate my skills I did horrible. Even though I ended up passing I was going so slow and felt confused. When she went off to calculate our score I wanted to cry so bad. It just feels so silly to get that worked up. I know though the only way to overcome it is to go out and do the things that make you uncomfortable. I'm gonna keep working on it but gosh it sucks"
Anxiety,Everything is pissing me off,"Hey guys, 

Anyone has this problem? Like, some days everything pisses me off. My parents, my sister, my dog. Some noises (loud ones, chewing, breathing heavy, high pitch barking, the noise people make when drinking water omfg…). And sometimes even people being near me or talking to me. I just want to be left alone as long as I want. Problem is when I’m like this I tend to lash out to people.

I know this is on me 'cause I can’t just expect everybody to disappear every once in a while and lashing out for literally being alive doesn’t make sense. 
But does this happens to you? Do you get kinda overwhelmed around people? How do you manage these days?"
Anxiety,Highway driving or other “situational” anxiety,Has anyone else ever dealt with extreme anxiety when driving on the highway? I used to drive up to 60km a year on highways and then one day I had a panic attack driving. Since then I’ve been struggling for nearly 3 years with driving on the highway to the point where I’ll avoid it at all costs. Has anyone else been through this or other acute anxiety in specific situations? What helped?
Anxiety,My doctor has prescribed me Ativan has anyone had a good experience with this medication for severe anxiety,I have been prescribed it for one month twice daily
Anxiety,Hydroxyzine,Yes guys I gave it another shot because my doctor wanted me to. I took it at about 7 pm I felt “ok” no anxiety but a depressing feeling I had for sure. Then the night come the doctor has me 2mg Ativan at night also. So I’m just chilling watching YouTube and I black out straight up black out woke up in my chair instead of my bed. Which Is so weird I’ve taken much more Ativan than that before and still been able to keep my eyes open and function. But it seemed like my body had enough after that hydroxyzine it was crazy. Next day all the depressed symptoms are gone and I do feel a little refreshed but I’m not sure it’s worth it I didn’t enjoy last night much at all
Anxiety,Anyone late 30s and an anxiety sufferer?,"I’m a 38 year old mum of 3. I’ve been anxious my whole life and this led to depression in my teens which means I’ve been on and off medication since then. I can’t remember a time I haven’t felt this way, but I accept that unfortunately this is who I am.

What I am struggling with as I get older is how much I’ve missed out on, the things I’ve failed at because being so anxious made me give up or not even try, and it feels like as I age this list becomes more apparent. Eg I dropped out of college (uk) because my parents kept telling me it was a waste of time and they needed rent off me, so then it was just a stream of useless dead end jobs. I’ve got no career and I know at this age my chances are few. 

I attempted getting my cbt a couple of years ago, I can still recall the sweating and panic and racing heart etc I had to give up and leave. My friend has just aced hers today and loved it. It’s just a reminder of yet another thing I’ve failed at and I feel ridiculous for thinking this way. 

I can drive but I don’t because I worry about any potential problems, parking etc. I’ve got no friends - I’m not exaggerating - I just have my husband. I’m alone all the time, I walk a lot.

I don’t know what I expect from posting, I just feel so lonely and useless. My parents neglected me terribly as a child and I hate that I’m like this as a result, too scared to do anything. I’m not suicidal, I just wish I had never existed. My life has been so hard so far and the thought of living for the next x amount of years is the worst.

I wondered if anyone felt similar, or if you’re older how have things worked out for you?"
Anxiety,Why can’t everyday be as good as the last?,"I know healing isn’t linear but I still held onto hope it could be. Yesterday I had one of the best days I had ever had in a very long time; woke up early, smiled and just felt so happy to be alive for the first time in a long time. 

Today I woke up late, haven’t eaten breakfast yet and I just feel like anxious and like trash :( i wanna cry and curl up into a ball

I hate how things change so quickly and i just hope the day gets a little better :("
Anxiety,Help in pain,"Hey so my left side of my body has been having some pain, Iv had pain on my left shoulder blade, pain in my tendons that connect my left shoulder to my I guess chest muscles, it’s like a dull pain feeling. It hasn’t gotten worse or anything so I don’t think it’s that serious but it makes me stressed feeling it and my throat has also been tensing up lately or it will feel like I can’t breath or swallow, Iv all around had some strange feels this month, idk if it’s my allergies or what but it freaks me out and I just want it to stop."
Anxiety,How to deal with dizziness and light headed causing extreme anxiety?,I don’t know which is triggering the other but I am so anxious. Does anyone have any advice how to deal with this?
Anxiety,Anxiety about my own existence,For a few months now I’ve been overthinking about my own existence and how meaningless life is in the grand scheme of things (sorta like feeling like i’m just in a simulation kinda thing. i’m trying to keep a level head about this and i’m seeing a psychiatrist as soon as i can but i just can’t seem to figure out what this stems from. i’m having a hard time getting enjoyment out of the things i normally love doing. i still like listening to music and that kinda calms me and makes me feel real and grounded in reality for a second but i keep getting anxious and scared about things that in reality don’t matter at all. like watching a movie can make me anxious for no reason and i start thinking about how the show’s not real and it doesn’t matter and all that. i simply keep having intrusive negative ass thoughts about normal things when i’m normally a pretty chill person. i’ve considered it stems from just being super stressed and having a full time job at 21 and having to move back into my parents house because of the pandemic but this just feels more extreme. anyone had a similar experience or have any advice for the time being?
Anxiety,"I started therapy today, it went amazingly!!","I started therapy earlier today and it was no where near as scary as i thought it was going to be! He was so nice and calm, comforted me when i needed it and genuinely listened to me. I'm so glad that my life is improving, i'm really knew to reddit, i only joined yesterday because i wanted to work on socialising more, and for me thats easiest to do on the internet, but i know if i continue therapy then eventually ill be brave enough to make irl friends too! if your considering therapy to help with anxiety, then i 100 % recommend it!!"
Anxiety,COVID anxiety spiralling...,"My anxiety about getting the virus is really really bad and effects my daily life (takes me hours sometimes to muster the strength to leave the house for groceries etc). 

My partner and I both were fortunate enough to get one dose of vaccine but where I live the virus is extremely out of control and we are not fully protected so I’m still scared. My partner has to go to work and his main coworker hasn’t been vaccinated yet. He could go, but he is taking his sweet time booking the appointment. I know I cannot control anyone else’s actions or what they do with their body, but I have so much anxiety knowing my partner has to work super close with this person who isn’t vaccinated. My partner is extremely cautious and he says his coworker is too but I can’t be sure cuz I’m not around them right. 

Today we got in a big argument cuz I said I was concerned that his coworker doesn’t care as much about covid safety as we do and it’s making me feel anxious. My partner felt like I was attacking his friend and insists they both care and are doing everything they can to be safe. If that was true then his coworker would have booked a vaccine appointment already. I just cannot seem to get out of this negative spiral of worrying. SOS"
Anxiety,Chest pain with heart attack symptoms,"I spoke to a cardiologist virtually two months ago due to the pandemic he ordered an echo stress test and 7 day Holter monitor all of this was normal prior to this I visited the ER department like 12 times in 3 months because I experienced dizziness , nausea , chest pain , feel like I will pass and pain radiating in left shoulder they did blood work, x-ray and ECG all normal . I experienced it again went at midnight to ER two weeks it was all normal again..I am experiencing those same symptos again today and have had it checked out as recent as two weeks ago not sure I should go. It's get aggrevated when lifting heavy stuff and I suffer from health anxiety and also panic , really don't think I need to go again but the chest pain and other Symptoms are scary. I had an abdominal CT during a visit to the ER for another health anxiety abdominal pain it revealed a small gastric hiatal hernia but my doctor said it's not of concern I also suffer from gerd . The pain is so scary and also feel like I will faint and pass out . Going to the ER costs me so much everytime and takes so much of my time. The cardiologist said those were normal and so did the ER doctor two weeks ago"
Anxiety,Feeling Low: Chest Pain,"Really feeling down and of course anxious. Was having a wonderful time with my niece and her friend. We were at the mall and all of a sudden, I started having really sharp chest pains. One after another. So my anxiety of course kicks in and I’m thinking about telling them I need an ambulance. We finally get out of the mall and the pain is gone. I think alright, let’s grab lunch and head home. Of course half way through the lunch the pain comes back even worse. Like stabbing and pressure in my chest. Of course I rush them through lunch, and this is one of the last times I’m going to see my niece for a while because we live in another state. Rush home and drop her off. So defeated. But at the same time I’m just worried I’m having a heart attack. I hate this so much. I’ve been to two cardiologists wore a halter monitor, stress tests, multiple ekg’s—and the only thing one cardiologist told me was I have an extra beat less than one percent of all beats which is not uncommon. So I ruined my time with my niece. I’m sitting here debating going to a hospital for them to once again say I’m fine. I’m now worried that at a family dinner tonight I’ll either drop dead or spiral into a panic attack. I feel helpless. 

Has anyone ever just consistently had stabbing pains or palpitations and they just never turn out to be anything serious? How do you manage these events after countless docs say you’re fine. I don’t want to give up but this feels hopeless. Any and all advice is appreciated."
Anxiety,OCD is absolutely draining,"I mean... I’m not sure about you guys. But my anxiety is there pretty much 24/7. I mean seriously, my lifespan is gonna get cut by half by this stupid monster called OCD. I fucking hate it...."
Anxiety,Mom with panic disorder,"So my mom takes meds for her panic disorder. My sister also has anxiety/depression. Something they have in common. Me and my dad do not. Every time my mom and me get into an argument it’s because she’s comparing me to hers and my sisters relationship or other people. For example, she just had hip surgery on April 1st I wrote to her to let me know if there is anything I can do and that was that. Since then has been Easter and today’s my husband’s birthday (5 days not even a week) She texted me saying I was insensitive never checked in on her doesn’t look like I care...I also have 3 kids all under 3 (if you have kids you know). How do I keep a healthy relationship with her (and if I should) I’m at my whits end. This has gone on my whole life her comparing me to my sister (like I lack emotion and understanding of others) she also dwells on things and tries to get pity parties but never changes anything. Ex: complains about weight but still eats chocolate and not work out or even go on a walk, complains about my dad but doesn’t get a divorce (she’s had an affair) I’ve literally lost respect for her and with children of my own there is a balance of being around toxic attitudes. I’m trying to find that balance of not bring insensitive but looking out for my children’s well being and my own mental health. Like they just suck me down with them. Again I’m not insensitive but what’s the balance of not being dragged down with them? Hearing the same thing on repeat but them taking no action."
Anxiety,Future worries,"I am currently stuck in a degree that I don't particularly like or hate, i like some subjects but others i don't. It's civil engineering and the major reason why i am doubting not quitting is because i will be useful to the world later on and i will be more assured of a good future for myself. However, I keep thinking about what if's, and now i also applied for linguistics as it's something i incredibly enjoy doing and thinking about and I already told my parents and the few friends I have that i will switch majors, but now I just heard that my father is not completely supportive of my choice and he never told me. Yesterday i snapped to my mother and I want to apologize but that apology will require me to open up about my worries and (possible) other mental disorders i have and i am really not ready for that. I keep thinking that maybe linguistics might not be the right choice as i really cannot see how it would benefit the world in a significant way and I hate that i am so selfish that i might want to pursue it and that i love it so much that i'd throw away something like Civil Engineering (where I did get good grades) for it.... I really don't know what to do, at first i thought civeng would be the perfect degree but it turned out not to be but what if that ""mistake"" is with myself and i will experience the same thing with linguistics and all other degrees that i might switch to in the future. I feel like my constant worries are holding me back from a normal future that might actually be important to the world. At the same time i hate myself for thinking i am so ""good"" that i can actually make a difference. 

There have been a lot more things but this is what I am mainly troubled by lately.."
Anxiety,I can't fall asleep.,I'm still stressed about the ps vita coming before the store shuts down. I posted about it previously and I should be asleep by now. It's midnight and my stomach hurts with stress. I tried things that help but they don't work. And I have another problem on my hand that started today that is making it worse. Please. I need help.
Anxiety,Anyone else wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety/panic?,"I know we’re told that waking up with anxiety or negative dreams are our subconscious, anxious mind. But, I’m constantly anxious, and I wake up maybe one night, every few weeks in a panic. I have been woken up by panic twice tonight already and it’s only 3 am. It’s always so scary when it happens, and then I convince myself it’s a brain tumor or some health ailment causing it. I  then continue to panic as I fall asleep because that feeling of lightly falling asleep, when your thoughts start to seem dream-like, send me into a spiral. Ugh. There have been times I’ve woke up gasping, almost mid panic attack and jump out of bed. Its so annoying- can’t even escape this shit in my sleep. Just wanting to see if anybody else dealt with this awful shit?!"
Anxiety,Does anyone else do this?,"If I'm walking somewhere and there are one or two people behind me, I slow down, pretend to do something on my phone, and wait until they pass me. I just hate when someone is behind me. Does anyone else do this?"
Anxiety,Overwhelming Hyper-awareness,"I’m too fucking AWARE of everything and it’s awful. I cannot for the life of me focus because there’s so much going on at every second in the world. I want to scream all the time because of the goddamn complexity of it all, how do people live functioning lives?? Every task seems overwhelming and things always feel surreal"
Anxiety,Time is moving too quickly,"This month has been really difficult for me. My work's been piling on and I'm finding it hard to control my anxieties. On top of that I'm also worried about my family's health. My parents aren't even that old, but I think a lot about their mortality and how life is going by so quickly. I'm scared of reaching my 30s, and adjusting my identity from ""young person"" to someone who is not so young. I don't know if I can handle the responsibility of maintaining a functional adult life.

I'm constantly worried about what my classmates and boss think of me, and whether I'm underperforming or not meant to be in my career path. I want to ask for extensions on some of my work, but I'm afraid doing so will be admitting defeat. Which is ridiculous because we've been in a global pandemic for over a year and there IS leniency given should you ask for it. I know I shouldn't hold myself up to impossible standards, but it's hard not to compare myself to my talented colleagues, who seem infinitely more hardworking and smart. What I'm most afraid of is working in a field I hate and not even being paid well for it. I want to take care of my parents some day, and I want to be fulfilled in my work. I've been spiraling lately and these two things seem so out of my reach. I wish I could go back to high school times where my biggest worry was whether my friends and I shared the same lunch period."
Anxiety,Really bad stomach ache woke me up,"Yesterday was the first day of taking 2 fluoxetine pills at once and before sleeping I had really bad pain in the groin, mostly in my right testiacle which still feels achy right now. I also have a bad stomach ache and it woke me up in the middle of the night , but I just took a tyanol. These make me feel really, really bad. Pretty sure stomach aches are normal side effects but not sure abo it the groin region."
Anxiety,absorbing other people’s anxiety,"Hi. When I am alone I feel pretty relaxed and grounded. but today I noticed when I was surrounded by other people that talked fast / anxiously / unnecessarily I felt like I had to act that way too. Or I was afraid that I would make them uncomfortable or they would judge me if I didn’t match their vibe.

Why do I feel so responsible for other people’s emotions and why can’t I just be myself.

I also have another problem where I don’t know how to be friendly / send out good vibes without being a people pleaser. And if I just do my own thing without giving a fuck I feel like I come off as a total asshole and there’s no middle ground.

I feel like I’m constantly acting unless I can feel the other person has ‘the vibe’ and then I can just be me without any worry.

should probably be seeing a therapist but I PROCRASTINATE.

thank you for your help"
Anxiety,"Sometimes getting better is a mixture of the right people surrounding you, luck, and being able to grab an opportunity","Hello everyone ! I don’t know if this is the right place / the right flair, but I just wanted to share my victory story so that you guys know that it does get better !

A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, along with severe insomnia, depression and PTSD (which only exacerbated my anxiety). For most of my life, I was more in a perpetual state of more or less severe anxiety, and didn’t even know it. 

I went to see a wonderful therapist, who worked with me to get better and, since then it’s been slowly getting better - it was strange feeling “normal”, I got anxious about my lack of anxiety because I was so used to it that I felt like something was missing and that it was “too good to be true”. 

One thing I was terribly anxious about was my future - I was having trouble in university, didn’t really know what I wanted to do, and was completely lost. 

Then, through a stroke of luck, being at the right place at the right time and talking to the right person, I was taken on for an internship in a law firm. I was lucky to be surrounding by caring people who taught me so much and valued me, but most of all made sure I knew I was valued, and I finally felt useful, I finally was able to take initiatives. Things as simple as answering the phone at work, contacting clients, being confident in the work I was doing, I’d never felt like that before. 

Then, the internship sadly ended. My exams went badly. Anxiety got the better of me. I needed to find a job. Oh, the return of the nausea, sharp stomach pains, my heart felt as if someone was playing bobbing apples with it. 

And, through a stroke of luck / coincidence, I applied for a job I didn’t really think I’d get, but I’d applied because I had used the software of this company. And I got a callback: it turned out it was to work with the software I had used. Two interviews. And I was hired. I couldn’t believe it. For a couple of weeks I was anxious that I had perhaps imagined it, even though it sounds ridiculous. 

It’s been nearly three months and I can hardly feel my anxiety cropping up anymore. I am incredibly lucky to again be working with people who are caring, who take the time to teach me, who don’t berate me for mistakes and who make sure I know I am valued, and it honestly makes all the difference in the world. 

My career path is not the one I thought I would have but I am the happiest and the least anxious I have been in my whole life. Starting to get better made me able to grab opportunities, and even if I’ve been throwing myself into unknown situations, the little shot of anxiety isn’t even comparable to the crippling bog of anxiety I felt I couldn’t come out of. 

A couple of years ago I couldn’t even answer a phone at work, and today I finished a whole project where I had to interview clients and present my findings to a team of my bosses. If someone had told me this two years ago I would never have believed them. 

There are things I need to work on (26 and have intense anxiety driving / calling up my driving school to start classes again, I still don’t have my licence for example ...) but I hope this gives you guys a bit of hope ! Stay safe xx"

Anxiety,Any help would be appreciated,"My anxiety has gotten very bad lately. I’ve had to deal with this since the 10th grade and it’s been haunting me for years now. I can’t talk properly to other people besides maybe my friends and always have a heavy chest even when I don’t have anything to stress about. My chest suddenly squeezes and tenses whenever someone brings my name up or even when I talk to my distant family members online I just feel like not doing it. It’s gotten so bad to the point where I get nervous talking to my own family. This is where I need some help. I’ve gotten so used to like hiding my stuff such as my phone dms and whatever I’m watching on YouTube I’ll always wear headphones in hopes that no one will hear it since it might have swearing or something not “appropriate”. I’ve hidden my phone dms and don’t even call my friends because Idk how my family would react. I love my family but sometimes I get really anxious around them. When I go outside with my friends and come back home, I always get tensed and anxious thinking that my parents will think I’m doing drugs or something when I’m clearly not, but them making me anxious will trick me into thinking I did which makes me even more nervous. I can’t take my phone to the living room because I’m afraid my parents will be like let me see what u and ur friends talk about (no harm intended by them of course, they’re just checking up to see what I’m up to and my friends interests) but since my friends and I talk about things they won’t particularly enjoy, I just don’t bring my phone altogether. When I go to sleep I’m paranoid my family including my sibling will check my phone and that makes me more nervous. Idk what it is about me that I just get nervous even though I know my family don’t want to do any harm to me. I can’t even workout in my room cause I don’t wanna be heard with my heavy breathing. Any tips on what to do would greatly be appreciated."
Anxiety,Scared to go outside with my wife and son,"Hey everyone.  So thanks to this horrible virus situation my family and I have already loved pretty isolated for the past year, only going out for absolute necessities.  But that’s not what I’m scared of the most, as the people around here are good at following the rules and my family and I adhere to them as well.  What I’m scared of is all of the hate crimes and violence going on right now.  My wife is Korean, and my son is half Korean, and I genuinely am terrified of going to basic places like Walmart or the grocery store in fear of potential assault or murder.  Obviously I’m aware these things have always been an issue and people could die at any moment, the fact that all this anti-Asian hate has recently pretty much put a huge target on my wife and her community’s back scares the shit out of me.  

Any tips or words of reassurance to get me through my errands tomorrow would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you guys for your support."
Anxiety,Anyone else constantly worry of parent(s) and future?,"My brain really enjoys creating the most torturous thoughts to attack me and make me feel terrible. It is a master strategist at creating thoughts to destroy me. It bothers me with thoughts of my aging father getting a mental illness like Alzheimer’s or worse and me having to watch him decay with no memory or remnant of his past self, just a soul trapped in a mindless vehicle. It also would bother me about my past doing drugs and hanging around people who kill like it’s normal. I still get scared I’ll get shot walking or driving around, I’ll even feel like someone is stalking me while I’m home, I don’t feel safe sometimes anymore. Marijuana and spirituality help only to a certain extent because my anxiety is extremely powerful. Anxiety also hits me in small ways with small details to anything in terms of life, it even makes me think the afterlife is going to be depressing and full of struggle still. Am I the only one suffering like this it comforts me to know I am not alone and there are people in worse positions who would envy having a home to go in and the ability to choose what they eat when some peoples home out there is a hole in the street. It seems anxiety will always find something even when I’ve conquered all thoughts my heart will clench in pain as if I’m in danger or any of the situations in my head have happened."
Anxiety,Feel so anxious atm,"Some people are threatening me and our ministry that we should not continue preaching God's word in our community and helping the needy.These at the same people that kidnapped our director and tortured him badly🥺😰😰.am really so depressed about life,I tried reaching out to local police but they couldn't do anything about providing security for us and later I realised that this police was bribed by these antichrists 😒😔oh lord have mercy 🙏🙏☹️😂"
Anxiety,Hello!,"I am so happy I found this group, to have a group of people that can relate to what I am going through and possibly offer suggestions!   

Lately, I have been having more of an issue controlling my anxiety.  My husband asks what is triggering it, and seems annoyed when I tell him I cannot pin point it.  It drives my husband crazy when I am all over the house finding something to do in attempts to distract myself.   I absolutely dread going to the store lately, bc any size crowd is getting me more anxious.  

I have been taking my PRN medication more.  What does everyone else do when they find themselves feeling more overwhelmed with their anxiety, especially while they are out in public"
Anxiety,Night Sweats,"I've been regularly getting night sweats, it's pretty disgusting waking up to everything being soaked.
Plus I can't be cleaning sheets and quilts everytime... 
Sometimes I'll sleep through the whole night and wake up, others bad dream might wake me up in the middle of the night (can confirm turning quilt over, pillows over and trying cover the mattress with something dry so I can go sleep is not a fun process when it's cold).

I haven't been to a doctors, with lockdown and all here. Obviously my mental health is bad, anxiety is all over the place and I'm depressed. 

Has anyone had these troubles and found ways of reducing these sweats? (I sleep naked 95% of the time if that makes any difference). Or seen a GP about the issue

Anxiety,Alcohol,"Used to be a heavy drinker for years and years, was drinking with family on Easter and it doesn’t feel the same since I developed anxiety a couple years ago. It makes me feel disgusting and even anxious while “drunk” I don’t think there is any reason for people with anxiety to be drinking it’s much different then a Benzo the sleep is horrible is raises blood pressure the next day and induced negative thoughts. Anyone have similar reactions with alcohol ? I think it’s safe to just steer clear if you’re really that anxious take a Benzo instead. Thank me later"

Anxiety,how to explain to parents that I literally don’t want to talk?,"I’m not sure how to start this but oh well.
My parents are the type to be insistent that we talk about stuff, which I know is the normal thing to do, but not only does talking (the action itself) make me extremely anxious, I also can’t articulate anything properly. Most of the time it’s not even clear in my brain what I want to say (it’s just really foggy and I feel stupid because of it), so I hate talking. As a result, I tend to write stuff down and communicate over text instead or send articles about things I need to explain. My friends respect this, but unfortunately my parents don’t.
It’s really frustrating because I can’t and I honestly don’t want to verbally explain what I’m dealing with when there’s a perfectly good paper or article written about my exact problem and feelings, it’s even worse that my relationship with my parents is awkward and was absolutely horrible when I was 11-16 (I’m 18 now and it’s gotten better but I can’t handle any sort of emotional talks or shows of affection).
At best they’ll ignore what I send them over text, at worst they’ll basically corner me and force me to talk. I don’t, and it just ends with them being mad at me.
Its happened with my ADD, its happened with me coming out as trans, and a bunch of other things. My dad is the worst because he gets mad or sort of threatens that we HAVE to talk when I message him and it sends me into a spiral until I see him because I just can’t.
What can I do to make them understand this? Whenever I try to explain it (yes, face to face for once) they literally just say “but can’t you just say it?”.
Side note, while my issue with talking is most likely related to anxiety, it’s not something I want to do either. I’ve never liked talking even before I had anxiety. So I’m not looking for a ‘fix’ or a way to start talking to my parents, I’m looking for a way to set a boundary and make them understand that I’ll tell them what’s going on in my brain but not in person."
Anxiety,Trying to get over my anxiety,"So I want to share this story to be inspirational but also to be real. I’m not a native English speaker, so please forgive any mistakes. 

“Getting over” anxiety, meaning getting my symptoms to an acceptable degree and a more positive psychology going on, was a fight I had been fighting without realizing what it was. 

I want to share a short story of my last few years:

For years I didn’t have friends and closed myself off. Part anxiety, part bullying, part depression. 

Over time I tried to seek help and reach out more. In the hopes of slowly building friends and to stop avoiding social contact. 
During this time I’ve had countless of rejections “we don’t want to hang out with you”, cutouts (everyone invited but me) and stuff like that.

Against all this pain and dreading I later tried making friends at a new university at a new town. Things seemed to be okay; they didn’t mind me being there, got me rounds of beer and invited me to come over with the rest of the group. 
I got to a point where I thought I was finally building friendships! I saved up courage and prepared my birthday party; one I’ve only given during childhood and was too scared to do out of fear nobody would show up. 

I invited the group in time; gave a subtle reminder on the day of (“looking forward!”)
And, unfortunately, Once again, had a birthday by myself. 

I continued reviewing (my) psychology and behavior and trying to find new perspectives as of why I have so much trouble. 

Instead of crawling back into my cave I did the opposite: I poured my money into a ticket to the other side of the world (+ a budget). 
It was legit the scariest thing I could imagine, but my way of facing fears. It almost seems like self punishment looking back on it. 

I Hated every second counting towards my flight. Was full of fear in the beginning. I hated every thought coming up in my head and probably looked like the most lost tourist you could find. Even on the airport I simply looked as if I was a cocaine smuggler and 5 packets just cracked in my stomach... Sweaty, twitchy and nervous!

But, to my surprise, once I arrived and got settled the people I met were nice to me. Often we didn’t share a language and still they asked me to join to social events.
I learnt to be more social and met up with more and more people. 
Eventually I made it into somewhat of a sport for myself and enjoyed a large circle of friendly people traveling with me throughout Asia for a few months! Yes there were ups and downs, but since i could choose to never see these people again I could stop being so scared of what I’m doing or what’s happening. 

I lived like the king of my own world and could only see my future changing. My past would’ve been learnt from and now I had won! 

I got home again, full of joyous spirits and confidence. Ready to start a new life (again).
....

..Those spirits died within a week. 
I was back to my cave. Back to no social circle. Back to anxiety. 
My whole adventure now slowly sizzling out in the background of my memory. Slowly fading and twisted into: “that was just an escape” “that wasn’t really you” “real life is not like this”. 

Again I lived scared and alone. For months

When I later found a new job, preparing myself for a new studies, I met new people again. I was anxious, scared. But once again to my surprise they were friendly! 
They seemed too busy with themselves to care about me. Then one day of my second week a coworker asks what I’ve been up to before this; “traveled Asia” I answered. 
Wow yes! You too?! Have you experienced this? And how did you go about this?

BAM: the adventure caught the spark again! It WAS real! That me does live in there! 

I channel all that energy back into real life and feel my confidence growing. 
I don’t have a happy place. I have a happy version of me. 

Fast forward a few years and I’m now halfway a degree, with about three people I can call genuine friends. Also, I met the love of my life during a new adventure I went on! 

Am I never anxious? I wish.
Am I still scared shitless when thinking about a new adventure? Yes.
Have I dared to celebrate my birthday? No. 

But I’ll get there. We’ll get there. 

For me it’s been all about not taking my feelings and thoughts as the font in which the story of my life should be written. Fight your label. Build a life you’re comfortable with. Even when it’s reeeaaallly shitty to do. 

Hope it helped anyone. Sorry if It was more of a vent than anything haha.."

Anxiety,Horrible parents and I cant heal,"
My parents have never been sympathetic at all with my mental health not even when i was at my youngest. When i was 12 my parents screamed at me and grounded me for cutting myself. When ever im crying or show any bit of emotion they will antagonise me saying whats that noise or try to upset me more in a way. Ive told them that i want to kill myself yet it has not changed their behaviour anyway they act like they dont believe me. I feel like i have wasted my teen years being depressed for 6 years and its horrible that my parents havent helped me but i still love them and some how put this past me sometimes yet every morning i wake up crying about this. But i just cant understand how they can act this way to me. When im older i feel like i am going to be more angry about this for maturity reasons but i dont want to live miserably anymore and i cant seem to move past this. Ive told them how i feel about it and they have nothing to say. I have tried the 2 counselling charites but none of them have got back to me and the nhs have told me there’s nothing more they can do. I honnestly dont know what i want to do and it hurts to much to talk to my friends about it and i dont want to put the burden on them. I really need some advice.
Thanks to anyone who helps"
Anxiety,Book recommendation for dealing with anxiety and self love,Any book recommendations would be helpful. Currently I am reading You can heal your life by Louise Hay.
Anxiety,"I've just started on medication and was told about the 2 week adjustment period as it settles in my system - it started okay, but now I feel totally out of control","I'm 6 days in on half doses, and tomorrow I start full doses - the first few days were great, I felt very calm and hopeful. But today I woke with a splitting headache and my heart is hammering. Panic is bubbling and it feels like I'm trying to hold the lid down on an overflowing pot. 

The frustration is that I KNOW its the medication exaggerating my anxiety as I get used to this, I was told to expect this by the doctor, I read the leaflet in the medication box, I did research on the specific type, but I still feel out of control. I know it gets better, but simultaneously my mind is telling me it won't.

I have deadlines and work to do, but I can't stomach it. I see my future ahead of me falling apart in a thousand different ways.

Please tell me it gets better - please tell me it will be okay"
Anxiety,I feel like everyone else can combat life and just get on with things and I just feel overwhelmed and completely up and down all the time.,"Does anyone else feel this way? I suffer from anxiety and depression to give background. 
I get overwhelmed so quickly and go into shutdown mode where I’m like “I can’t do this, I can’t do this, nope nope can’t do this”. And these moments do pass, eventually. But like I feel like I can’t relate to any of my friends. I have started uni this year (bachelor of nursing which I LOVE) but also find it pretty full on. To the point where I can’t fathom the thought of working as well (part-time)but still am working at this stage.

I also always feel up and down. One moment I feel great and I know what I want and the next moment I feel completely different (no I don’t suffer from bipolar). But I just feel like the people I know, just get on with things. They feel shit, or can’t be bothered, but they bloody still do it. Why is it some people are like this and I just, well, tap out (or strongly consider tapping out). I feel pathetic because of this. Guess I just wanna feel if anyone else feels the same?"
Anxiety,Lexapro not working because of antibiotics?,"About 2.5 years ago I started to have really bad anxiety that often manifested as a bad headache, muscle weakness, crying, and discomfort in my limbs. It was the worst and never went away. I started taking 10 mg of lexapro daily and very quickly noticed a vast improvement in my mood and symptoms. To the point that I felt I was cured. I have been on it now for 2.5 years with no major side effects or major anxiety event, until now. A few days ago I had to go to the urgent care because of a toe infection. The doctor started me Bactrim twice a day and Keflex four times a day. Within a day or two my anxiety started to run wild. I have headaches, tingling in my legs, panic, brain fog, insomnia, and others. My doctor told me to keep taking the antibiotics and prescribed me hydroxyzine. I don't feel much better and am having weird daydreams and can't focus. I am at my wits end. I am on the antibiotics for 3 more days but I worry that things won't return to the way they were before. Any reassurance or similar experience would be appreciated."
Anxiety,I wish I could stop caring about the smallest things,"I wish I could stop thinking about stuff and throw them out of the window like I no longer care.

For context, I’m feeling extra anxious about friends who I THINK are deliberately ignoring my messages. I know they’re not obligated to reply if they don’t want to, but it’s something I wouldn’t do to them, it just makes me feel like I did something wrong. I know this is anxiety speaking, I just want to stop thinking about stuff like these."
Anxiety,I fear I’ll die with cancer or some disease like that Bcos of my unhealthy living,"
I am a young male who is obese, with a BMI of 37, and also I have GERD ( frequent acid reflux and chest burn ) and hormone issues due to testicle issues. All this makes me fear that I’ll die with cancer , heart attack , I even started having eczema in skin and am allergic , I’m easily susceptible to cold. All this makes me feel afraid most of the times. 

Whenever I try to move on with life focus on my career or my passion and dream and hope about the future, this fear comes in and demoralises me , makes me want to just quit , cry , be scared , sit n my room and wait for death. 

I’m trying to fight it , since I came to know I have OCD thoughts , I’ve been fighting it a lot. Today again these thoughts are coming and it is demotivating me and I’m scared to lose the motivation I got in the last few days to work and stuff and go back to isolated waiting for death guy. 

So I guess I’m looking for support , advice or motivation that u guys can give , do U guys experience this , if so how do u deal with it ?"

Anxiety,I feel anxiety coming at me from all angles.,"I haven't had friends in a few years because the ones I used to have made no effort and stopped talking to me.  I have lots of social anxiety and I'm terrible with people.  I've never been in a relationship and I worry I'll be forever alone.  I'm spending most of my time working and commuting for a job I don't give a shit about.  I'm renting from family but struggling to find my own apartment because of the criminal prices people charge, even though I have a math degree and I'm making more money than ever.  I can't cope with roommates - it's hard enough to deal with people outside of my home.  I'm afraid I'll never be financially healthy unless I get married and have a second income, which makes being alone expensive on top of depressing.  Just venting."

Anxiety,I'm starting to feel like everything is crushing me,"Throw away account for reasons. 

I felt like for a while I was doing better, that I was okay maybe, but last few days have been crippling. It's as if all the sudden a switch was turned on in my head that is stronger than I've felt in years.

I'm trying my best but I'm definitely not winning any battles right now. I even pushed myself to get things done around the house but I'm back in the same spot I started in. I can't make phone calls anymore, answering the door is near impossible, and I dread getting up and going to work in the mornings simply because I'm terrified to make a mistake or talk to anyone. 

I push myself to get better, but I'm only getting worse. I say that the tag is, ""Needs a hug/support"" but I know once I post this I'll feel like an even bigger idiot than I was before and that there a low chance I'll even be able to reply to anyone. 

Talk about pathetic. I definitely feel pathetic.

I really don't know a proper place to post this, I'm not even sure if this is anxiety

The past few days I've been feeling.... bored, more often than usual, i often find myself from 3-6pm feeling empty, isolated, absolutely nothing to do except looking at my screen which i am tired of, i walk often but since i am young i have a lot of time, maybe too much, there's not much options since im stuck inside

There's nothing to do, this leaves me feeling quite empty, I can't really pin point this feeling very well, if there is a more suitable place to post, please inform me in the comments"
Anxiety,Bad separation anxiety,"(F21) Hi, Im crying for an hour now and cant calm myself. I think I have some kinda separation anxiety from people I love, now its mostly because of my boyfriend. We see each other usually every week but he lives with old sister and I live with my parents so we cant see more often because our families dont like the idea. We want to live together finally but also we cant find any job due to Covid. His sister told him I cant come to see him till he find a job, Im so shattered right now. Do you have any tips how to not think about it? I also suffer due to anxiety/anxiety attacks and taking antidepressants (actually new ones for 2 weeks so its harder now). Just everything started falling apart lately."
Anxiety,Is looking for meaning in things and focusing on coincidence a common OCD symptom?,"So I’ve had developments in my OCD patterns over the years and one of its main features now is this almost automatic process my brain goes through, where it’ll connect a thought I just had with an event that’s just occurred. I think find that I’ll obsess over it over and over and form connections between different things. Even down to thinking this person looks vaguely like this person, which my brain would then go into haywire over, as it starts looking for deep meaning for these things and why it’s happened.   Or another vague example would be if I’m searching for two things in particular online, then come across a site with both these things, my brain goes haywire and I have to do compulsions to ‘untangle’ these things and show they mean absolutely nothing.
Another one is as simple as thinking of some tv series or a certain thing, then suddenly seeing that it’s on or seeing there a tv programme on that subject. 
I do have other examples but thought I’d say some of the most simple ones that occur. 
I just want my brain to just see things as random noise and not form these connections between things. Thank you for reading. It’s appreciated."
Anxiety,Can anxiety make you feel your abdominal aorta alot?,i have pretty bad heart anxiety and i was just wondering if anyone can constantly feel your abdominal aorta pretty much 60% or so of the day. Thanks
Anxiety,I feel like anxiety is ruining all my relationships,"I don't mind when anxiety makes it difficult for me to talk to others, but I mean like the little voice in my head when I hear that my friends came somewhere without me because ""they definitely hate you and don't want to talk to you anymore because you're a boring person to be with""

I just sometimes let the spiral of anxious thoughts consume me and it makes me act like a dick. Like I just told my friend they were a bad friend because I felt like they didn't protect me when others were screaming at me because I definitely felt like"" oh they don't really care about you or the fact that others are rude to you""

Idk if that's a common anxiety thing or if I'm expressing it well. I'm really trying to control myself and stop myself before I act on impulse but I let it happen again because I felt threatened and now that person is going to leave me too because I'm an awful person.

I don't know how to stop it sometimes, it's ruining every relationship I ever had"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get really bad anxiety while driving ? Helpp,"I get bad anxiety while I drive, sometimes I worry that I side swiped a car or hit something. Idk why my anxiety does that to me, like I'll drive by a parked car in the street and instantly my anxiety sets in making me think ""did I side swipe that car "" even if I don't feel or hear any damage. I usually end up inspecting my whole car whenever I get to my destination or I will turn around after driving by and retrace my driving to make sure I didn't hit anything. I did that this morning actually. I drove by a parked truck on my way into work and I freaked out thinking I hit it, even though I didn't hear or feel any damage, drove back by the truck and it didn't look like it had any damage to it,  checked my car and it didn't have any damage either. I also worry about shit like getting charged with a hit and run and because of my anxiety and not wanting to be charged with that I retrace my driving alot. So if I did hit that truck this morning I hope I Dont get a hit and run charge..it was parked in front of a business so I'm sure they have cameras and could see me drive by damn twice this morning 😑. Ugh my anxiety is so bad. I always stop whenever I'm in accidents so idk. My anxiety is getting the best of me damnit. There was no damage to my car and none to the truck that I could see and I didn't feel or hear any damage.. I would think I would feel or hear it if I hit a car or something."
Anxiety,Should I stop telling everything to my mum when I'm not being understood?,"I (18m) am quite close to my mum in that I tell her whatever is on my mind. But her, being a typical South Asian parent, doesn't \*really\* understand mental health / anxiety / panic, and thinks I'm just being silly.

Then I regret telling her in the first place because it didn't help at all.

I also feel like me telling her every thing on my mind is giving her the idea that I am not ""strong"" or ""brave"". In contrast to my older brother who doesn't tell her everything and therefore is seen as more confident (even though I am sure he does have his individual stresses).

Also, there are things that I tell that aren't really appreciated, or I don't get the reaction I expect, or I'm told off, or I'm given unrelated advice, or she seems annoyed by me telling her...

I suppose the only person who only knows me is me. Some people just \*won't\* get it. 

On the other hand, if I don't tell her about something, she assumes I don't do it and therefore will give me a lecture about it. For example, the other day she was telling me off about not finding a job despite me being a student with exams in the next few weeks. Besides, I am already looking for one; I just haven't told her and don't see the need to.

What do you guys think?"
Anxiety,My thought process has changed re. My anxiety,"I’ve been reading a book about anxiety and panic disorders and there was a bit where it says, more or less : 

trauma and significant stress in someone’s life can cause a chemical imbalance in your brain resulting in severe anxiety and panic disorders later in life. It may SEEM like this condition has appeared out of nowhere but it’s actually been involving in your head for a while. 

It’s made me feel kind of sorry for myself and has made me sad to read this. I guess I knew this information already but reading it kinda brought it home. 

I had a horrible childhood and adolescence, been through things no teenager should ever have to go through. 

I’ve been looking after myself a lot more recently and talking to myself a bit nicer instead of hating myself for not feeling normal. Imagine you’re looking after someone you love who’s ill, imagine how gentle and loving you’d be to them. We need to do that to ourselves."
Anxiety,Weird anxiety after first dose of COVID vaccine,"I had my first dose yesterday. I was anxious beforehand, because medical stuff makes me feel anxious. And worried I'd be one of those cases where I had a bad reaction.  It's been 21 hours, and so far so good.....except I woke up at 4am and couldn't go back to bed and have been cleaning my house and I feel like I can't calm down and am so anxious.

I'm not really worried about the vaccine from yesterday, though about the second dose a bit because I know people can have unpleasant side effects for up to 48 hours.

I can't rule out that it's psychosomatic, but it doesn't feel like it....more it feels like when I've changed medications or doses of medications, this ultra hyper, jittery feeling like I drank an energy drink.  I'm curious about if the vaccine has some mental health side effects, or mental health med interactions that haven't been really noted yet....because everyone shrugged it off as psychosomatic.

I tried googling for results but either my google game is weak or there's not much out there yet."
Anxiety,I'm dreaming again (progress!) but dreams can be disturbing. How do you handle them?,"For years during the worst of my anxiety, I'd sleep but would rarely dream. Now, I'm doing much better due to a hypothyroidism diagnosis, more stable job, and a good deal of personal work. For the first time in close to 10 years, I again have the desire and capacity to want to do better at work (as opposed to the need to not fail), and to learn new things in my off time. Progress!!! 

The flip side is that now I have dreams that are much more obviously REM-type, where aspects of my daily life and thoughts get regurgitated at night: my brother's partner calls me as my brother has a heart attack; my partner and I escape a mass shooting at a vaccine center, only for her to get shot by a cop in the aftermath; I have a huge fight with my family during an Easter get-together. None of these things, or anything similar, has actually happened to me recently. 

I would love to be able to laugh at them, shake them off, and learn lessons about what is worrying me subconsciously. What's the right balance to strike between this path, and being concerned that these abstract things are getting to me so deeply?"
Anxiety,What is it about anxiety and depression that makes some of us not shower regularly?,"Why won’t I shower more than 3 times per week? I seem to convince myself that I don’t deserve it. Is this how others feel about it as well?

Anxiety,What to say to professor,"I was having an anxious morning, but I was trying to fight off what was going on. So, I drove to uni for class, but when I got there I started to have a panic attack. I just started to think about how if I went in it would make it worse, so I decided to go back home. What do I say to my professor over email to let her know of the situation? I’ve had to take “mental health days” before, and I am afraid that if I say this again she’s going to think I don’t care about her class or my work, and I’m just blowing it off. But, I’m also afraid that if I explain the situation in whole, it will be sharing too much? She’s pretty understanding normally, but I just feel bad because this is becoming kind of expected from me, and I feel like I’m letting her and myself down by not being able to go into class."
Anxiety,Any tips on how to deal with anxiety about my pet’s health?,"I have a long history with health anxiety but it’s getting better! However, lately my kitty had a couple of breathing issues and even though the vet has said he just has allergies flare ups, I can’t stop stressing about it! The tricks and techniques i usually use to calm myself down don’t seem to apply and i’ve gone back to googling (cat) symptoms and worrying about the worst...

Did anyone else go trough this with their pet? Is there anything I can do to fuss less about him? I’m afraid my anxiety is also making him nervous."
Anxiety,Can anyone relate to this?? I feel so alone.,"I will have days where my nose will randomly get stuffed up, then my throat feels like a lump in it, then my chest feels heavy/tight when breathing. This will 90% of the time send me into an anxiety riddled state or a full panic attack.

How do I manage this??? When my breathing gets like that, it feels like I’m breathing through a straw and it makes me light headed and dizzy. Then I think I need to get near a hospital, then my panic sets in and I’ll have a full blown panic attack. A Xanax will help the panic attack, but the breathing stuff still persists for a while.

Can anyone relate to this? I’ve already been cleared for not having asthma. I do have reflux/GERD and take omeprazole for it daily."

I haven't slept in 3 days because I'm scared if I fall asleep I'll have to wake up. I consider life to be meaningless."" I can't do this. I can't walk up there and lie that I'm fine and have several 'people' judge me based on that.  I don't know what to do. It is worth 4% so I think I should skip the class; let anxiety win this one."
Anxiety,Gonna be taking a mri scan tomorrow(claustrophobia),"So...I was asked to take a mri scan by my neuro I am scared of confined places, Idk if its to the extent that it can be considered as claustrophobia(never really was in a serious confined place for long), So this is giving me severe anxiety I am restless for a few hours now, I am on 0.25mg klonopin medication  so just for tomorrow I am planning to take 0.5 of it before the test, Do you think that would be sufficient to keep the claustrophobia away(I am not super claustrophobic I have slept in buses with place that can only fit in 2 people on top of each other and it was fully closed with curtains tho..) any other advice would be super helpful to me"
Anxiety,Opinions,"So I haven’t slept and I haven’t ate and weird things keep happening to my body, I physically can’t control it anymore my derealization is so so strong and the doom feeling I keep getting de ja vu aswell, I’m currently screaming shaking and crying I don’t feel panicky I just don’t feel here. I need help as soon as possible I’ve spoke to so many councelioirs over the phone etc but this is next level I’ve even called 111 etc but I am not in control I rlly want support in real life I’m only 16 in the uk, I feel like I need to go to a psych ward I don’t know what to do can anyone help me"
Anxiety,The cure for anxiety is... make peace with how u feel and accept it as much as u can and be happy with what u got 😎,I’m doing it and it works better than any of those anti anxiety meds nature has the cures not pharmaceuticals u just gotta look hard and u will see what I’m actually on about love ye all ❤️
Anxiety,"Feeling like a monster for saying ""no""","Since I'll be driving to a friend today their father asked me if I could get them something from Burger King, but my social anxiety kicked in immediately with intrusive thoughts, higher heart beats, etc.

Ultimately this led me to declining their wish and now I feel like I'm letting this person down, as well as my friend being dissapointed in me. I know that I'm allowed to say no to things, but I feel horrible for not having the guts to do this trivial task. So much so that I want to change my mind and say yes just to ""fix"" this scenario which i ruined, but my anxiety keeps me from doing so. Idk how to cope rn."
Anxiety,My moms cancer is back...,"Just had an extra horrible 2020 because my mom seemingly had cancer out of the blue, which made it all so challenging (i’m older and in my 30’s dealing with a lot of other shit). 

She finally got through all her chemo and radiation at the end of the year and there was so much relief felt. We had so many plans for this year. Then all the sudden a couple weeks ago she had pains in her stomach and the cancer had moved... 

Now it seems even worse and we get the results of everything in the next few hours and I feel like I’m going to throw up. All this progress and work we did last year is just gone away and this year might be the same or most likely worse.

I don’t know how to handle this. I’m already so weak from the year."
Anxiety,I don’t suppose these constant palpitations are shortening my lifespan?,They are annoying
Anxiety,Can I just not have anxiety attacks anymore?,My brain just searches for thoughts n fixates on them until it's resolved. My chest gets super tight. Yea I take a deep breath in but I still feel this increasing panic. Ocd or w.e I want practical solutions.
Anxiety,why do i still have tinnitus if i have no underlying health conditions?,"ive had tinnitus for three years and i can't figure out why. i can live with it, but it sucks. as far as i know ive gotten blood tests recently and all my levels r normals. is it because im overweight? i have no serious disease tho.. when i first got tinnitus i went gp and they checked my ears and wax or whatever and they said everything was normal so they transferred me to the hospital where i got a hearing test and i got perfectly normal on tht to then i had to go to another room where they asked me ""is this affecting ur day to day lifestyle?"" and i said ""no"" and they said well then theres nothing we can do sorry. they prescribed medicine but the line was long so i left and havent been back since. will it ever go away?"
Anxiety,This hell is eating my alive.,[removed]
Anxiety,I actually played a game with a group of friends,"I was very anxious to start with joining a group of friends on deep rock galactic at first me and my friend played together and then we moved on two a group of people. We don't chat on mic (chatting on mic is scary for me) My friend encouraged me to play with others and surprisingly I had a really great time, best time I've ever had in ages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I'm really scared to play games with groups of people, and normally just play singleplayer games. But it felt so great to actually play a multiplayer game with friends. Me and my friend now normally play together ""two of us"" i'm just so proud of myself for getting this far, when before being with a group of people would just be anxiety inducing for me."
Anxiety,I blame my dad for most of my anxiety,"And I know that might sound rude or stupid, but I think he started it. I’ve been wondering if I should post this and I just wanna list some of the things he’s done because it’s been making me feel worse. I have a step-mother because my dad remarried. She also causes my anxiety to skyrocket.


Basically they’ll make fun of me and my step sibling. Once I didn’t know what vegetable were in a stew thing I ate, so I said I left some of the green things and my step mum said “They’re vegetables [bowie], you probably haven’t heard of them.” And the two laughed like it was the best joke they’ve ever heard.

If we get sent out to do a job but don’t know where something is they’ll yell at us and maybe hit us if they’re mad, and probably say something like “Open your eyes!” Or to my step sibling “If you’d don’t learn how to look you’ll never keep a job.”

Once I feel off my bike onto gravel and got a huge cut on my arm. If had dirt and rocks in it and I tried my hardest to clean it and I couldn’t. They didn’t really care and we had to get back to doing our job or dragging tree branches into the fire pit. My step sibling tried to help and when I got back my mum helped me clean and bandage it, saying it could’ve got infected. (I’m dumb and don’t have much medical knowledge. Also I have no idea where any disinfectant things are there.)

I have asthma and they know this but they always smoke, even when I’m around. I understand they don’t have to stop *for* me, but I’ll be forced to stand or sit near them while they smoke because I’m not allowed to go inside because we might be eating.

I’m worried they hit my step sibling with objects because he’s there all the time. I know he used to hit me with objects (belt,slipper etc) but I don’t remember it. 

They also once made us work for 7 hours I think without a proper break in the hot sun and didn’t really let me get water, so I fainted the day after and hit my head on the wall. It might’ve been something else but that seemed to be what caused it.

Once we were packing up after camping and my step mum yelled “If you two don’t make yourselves useful you’ll both be in major trouble!” So we basically had to beg our friends we were camping with to let us help so we didn’t get yelled at/hit because we were standing around, even though they didn’t give us anything to do.


Thank you if you read this far. Sorry for sounding like a stupid little kid who doesn’t appreciate what they have. I know it isn’t that bad and I’m not there most of the time. And most of the major things happened last year or a few months ago."
Anxiety,Going back to school,"Covid has played a huge part in my anxiety, but in a positive way. I get to cover my face, not talk as much, not be seen, and I get to do my school online away from everyone. As things are slowing down it’s time for me to go back to my campus for tests. I want to skip them so bad and do them next year but if I skip I know I’m doing to disappoint my mom. She thinks my anxiety is fake and is just an excuse not to do things. I genuinely don’t think I can handle going back yet and I would like to wait to take my test till next year. I’m just worried I’m going to regret waiting because everyone else is doing it but at the same time I can’t see myself waking up tomorrow and walking that building. It’s not my time yet."
Anxiety,I'm a failure as human and as son.,[removed]
Anxiety,what the fuck is my problem?,"Actually no, I know exactly what my fucking problem is. It's called Generalised Anxiety Disorder and it deadlocks me in a place where I don't get anything - whether productive useful shit or self-indulgent entertainment - Done. And then feel like shit for not doing shit. 

I want to break the cycle but everytime I try it, the momentum I get from my pushes runs out and I start languishing again. It's been like this since I was 16 and I'm starting to worry it'll be like that forever.


Fuck me, who the hell made me exist, I'm not even having a good time."
Anxiety,It's blown up again,"I had a great three weeks without any significant flare up of anxiety and now with absolutely no warning I feel like I'm dying. I was so happy, and now I can't grab onto a single coherent thought and somehow it also feels like my mind is filled with cement and my bones with lead. I hate this, and I just need someone to talk to. I just want a hug, want to be told I'm going to be okay. I just want this to stop."
Anxiety,effects of getting covid and anxiety on people who already have GAD?,"Im reading a lot of reports of people basically getting anxiety disorders after being infected with covid. what are the implications of someone who already has the disorder, does it get worse? I'll basically be on the street if it gets worse."
Anxiety,Feeling of wanting to get away,"I apologize in advance for the somewhat long post ahead.

I have just had my first anxiety attack last week. As anxiety attacks are, it was sudden and my body went on full panic but because of my background in psychology I was able to eventually calm myself down and recover after a few minutes. For 2 months my dreams had all been anxiety provoking, my traumas and fears had all been depicted in each one: my dad and his mistress being happy, my younger sister being sick, my mother dying in my dream, me being cheated on, and many more. I expected the decline of my energy, there are days when I wake up and I am just in a bad mood, I don't want to speak and I just want to move so that I don't have to think. Coping like this had somehow alleviated my anxiety but I never expected to actually have an anxiety attack and when I did I didn't even want to admit that it was an anxiety attack, I wanted the doctor to say I have asthma even though I never had asthma. When I got examined for thyroid disease as a cause of me suddenly not being able to breathe, I also wanted it to be just that. I would have never wished to have an anxiety attack. I am scared by it, thinking about the word anxiety gives me more anxiety. 

The doctor was certain it was an anxiety attack and my mind kept repeating the word anxiety that I thought it was going to wear off its meaning; but it didn't. Instead, it made my hands and feet cold, my legs tremble, and it made me scared to breathe in. What worries me the most is that I don't know the cause of the attack, the doctor says fatigue but I am not tired. I work from home and my job doesn't take that much of a toll in my body. 

For months, I do believe I had a very peaceful life. I have been away from my family as they had been a source of distress for me for a long time and I live with my boyfriend with whom I've never really had a fight with. I have a stable job and an adorable cat. I just don't know what could've caused this and I am scared to even think that it has something to do with my past traumas or experiences. I like to think that although I have repressed most of it is that I am fine because I generally think I am.

Now I'm here and I am confused because a part of me wants to get away. I want to be alone for the meantime but I don't know where. I don't know what to tell my boyfriend because honestly, I'd rather deal with these things on my own, it's not his problem to address and I am not sure if he would fully understand.

I am worried that I do not know the source of this, that it might occur again, that I'd have to peel each repressed memory to get over it because I don't want to. I guess I'm here because I have no one I could really say this to.

Thanks."
Anxiety,How my boyfriend helped me with my anxiety,"My boyfriend of 7 years is not a very vocal person. The ""man of few words"" type of guy. In fact, the number of times he's said ""I love you"" is less than the years we've been together. And while not necessarily a BIG issue, sometimes, the lack of communication does cause me some anxiety.

Yes, I understand that it's just hard for some guys to express emotions and extend intimacy verbally. That's why I was surprised when he started a podcast. A podcast! What's even more surprising is the fact that he started his podcast as a way for him to tell me the things he wants to, but can't.

Let's just say that I'm seeing a whole new side to him. In this case, hearing.

Anyway, if any of you are in need of some encouragement, support, or maybe just a listening ear, please try out his podcast ""Boyfriend on Demand"" on Spotify. Because I know it's helped me understand him better and, of course, helped me rid of my anxieties regarding our relationship."
Anxiety,I hate myself so much and what I was.........,[removed]
Anxiety,Wanting to run away from everyone and everything,"Hey everyone, I lurk over here occasionally from time to time, and it's such a nice sub overall as far as I seen.
Well I have been struggling with anxious feelings a lot more after ""mentally aging"" and feeling like my life can be better and isn't right. And I haven't been diagnosed with any disorder yet, can't get therapy for some certain reasons.
The past few days after my 11 day break when I got back home, I'm not sure what I'm exactly supposed to do for my life and I feel like many things aren't right. And it lingers inside me, keeps me awake because when I try to sleep not doing anything.
Honestly even before break I would get this feeling too. 
I feel like I wanna run away from my life at home. It's uncertain, vague and lame mostly. And this feeling when I'm home won't let me at least feel relaxed enough to enjoy anything. (Or maybe the things I do have gotten boring?)
I'm not sure really what is the solution here to alleviate my anxiety.

Does anyone have any similar experiences? I would like to hear about it if you want to, and also advice is appreciated.

Thanks for taking the time to read this :)"
Anxiety,Always finding reasons to worry,It's really hard to explain this because my mind is in a constantly anxious state. I find I'll be anxious when I have a lot to do and when I get a break my anxiety gets even worse because I have more time to ruminate. The more I try to distract myself the stronger the thought of it trying to go away becomes and then it feels impossible. Usually I can't pinpoint what it is about but sometimes I go back and blame my bully from the past (even if I didn't care for several years about it) or I blame my parents for neglect. I'm not even sure who's fault it is. This anxiety comes most days but some days (rarely) it's gone.
Anxiety,"First time I threw up from anxiety, it has been weeks since I have felt normal.","I am in a very tough spot regarding school where I'm not sure if I'm going to graduate this semester. After meeting with my group a few days ago discussing the project, I muted my microphone and just started throwing up. Things have become too much for me to handle, maybe because it's online but It's making it harder for me to just enjoy anything right now. I just want to skip time to when I get my degree. I have no clue how to deal with this anxiety and I'm not sure if I can take another month of this.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Does anyone have any tips on how to handle this? I'm looking into therapy but having some trouble finding therapists near me accepting patients right now."
Anxiety,How do I help myself?,Can anyone bring me any advice to help me cope with daily anxiety attacks?
Anxiety,I'm having a bad day,I'm having really stressful day and i think im having an anxiety attack. Im having pain in chest and i feel sick in my stomach. My toughs are racing and i cant calm down. Its like everything bad that could happen just happened today.
Anxiety,I'm on the verge of tears right now.,"I've gone through a fucking lot thus far,up to and including the death of my dad last year..  


And now,I have to think about joining him in death...via china(specifically,they blowing us to hell with their nukes.)  


You see,I just watched two YT vids;One saying that we're head for a cold war with China..and then another goddamn vid that showed how a fucking nuclear war with China would look like.  


I...feel like I'm having a low-lever panic attack right now.  


IF FUCKING CHINA IS GONNA BLOW US THE FUCK UP,THEN GIVE ME A FUCKING GUN RIGHT NOW SO I CAN GO SEE MY DAD. LET ME BLOW MY FUCKING BRAINS OUT THEN. I AM NOT GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF THESE TWISTED MOTHERFUCKERS IN POWER!!!  


I..I feel so scared right now."
Anxiety,I cannot stop worrying about clothes moths,"My mind will not let it go, it's an obsessive worry stuck in my mind. My sister and I both have a few clothes moths and I got it somewhat under control but have to put as much of my clothing as possible in large ziplock bags. Whatever doesn't fit into a bag I have hung up but I worry about them getting eaten. The moths show up randomly - usually as soon as the weather warms up, and it literally keeps me up at night if I see one. Found one on my sweater just now, thought it was debris until I brushed it off and it flew away. I've lost a blanket and a good sweater to these f\*cking things before. I got moth balls once out of desperation but then after putting a whole bunch of clothing in a box with some of the month balls they weren't even salvageable from the horrible smell and I had to get rid of them. F\*cking hell man.

Does anyone else obsessively worry about like things being contaminated by small bugs or anything? It's so hard to let go of when it's actually happened. How do you deal with this anxiety?"
Anxiety,Got reminded of how I felt when my anxiety first started and now I’m terrified to ever feel that way again,My anxiety disorder got bad around summer of last year and the weather today reminded me of when I first started dealing with anxiety symptoms and didn’t know what was happening to me and I feel like I’ll revert to that again somehow even though I’ve developed coping mechanisms and learned about how to properly deal with it. Has anyone else experienced this? How do I reassure myself that I’ve grown and have made progress and that that’s in the past?
Anxiety,Sertraline meds not working?,"I've been taking Sertraline meds (25 mg) for the past 3 weeks, and one of the side effects is extreme fatigue. Another side effect is excessive yawning. Now I know that it could take up to 6 weeks to experience any relief from my anxiety, but I was just wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar experience. After speaking with my doctor, he offered to increase the dosage to 50 MG. However, I suspect that will just worsen the side effects. If anything, my anxiety has worsened."
Anxiety,"I have a math test in 3 hours and im SO anxious. well, im always anxious, but now even moreso. what do",
Anxiety,Just avoided a panic attack more successfully than I ever have,"A couple hours ago I avoided a panic attack that I knew was coming, and now I feel great. For some details, my anxiety has been awful lately. I had COVID and while it was a very mild case, I've been having the ""brain fog"" which has been giving me bad disassociation and making my other anxiety symptoms worse.
This morning my indigestion problems were pretty bad and I began disassociating again, which was not good because I had to leave for work in less than 10 minutes, so I decided to get up and walk a couple paces in my backyard. This helped a little bit, but the other issue is I had to take an Uber for work. When I feel a panic attack might be coming, being in a car is the worst because I feel trapped...which obviously makes the panicking come sooner and more extreme.
But again, I just called the Uber and soon after that he arrived. While I was in the car, still disassociating, I decided to put my hand on my wrist and feel my pulse, look outside and take in my surroundings, and breathe slowly. Before I knew it I was calming down and I felt normal again, and everything after that was easy. Lucky for me too because the driver missed an exit and got lost, and if I had been panicking then that may have been the worst one of my life.

Anyway, just wanted to share this with all of you since I know we're all going through the same things and I wanted people to remember it's possible to take control of this and not let the idea of it take you over."
Anxiety,I swear the most debilitating symptom of anxiety is the feeling of helplessness,"when anxiety gets overwhelming and you just feel helpless is the absolute worst. it’s like a hole you can’t climb out of. it’s frustrating because i understand that my anxiety thoughts are irrational but i still am so scared of them. sometimes i feel like i’m just afraid of the world in general and that’s scary. same exhausting cycle. just to be clear i absolutely am not contemplating suicide, i don’t even think i could bring myself to do it if i wanted to. can anyone else relate?"
Anxiety,Started seroquel xr anyone uses too ?,I'm already on prozac 40mg and gabapentin and my psy gave me seroquel xr for anxiety/insomnia/OCD starting at 50mg up to 150mg and took 50mg yesterday and I feel so sleepy today. Is it always going to be this sedating ? I feel so sedated my energy is at 0 and I have to go up to 150mg. I drank a coffee but it doesn't do anything. I'm already depressed and lazy I don't want to be like a vegetable maybe it's normal at first I don't know about that medication. Thank you :) !

Anxiety,My work makes me super anxious a lot of the time.,[removed]
Anxiety,How has anxiety affected your career?,"I've basically settled into a boring entry level position because I'm afraid I couldn't handle the stress of anything more. I generally consider myself lucky my anxiety isn't so bad I can't work at all, but I sometimes get self-conscious about it."
Anxiety,I just had an anxiety attack and I'm so tired of living like this,"I'm a 32F and for all accounts, my life seems to be good enough. I have a good career, a nice apartment, good friends, family, two pets. I'm smart, I'm good at my job whenever I find the motivation to do it. But I just feel so so tired of being trapped in this cycle of never-ending struggle. I've been in therapy for the past 4 years, and I know It has helped as it allowed me to make some decisions like leaving a relationship it wasn't working, pursuing a better job, moving to another country.

But its like nothing matters and I can't just help feeling like shit most of the time. I'm stressed and anxious almost every day. I feel like I'm just trapped and I can't get out. I like my job but the current situation mixed (covid) together with other things (moved to new country, higher stakes at work, my ex works in the same company as me, fear in general) makes me super anxious and zero motivated to do it. I live in fear of being discovered as an ""impostor"" and being fired. Most days I just do the bare minimum to get by, I procrastinate a lot and just cram all my tasks last minute. Funny thing is, people tell me I'm doing good! I just need ""a little more focus"". 

Most of my energy goes into keeping my life afloat. I feel like shit, I feel like I can't do anything right. Is like trying to push a boulder up a hill. Today I was feeling mostly blah, but I was trying to get it under control. I decided to go train as my head was nagging me for not being productive today and as I started to getting dressed, I realized I couldn't find my gym towel, my bottle wasn't ready, my gym lock was missing.... and I just started crying. I was not panicked, it was more a feeling of pure frustration and rage at the fact that no matter what I do, no matter how much I try I just can't do better for myself. I feel like I'm an unreliable person to myself, that I'm just not good enough, not doing enough.

And I can't anymore. I don't want to keep living my life like this, feeling like this. I honestly don't know what to do because I do have good days and I do get burst of motivations from time to time but it's never permanent and it scares me that I will never find some sort of stability.

I just want to quit everything. But I can't. Even tho I have good friends and family, I live alone in another country. I can't just quit my job and do what? Plus I feel this will solve the anxiety temporarily but not permanently.

I just want to feel normal. I want to feel like I can live my life and enjoy it and do things without being so anxious and tired all the time."
Anxiety,RMT found a small bump on my neck during a massage,"Health anxiety sucks. I went to get a nice relaxing massage today, and she brought up a small bump on the back of my neck. I think it's either a cyst or a swollen lymph node. I called to schedule an appointment with my GP. I'll continue to monitor the size of it, but I'm definitely freaking out a bit. I'm grateful she brought it up."
Anxiety,I deserve everything i got.,"No physical contact, no normal friendships, abuse in school, bad relationship with other people, being phycologists for everyone and hold my shit inside, ok, i deserve it, yes, i am punch bag and trash can"
Anxiety,Starting my first dose of medication for anxiety and depression.,I start taking BUSPRONE and Lexapro not sure how it’s gonna affect me or if it’s even going to work but I’ve taken so many other things and nothing is working :( I feel like this is a last resort and I’ve thought about self harm because I don’t feel human any more. I just can’t get rid of this feeling of doom and gloom all the time.
Anxiety,How to handle ''Eating at the night'' thing?,"Since I suffers from Panic Attacks, one of the things i really hate of the most is that I can't stop eating at the night. Doesn´t let me to do a proper diet while doing exercises, and brings me problems in my house for eating all the market goods of the week. I try to have an acknowledge that I am having a panic attacks and breathe, but this stop me for a little, and in the next hour its come back. Also, I try to do what some nutricionist told, of doing fast after the 6 PM, but then this only bring me thoughts of that I have to eat because I didn't do the dinner. Please help me, really want to control that."
Anxiety,What triggers anxiety attacks,I always feel like no one likes me
Anxiety,advice for someone taking sertraline (tw recreational drug use),"have just been prescribed sertraline for anxiety and am kind of terrified tbh. The side effects look scary and I'm worried about taking drugs on them (am a uni student who takes them quite regularly recreationally). I know someone who can't take MDMA as it doesn't effect them? I feel like the doctor didn't really give me that much information, she just said they're like a plug stopping the serotonin from running out. Lliterally any advice would be appreciated. Thanks xox"
Anxiety,Help!,I haven't had a good night's sleep and I'm worried a lot thinking there's something wrong with me. My anxiety is off the roof.
Anxiety,I signed a form wrong...,"I'm in the process of moving rental properties. Part of this requires an employment reference. I made the mistake of putting permanent instead of contract for my employment type - I've just received the letter of employment confirmation from my employer and of course it says I'm on contract! 😩

I'm a graduate so at the end of my two years I get moved into one role (I currently do placement rotations) and it just didn't occur to me that my two years classed as a contract and not permanent...super stupid of me and I was just on auto pilot and filled in the drop-down wrong 

I'm so mad at myself because now my anxiety is sky-high because I know there's inconsistencies, and I know it's just down to me being so panicked by having to complete a form where they say you can be fined if the info is wrong (my absolute worst nightmare) and ironically I went and filled the bloody thing in wrong!!! Arrggghhhhh..."
Anxiety,I got anxiety meds?,"I'm quite surprised, I just went into an appointment, and walked out with a prescription. 



So basically, I've been trying to get meds for years, the last person I talked to said that I would be prescribed meds IF I did therapy alongside them. I did the therapy, they changed it to needing to FINISH the therapy before getting them. I finished the therapy. Then it was ""Pshhh, you don't need meds, you did therapy!""


My anxiety has definitely gotten better, but it's still hindering my life, and even prevented me from seeing a doctor for eight months (I had weird lumps that I needed to get checked)


And since I'm starting college soon, I really need those meds.


Then finally, I see a new person about it, and she spends ten minutes talking, and getting a bit of info on what I'm hoping for, ten minutes explaining what the medication does, and the side effects.


Then she asks me to pick between the two that are used for people my age, and I picked the most common one, thinking that I'd be having a few more appointments, or at least another hour of talking before medication was actually even considered.


But guess what? She got up and said ""Alright, well I'll just go grab your prescription.""


Like...Wha? Huh? I didn't even say anything, I spent the whole tome nodding my head, and leading my mum speak for me. The last few times I did that, I got rejected HARD.


So now I have a pack of anxiety meds, and I'm going to start taking them tomorrow.


I had to choose between starting anxiety meds and ADHD meds, because doing both at the same time would be difficult, since you wouldn't know which one is causing which side effect, so I'm going to go back after I've adjusted to these.


I did not expect to get any medication today, after years of jumping through hoops, I started to think that I wouldn't get anything until I was an adult. Perhaps it's because I'm going to be seventeen next month, that they thought it would be fine to give me them?


I'm just very surprised. 


I mean, like, what? Finally???


I'm excited to try them, I hope they work out for me. I just needed to talk about this."
Anxiety,Struggling to speak,When my anxiety kicks into overdrive (especially when I’m at school) I physically cannot speak. Like I open my mouth and try to talk and nothing comes out. It’s gotten to the point where I get yelled at because my mom and teachers think I’m purposely not answering and I don’t know what to call this. I feel like no one believes me when I tell them I’m trying but I can’t push the words out. It’s like there’s a disconnect between my brain and my mouth. It only happens when I’m really anxious or in a stressful situation but I can’t control it when it happens and I can’t even force myself to speak. Does anyone know what this is or how to make it stop?
Anxiety,Medications!!! What has worked for you/what hasn’t?,"I’ve taken cymbalta for past 2.5 years, just added buspirone a month ago for anxiety. I take Xanax .25 as needed."
Anxiety,What helped you?,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 year old male who has a mild speech disorder and have suffered from depression and mostly anxiety. At times I would wake up heart pounding since the moment I opened my eyes til about 4:30 pm pretty much just contemplating the purpose of life while handling responsibilities or working out. I was a functional anxious/depressed person. I could still get good grades and be active while suffering. I was wondering because you hear all these stereotypical ways of relieving anxiety such as sleep better, exercise, set goals, etc. I was curious, if you have lessened your anxiety by any extent, how did you do it? For me since I have a speech disorder I first exempt myself from presentations and that did wonders for my mental health. Usually if I had a school presentation my life would be in shambles 3 months leading up to it in pure terror of maybe stuttering or not being able to say a word right. But I did presentations for literally my whole life and by facing your fears you supposedly become more braver and that I feel just isn't the case with anxiety (for me anyways). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been to therapy and they told me I had social anxiety (in reality I have speech anxiety due to the disorder) but I also just have general anxiety and I truly feel it is impacting my life negatively because I seem less competent because of it. I have literally tried everything to combat my anxiety - I have been taking a speech program which seems to help and bring more security to me, but I have tried CBD, marijuana, wine at night, exercising hard, eating right, sleeping well and consistently, etc. and although it brings temporary relief, I still have an existential angst every single day. Is it normal what I am going through?

What helped you to become less anxious/socially anxious?"
Anxiety,Paranoid of health issues,I feel like every week there is a new health concern I can’t stop thinking about. I’m a generally healthy person and usually nothing is wrong. This week i’m petrified I have a UTI. I’ve gotten them before and have gone to the doctors for tests two times already this year because i’m paranoid. I’m scared that my kidneys will shut down.
Anxiety,"DAE hate being full, because it causes nausea which is an anxiety trigger for me","tw: ED, emetophobia, fainting

Don’t remember the last time I ate till I was full. Besides right now because it made me want to ask this. I get so anxious I feel like I’m going to pass out, then have to lay down and breathe and convince myself I won’t throw up. Probably emetophobia. 

I didn’t even eat that much. I just think about it too much. I basically gave myself an eating disorder.

Anyone else?"
Anxiety,"Worried about my wife, but I want to be supportive","My wife has had cancer in the past. She had surgery, but it came back. She had another surgery, and now it’s been 5 years. She has a biopsy tomorrow because of her most recent ultrasound. This is what happened 5 years ago. She had a biopsy and they discovered cancer.

I’m in a tough spot because my anxiety is going crazy. I’m able to share this with my wife, but she’s worried herself. I don’t want to burden her with my worry. So it’s a tough balancing act of letting my emotions out, but also staying strong and remaining stoic for my wife.

I know a biopsy doesn’t mean anything in itself, I just can’t help but worry, especially since we have a young child now. Ugh, it just sucks. This isn’t unreasonable to worry about, I just wish I had better control over it."
Anxiety,I keep feeling nauseous in the mornings due to anxiety?,"Please help. I’m in a rough program at my school. Ever since I started, I kept getting morning sickness. Sometimes I lack motivation because I feel like I can’t do it although I’ve been surviving so far."
Anxiety,😞,I had to call off work at my new job twice in one month bc of my habits and mental health . Idk why they get so mad at me when I told them I’m sick. I feel so guilty like they don’t even really care about me there. I tried my hardest to sound genuine and get someone to cover my shift. I’m not well and they don’t even know what I’m going thru just think I’m trying to get out of working bc I’m lazy probably. Maybe someone will notice that it’s always a Monday after I’m off two days . Maybe I don’t even need to work there . Why is this happening to me I feel so awful for this. I thought It would be easier than It was bc of how much I’m dealing with already. That place made me feel confident in social setting again . I don’t wanna let them down . I don’t wanna hurt anyone’s business but I cant work in these conditions . My anxiety  is so bad now bc of how they reacted . Ugh hard lesson again
Anxiety,"Help, I can't sleep well.","Every night I start to feel my hands, feet, head and neck warm, it is something uncomfortable and it does not let me sleep, I do not know if it is anxiety or something else, does anyone know what I can do to solve it?"
Anxiety,why do crying children trigger me?,every time i hear a crying child i almost get a panic attack. it gives me the worst feeling in the world and it makes me want to run. what does that mean? how can i fix it?
Anxiety,Work stress,"I am 16 doing a levels and i’m so stressed out. I feel like i’m behind on all my work.
I can’t physically get any work done cause i get so anxious about it.
The thought of going back to school next week isn’t helping either.
Any tips?"
Anxiety,"Anxiety attacks, hospital and sedatives?","In the country you guys live, how does it work? If I have an attack can I got to hospital and get tranquilizer/sedative in my vein until I calm down or sleep? Cause that doesn't happen at all in my country"
Anxiety,Self-medication to actually addressing the problem.,"I've got an appointment later today with my GP to discuss upping my Prozac dosage after 6 weeks on 10mg daily. Figure it's as good a time as any to introduce myself to this subreddit I've been lurking for months, and just to give my experience. Reading other's experiences on here helped me with medication hesitancy. So, here's the journey so far:

I was a heavy nicotine user from age 17 up until 3 months ago when a minor cardiac episode exposed a minor heart defect, thus forcing me to quit cold turkey. I was literally pounding down about 4 pack of cigarettes worth of nicotine every day (Vaping high strength juice). It had been 13 years since I had less that a pack of cigarettes worth of nicotine in my system. It wasn't until after I was forced to quit that I realized I was self medicating my anxiety. Now I'm on a low dose of Prozac with plans to up my dosage if my doctor agrees (appointment on Monday).and it's life changing.

The best way I can describe it is that my rational brain is always puppeteering my body and lizard brain with a bunch of strings. And my anxiety is like an ultra-sharp knife slicing through all of these strings at once. My rational brain knows that there's zero (or very little) reason to worry or panic. But it no longer has any control over the my body or the less ration portions of myself. Sometimes that baser side of me will become obsessive, or violent (thankfully, I've never lost control to the point of physically harming another living being), or even go into a full blown panic attack; complete with vomiting, full body shakes, etc. All along, my rational side is powerlessly flailing to reign myself back in

Basically, I was using nicotine as a rescue inhaler. Whenever the anxiety knife would cut the strings, nicotine was like firing super strong grappling hooks with steel cables to catch my primal brain long enough for my rational brain to tie its normal, natural puppeteering strings back together. Now, on my Prozac, it's a totally different approach. The knife still swings just as hard just as accurately, and just as often, but it's just a **little** bit blunted. Just enough that it doesn't quite cut through some of the puppeteering strings. Thus giving me enough time to pull the surviving strings out of the way of the next swing, or to attach new natural strings. My hope is that by upping the low dosage I'm on. The knife blade of anxiety gets blunted even more, or maybe swing less hard, or even stops swinging so goddamn often.

As for side effects, I've fortunately only had two minor, easily controlable ones: The first being a drastically elevated appetite. I packed on 15 pounds in about a month before I realized. But I'm handling it now with willpower alone.

The other side effect is my sleep is... Just as bad when unmedicated, but in a different way? I never remembered it, but apparently (according to my partner) I thrashed around a lot before I started the Prozac, never remembered my dreams, slept through the night, and I rarely felt super well rested in the mornings.

Now, after starting Prozac. I'll wake up in the middle of the night (like right now in fact, it's 12:45am and I went to sleep at 9pm, up for work at 5am). I'm remembering my dreams a lot more. I think that's a sign that my REM isn't as high quality? Checking with my doc on Monday. But even with all that. I feel more well rested than I have in years. I've just adjusted to my sleeping periods being two ~3.5 hour naps. Other than those. I'm feeling better now than I have in years!"
Anxiety,Pls universe release this pain from me,I learned my lesson:( I don’t think this is doing anything for me but hurting my soul now . What did u do wrong ? I was selfish and didn’t go to work bc I wanted to do coke and help ppl feel better in Reddit . Wtf is the point of this lesson I can’t understand the amount of pain I go thru alone . Please release me from It.
Anxiety,"Ever feel like your anxieties are compounding, making you more anxious to try to fix things, but staying the same is anxiety inducing too? [TW: death]","Hey, I guess I just need to vent to people who might understand me, because I don't want to bother my friends with this stuff

I just have so much anxiety that I want to die. I feel like I can't have a functioning life because of it. I recently had a run in with a girl that I was really into and she seemed into me (which is insane tbh), things didn't go well with her ignoring me and I just spent the weekend on the verge of throwing up constantly. I'm 27 and haven't gotten further than an (unwanted) kiss, and that compounds my anxiety.

Truthfully, the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I live with my parents, and I've relegated myself to my room... But garbage bags have just piled up and it's awful, and if I were to die they'd have to clean it out

Hilarious right? My squalor gives me anxiety, I can't get it out of the house because I'm anxious my mom is going to yell at me for even HAVING this much trash... And the only thing I want is to die, but I'm anxious they'll have to clean everything up

Lmao. Anyone else completely stuck like this?

Or advice."
Anxiety,Constant feeling of dread is debilitating,"I wake up with no reason to feel this way. But I dread that I will lose my job. That everything will crumble and what's the point in planning. Small tasks seem so daunting and I just shut down. I know I suffer from anxiety and I know that not all of it is ""valid"" (meaning my brain is tricking me and its not actually something happening) but I can't shut it off. And its debilitating. I try to do long exhales to help my parasympathetic nervous system and it hasn't helped when I've need it to yet. Anxiety is just exhausting and it steals precious time away. Which then makes me crabby."
Anxiety,does anybody else have a random uncomfortable vibe about places?,like it doesn’t really make sense but everywhere i go something gives me a certain vibe and even if it’s a perfectly normal place i get a bad vibe from it and it feels weird. it’s the same for like wanting to go on walks but my neighborhood feels very strange to me so i hate going on them.
Anxiety,I feel stupid :(,"Last night everything was fine, I was calm and happy after work, but then out of nowhere I started to get SUPER dizzy and confused! My heart was racing as well, I thought I was dying/going crazy. I wasn’t sure what was happening so I told my husband that I wanted to go to the emergency room. 

Well, an hour drive and $1,500 later I was told I had a massive panic attack.

I’m upset that I not only spent that much money but that I’m going to have a big medical bill to pay off because of a fucking panic attack. Yes, now I know what they are and what they feel like, but that doesn’t make it any better. :( 

Any advice on the panic attacks? I have anxiety but this was my first panic attack and it came out of nowhere! Literally I was calm and happy!"
Anxiety,Weather and Anxiety,Am I the only one who finds themselves happier and less anxious during the winter? Like when temperatures drop I don’t stress as much?
Anxiety,Read the bible Matthew 6 beginning at verse 26,I saw someone sharing about this on another subreddit. My mind is so at ease after reading these verses. I hope it helps.
Anxiety,Recently started Ativan,[removed]
Anxiety,Weird Symptom,People always say that anxiety is the overestimation of a threat and an underestimation of the ability to cope. I don’t think that most of my situations are overestimated bc of my part situations but I definitely have an underestimation of my ability to cope. I don’t even envision myself living past an event that I am anxious about like I can’t think past it or make any plan after it bc in my head I just disappear or randomly die like I just simply don’t exist after the event happens. That’s how bad my underestimation of my ability to cope is.
Anxiety,anxiety and panic attacks,"I have been having heart palpitations for 2 years and and I got even worse lately, I have been on all heart test and I cant be more healthier but still I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, legs, arms, head...and lately I ve been having chest pain on left side and acid reflux problems, did anyone got rid of heart  pounding forever?

And yes I have anxiety and I have every once and a while a panic attack."
Anxiety,Anyone else got an Emotional Support Plush/Object?,"I have one. My mom bought it for me. Her name is Ellie Williams, she's one of my role models I grew up with from The Last of Us. Here's a pic of her: https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/hfcqg4/look_guys_my_mom_got_me_a_little_ellie_plush_when/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Whenever I feel lonely, sad, or have hallucinations/paranoia episodes I always cuddle it and things feel a lot better. Growing up I looked up to her so much. Ever since I was 8 I wanted to be as tough and smart as Ellie!

Also... my mom bought me a golden ring with 2 opals in it. The infinity signs stands for how her love for me is infinite and the words ""Ur Worth it Luv"" is engraved in it. Makes me feel special..."
Anxiety,Its going to be alright,"Good morning, friend.  

I just wanted to remind you that you're worth it.  You are loved.  Your time on this earth, your efforts, and your beauty are an important part of this world.   I encourage you to step out to say hello to someone, even if it's someone you already know.  Smile.  That's all it takes.

I hope your morning, your day, or even your week is fantastic and full of laughter."
Anxiety,I cant breathe. I need help,I can't breathe I can't breathe. Trauma flashbacks. I don't know how to stop and there's no one to help. I feel extremely alone. And I can't breathe. Didn't sleep at all last night I have work tomorrow. I tried grounding exercise it didn't work. I need help. Please help me
Anxiety,school is quite literally killing me,"why won't they understand how hard it is now. why won't they understand school isn't as easy as it was for them. they didn't even finish high school, and they have a perfect life now. why do they expect such insane things from me.

I'm so tired of everyone expecting things from this barely functioning human. I can't go anywhere without having shaky anxiety attacks and heavybreathing, how can you even expect me to get out of bed. all I do all day is fantasize about killing myself and hoping something really bad happens, so I can finally get the courage to do it.

I am so tired"
Anxiety,Irrational Fear of Being Kidnapped,"So I'm a 17 year old male, I've suffered from anxiety since I was about 11. I had extreme social anxiety, but I've been working on that and I'm fine with public interactions with strangers and being in crowds now. Only problem is when I'm outside without anyone around (friends, family, or strangers) I have this extreme fear that someone's going to pull up in their car or something and kidnap me. Idk why and I try to calm myself down but nothing works.

Last night I was skateboarding in an empty parking lot alone at about 11 PM. A grey station wagon pulled into the parking lot and was driving towards me, so I jumped on my board and skated away as fast as I could, only to look behind me and see that the car turned down another road that was linked to that parking lot. I felt like such a dumbass lmao.

Any tips on how to stop thinking like this? I love going outside alone at night but this really stresses me out."
Anxiety,Nervous tics?,"Like the title says, I tend to twitch during a nervous state. I've been seeing this guy for about a couple months and we went on 2 dates already. But both times I was making clicky noises, winking, shrugging, etc. I think it's a side effect of my meds but I just want to know if anyone can relate to this??"
Anxiety,How to deal with Mondays,"The repetition, the stress, the monotony, the endless cycle, it’s painful. I can breathe on Saturday but then Sunday i panic and Monday is like being smacked in the face by a whale"
Anxiety,Helpful long term medication for anxiety and PTSD?,"I'm diagnosed with chronic anxiety and PTSD. 

I have experienced the symptoms of anxiety since I was maybe 14 (22 now), and I have only in the past year been diagnosed with PTSD.

I am going to psychology sessions to talk through my issues, which has helped. I also live a healthy lifestyle (exercise, clean diet, etc). 

However, it doesn't matter how good things might be, everyday I feel like I am fighting with myself to feel relaxed and normal.

I'm really interested in others experiences with medications (prescribed or otherwise) to treat anxiety.

A few years ago, I was prescribed SSRIs to treat depression. I was only on it for 2 months, as I stopped taking them once I felt healthier. 

However, unlike depression (which was induced by my previous abusive relationship and MDMA overuse), my anxiety is chronic and I will try anything at this point to feel better.

After doing research, I'm not really interested in benzos (as much as they feel great), purely because they apparently can leave you worse off. 

Ive tried CBD and that really helped, but I'm from Australia, so it's very inaccessible and expensive (I paid $200 for 30ml 1000mg). 

As I mentioned earlier, Ive tried SSRIs but they didn't really ease my anxiety, just the depression.

I'm interested to learn from others experiences with medications for long term treatment"
Anxiety,Thoughts on emotion journals,Just wanted to get opinions on emotion journals. Yes? No? Does it help?
Anxiety,friend visited for the weekend - disaster,"I was starting to feel like I was somewhat learning to work with my social anxiety, and had recently even been considering trying to date again.  Well, a friend came and visited me for the weekend.  I was completely lost in a torrent of self conscious thoughts and anxiety the entire time.  It was terrible.  Yesterday we just ended up watching TV from like 2pm until 11pm when I went to bed and I was too anxious to converse or suggest playing a game or anything.  So terrible.  I don't know how people hang out.  The only reason I used to be able to was because I would binge drink every time.  Now that I don't drink alcohol it just seems impossible to spend much time with anyone.  All I can handle is maybe like a 30 minute walk then I need to retreat to the couch and lay there and get tortured by obsessions and anxiety"
Anxiety,"Hey there - for those of you who have been on anti-anxiety/depression meds, what have your experiences been like, both positive and negative?","I have had GAD for most of my life and have recently been considering going on medication to help with it. However i’m very hesitant of the short term and lasting side effects of something like an SSRI. I’m curious to know others experiences with such medication, and if they are happy or they regret going on them."
Anxiety,Idk how im getting out of this,"Depression had been the main problem, a year ago I ended an obsessive relationship and it has been hard for me to overcome it. something also happened to me last year that made me feel insecure and afraid of the world in general. Today I have not felt that I am alive for almost 3 weeks, I don't even feel sad, I just can't shut my mind, I can't stop thinking about everything. These days I'm waiting for something catastrophic to happen to me, and this anxiety has caused me to distance myself from my family and from all the people I know, even yesterday I broke up with my girlfriend just because neither of us thought it was a good idea for us to continue. As long as I felt like this In my career I am going fatal and it is impossible to pay attention, my relationships are crumbling and every time I feel more alone, and all because of something that is surely in my head. I don't know what I expect when I tell all this but I just wanted to share (sorry for the bad English)
Thank you for reading and I hope u guys have a great week, first time using Reddit and its good watching all the support in this sub :)"
Anxiety,Receiving a letter from someone I don't know,"So, I end up with triggered anxiety from certain things. One big one is someone unexpectedly knocking on my door or thinking I missed someone who knocked on my door while I was away. I installed a door cam that will send a notification to my phone when someone has activated it. That has helped a bit. Another is opening the mailbox and finding a letter that I can't automatically guess what it is. I signed up for informed delivery thinking that it may help for me to know what is coming, but I think it may be making things worse. Instead of worrying when I open the box and see it, I see it in advance and have to wait to open it and find out what it is. Granted, these things dont actually happen that often.

But my problem for today is... I am receiving a piece of mail, addressed specifically to me from someone I do not know. I looked up the address and it is a residential address, not a business, that is less than ten miles from me, so that does not give me any more of an idea of what it may be. I even tried a Facebook search to no avail. The more I think about it, the more disturbed I am getting that this random person knows my name and my address and is for some reason sending me something. I am practically a recluse. Outside of my immediate family, I don't have really anything to do with anyone or any organization that would have given out my address. I actually make a pretty big point of guarding my address and my privacy in general. 

Anyway, so I am in a total panic as to what this may be and how it came to be and I have almost another 5 hours until the usual time the mail carrier gets here and I don't know what to do outside of come on here and rant about it."
Anxiety,What is it about getting a shot?!,"I hate them. I hate them. I can feel the needle under my skin and the liquid they inject and it lasts forever. Having an Iv is the worst I'll just refuse to ever move because I can *feel* it under my skin.

I just got a flu shot and it's not even the pain but I am gagging over the feeling of it. They make me SO uncomfortable."
Anxiety,I just need to say it and maybe have ppl relate? TW,"Tw: I’m gonna talk about fear of being a victim of homicide 

I genuinely just need to vent in a place where I think people could relate. 
So the backstory is I’ve had anxiety since I can remember, my parents are divorced and when I was in 4th grade I used to make myself throw up so that I didn’t have to leave my mom, I thought if I left her she would die and if I was with her I would be gone too so I wouldn’t have to go live with my dad. I went to a therapist, I didn’t like him and haven’t gone to one since. My mom has her own problems, my sister has worse problems and so my anxiety was just something I kind of dealt with and it didn’t get in the way too often. 

Fast forward I’m now 24, I grew up in a nice suburb but I’ve lived in a big city in a not great neighborhood for about 4 years now. I’ve always been scared of break ins, I don’t like to be home alone, I can’t sleep if i’m home alone, etc. I used to be pretty into true crime because I was fascinated with the mind behind the crime but in the past 2 years I’ve started thinking about it as if I was the victim and now I’m convinced that something terrible is going to happen to me. I barely leave my house because I’m scared someone will pick me, follow me home and then do something terrible to me. I have a big dog, I’m armed and I have multiple people who live in my house but I can’t like stop myself from thinking about it. 

Last night is when I realized this is a huge problem. I was laying in bed, it was about 1am and I was about to fall asleep when I started thinking about all the ways someone could break in, if I would be able to hear them if they did break in, etc. The worst part was that I couldn’t stop thinking that no matter what I did, no matter how I armed myself or came up with a plan, if being a victim of a terrible crime was going to happen to me it was gonna happen to me. I felt the blood drain from my face, I started shivering, my legs started shaking, I felt like it was about to happen to me even though it wasn’t and it didn’t. I ended up not being able to sleep, I felt like if I fell asleep I would wake up to something horrible. I ended up just patrolling my house occasionally to make sure no one was in here until like 4am I eventually fell asleep by accident and slept through the night. 

I’ve stayed awake all night before when no one was home because I wasn’t sure I would wake up if someone were to break in but I’ve never done this when everyone was home. I don’t know why it just keeps getting worse, I just keep getting more paranoid. I went so long without letting my anxiety dictate how I live and now it’s all I can think about. I told my mom thinking she would understand but she kept telling me that I just need to face my fears and leave the house doing little things but it’s not that I’m afraid of leaving my house it’s that I’m afraid of what could happen to me later as a result of going outside if that even makes sense. 

Idk I don’t feel like anyone in my life truly understands and Idk if anyone in this sub will either but I just needed to vent this out."
Anxiety,alternate measures to treat anxiety,"I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a few days but it makes me angry and it makes me feel very bad knowing that I cannot overcome this on my own, but taking into account that I have everything to be happy, and although surely I can no longer do this, I would like to know that if you know about other ways to deal with anxiety? Mainly spiritual  stuff, Like meditation  (srry for bad English)"
Anxiety,I just got my first full-time job!!!!,"Because of my anxiety, I wasn't able to secure a full-time position anywhere. It was either part-time or temporary jobs. After years of being unable to find one, I finally, *finally* was able to get my first full-time job. Which they offered me right on the spot and I took it! To say I feel ecstatic isn't the word to do it justice."
Anxiety,I hate living like this..,"I get anxious nearly every day. I’ll get super tired and yawning, light headed, shallow breathing, feeling stuffed up, tight throat, and just overall anxious. This will last anywhere from 30min to a few hours. Sometimes I’ll take a Xanax to avoid a panic attack. I take 5mg Lexapro daily to just take the edge off, but some days I get like I am right now with the above symptoms."
Anxiety,Help helping spouse,"Hello all,  I’m looking for help, how do I help wife with her anxiety issues.  I’m trying really hard to be supportive because I love her so very much.  She knows it’s an issue, and is talking on the phone to a therapist. 

Birds eye view
She has never been a go getter, always needs a nudge to keep moving, basic things like, bathing regularly, housework, child care, cooking cleaning.  Let me be 100% clear, these are not tasks/chores I see as exclusively her jobs.  We were both employed full time when we married, we talked about each other’s expectations/needs and delegate work load as needed.  So the things I listed are things we were both supposed to do regularly and that she was just not keeping her to her word.  At first I thought it was laziness and getting comfortable in the married life.  So after a few years of pushing my own feelings down inside we started taking much more and agreed to do our part without letting the other down. 

We now have 3 kids 4,8,10.  Wife is home running a small business and doing the home mom thing which is great because it’s always been a goal of ours.  After years of her hating her job she finally gets to be a stay at home mom and she gets to take care of the home... her dream.

So here we are in the life we both dreamed of Her crippling anxiety is affecting everything she wants to do.  Constant procrastination, She has panic attacks over her health, keeping her from even coming to bed at night.  Some days she just lounges in PJs all day long.  (cool once in a while).  We’ve talked about this a few times, she maintains that she really is trying.  I’ve taken varied approaches, and it usually ends with her feeling incredibly guilty and in tears before I can even get through half of the things I need to get off my chest.  She tells me to talk about how I feel, but when I do it breaks her.  And it hurts me knowing that I’m hurting her, at the same time hurting our relationship because things get put on the back burner.  I’m not sure what to do.  We’re not in the brink of divorce or anything. 

Another thing if concern is she has not processed grieving, with her grandmother passing 5 years ago Indus not notice as much. He mother passed last year and it was hard in all of us kids included. 

To be clear and this is not meant to sound like rant about her help around the house,  these care just the examples I used.  I’m really at a loss at how to help how and how much to nurture her.  

Do I just give it to her straight no matter how it makes her feel?

By sugarcoating things am I making it worse?  

Does she need recognition for doing things that I see as second nature and just normal things I do as needed?  


Any spouses out there that have had a similar experience? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  
I’m at a loss here any insight is greatly appreciated."

Anxiety,Burning tongue / Numb Tongue and Anxiety ?," Hi everyone; one month ago the tip of my tongue started to burn from nowhere; then it wause numb and then it's burning again. My taste is altered and at the same time I developped loss of smell and a change in my  tinnitus. ( I'm 200% negative to covid ( No antibodies and 3 others negative tests).

Before this incident I started to experience brain fog and feeling weird, with painless pressure on forehead... I did a CT scan in august and it was clear.

My doctor thinks it's just a somatic disorder/ anxiety ; If anyone is having burning tongue with anxiety that's always here 24/24, what do you do for supporting this nightmare, I am the only one with this ?"
Anxiety,Should I feel guilty for avoiding this guy?,"My neighbor likes to come over and smoke with me, he’ll buy from me and honestly tries to guilt me into giving him more than the price but fuck him, don’t care if you’re a friend or not it’s 10 a g from me. 

His house window is on my way out so I have to hold my breath he doesn’t see me going for a walk or coming home from a walk. He’s not a bad guy it’s just that I’m an introvert and so I’m very picky with who I bond with.

Can I just be like “yo I’m an introvert I want to be alone”"
Anxiety,Panic Attacks While Having a Zoom Class,"The last few days of my life have just been fulfilled with anxiety, panic attacks and basically sadness with no reason.

This semester Im working at home again (even though last semester I had presencial classes), we have been quarentining since the 9th of january (so for 2 months), I had my birthday basically alone and Im pretty sure my friends only talk to me to ask me school stuff (the answers, the classes they missed...).

Right now, Im pretty sure I just had a panick attack during an online class. Im shaking, Im crying, Im not hearing a word the teachers are saying, I wasnt able to study/write/think all day, Im in my head and it sucks.

I just want to have a normal college experience, with new friends, relationships, parties, happiness... And yes, Im aware COVID is destroying lives and I shouldnt be complaining, but I dont know how to stop these panic/anxiety attacks (I dont even know how to distinguish them) and Im hating it so much.

I was so much better the last few months and now Im like this again and I hate this cicle of mental shit."
Anxiety,Should I continue with Therapy even if I feel better?,"Hi everyone,

So, some back story - I have diagnosed GAD, for the last 20 years of my life I've had underlying anxiety, and every year or so I'll have some sort of breakdown. Last November through to this January I had a pretty severe anxiety/depression episode which led me to paying for 6 sessions of private therapy while on a waiting list for NHS talking therapies. 

After finishing my paid therapy and making some changes in my personal life, I actually did a full 180. My mood since the end of January has been positive, I haven't had any depressive thoughts and barely any anxious episodes, which for me is all very new and great, I feel like a weight has been lifted. 

However, I've now come to the front of the NHS therapy waiting list. My first session of 6 is tomorrow. I'm wondering whether going ahead with the sessions is the best idea since I'm concerned about re-living my break down with this new therapist, going back into my childhood traumas and generally re-opening old wounds. 

I'm also concerned if I cancel these appointments, if I have any future need for NHS therapy I will be denied a place on the list for turning down the help now. 

So essentially, should I cancel the sessions or shall I go ahead and do them feeling like I don't have anything to talk about?"
Anxiety,Gut issues,"I get really bad gut issues whenever my anxiety strikes.My stomach continuously goes into that ‘butterflies in mystomach’ feeling,it doesn’t sound too bad but it leads to acidity and cramps ,it’s awful.
Also,I get really Nervous sometimes,eventhough mentally I’m not really nervous my stomach starts feeling weird again,I can’t explain it too well but..I start sweating profusely and everything starts shaking..Any advice on how to deal with this better?"
Anxiety,Questions for people who used to masturbate to decrease their anxiety in the morning but found an alternative,"&amp;#x200B;

It sort of works and pacifies me. But its not sustainable, it often makes me more tired throughout the day if I do this. But it is sort of hard to get out of bed with a ton of anxiety about the future and a fear of the stresses and uncertainties of life 

I found that setting the hvac unit to set the temperature to be 83 in the morning so its pleasant to get out of bed, but am not sure what else I should try 

1. What did you find most helpful for anxiety in the morning excluding jerking off? 
2. What did you think would be helpful but was actually very helpful in practice?"
Anxiety,Are you afraid of death?,That's the only question I've got for you.
Anxiety,"I’m wasting my life and I don’t know how to stop, I don’t know if I can","Normally I can just go through my day and not think about this type of stuff but lately I can’t seem stop.

I was listening to a podcast then the topic of college came up, and the two hosts (who are nice and genuine guys) reminisced about their awesome college life with friends, parties, and girlfriends. And the whole time I was thinking about how I haven’t even made a single friend in my first two years of college. I haven’t been to a single party. And I’ve been completely miserable this whole because of my workload.

I don’t even enjoy playing multiplayer video games anymore because I can’t stop thinking about how I’ve always played them by myself while my brother has a group of friends he’s played with for years. 

It’s just so depressing to think about my life. About all the things I never experienced and probably never will. 

My life is a waste."
Anxiety,Got Anxiety Medication Finally but Now Have Anxiety About the Medication,"I got anxiety medication because I am a pretty bad hypochondriac which makes up a huge chunk of my anxiety. I was meant to start a week ago but one of my anxiety sources is mixing medications that are completely safe to mix. I already take meds for my ADD so the thought of mixing these medications is terrifying to me. Now I am up at 3am having another hypochondriac spell because I bumped my head and I am just desperate for a way out this mess.

I hope there are some hypochondriacs out there who can understand me."
Anxiety,"My anxiety has suddenly started to express itself physically, what a horrible rollercoaster that is!","I'm used to anxiety attacks, feeling on the edge of tears, that doomy feeling where you just think/know something awful is happening. My anxiety is usually expressed as this oppressive emotional cloud that just makes me depressed and jumpy, always worried things are going to go wrong.

I'm not saying I was coping well before but it was manageable, you know? Now though. God. I've lurked here so I'd read about visual changes but actually experiencing it sent me into my first true panic attack in months. How scary is it to not be able to see normally/correctly? And why isn't this more talked about by doctors? All of the medical professionals I've talked to over the years and no one has mentioned this to me.

I don't know what happened, one minute I felt crappy but coping and the next I could feel the vice grip of a panic attack and it was as if I as seeing floating dust particles everywhere and then even weirder, I got these splotches of a sort of fogginess like I was trying to see through dirty glass? And dark splotches too. The thought even crossed my mind that I was stroking out or about to discover I had epilepsy because this was such a sudden and out of the blue experience that my I didn't even think it was anxiety. 

I call for an emergency eye examination, they're healthy! I talk to a doctor, ""oh you're just stressed"". Thanks doc, but why didn't you ever tell me this could happen!

Do I laugh or cry about the fact that my anxiety finding a new way to express itself has guaranteed me to feel more anxious thus meaning I experience these symptoms more often? God help me."
Anxiety,How can coworkers support me with my anxiety being at its peak right now?,"How can I have my coworkers help me with severe anxiety? I often forget where I’m at, what I’m doing, and what I’m supposed to be doing. I can’t hear anything that anyone is saying, I lost 20 pounds from working there."
Anxiety,finally getting therapy.. yet i feel upset,"ive been dealing with anxiety for a long time now, and since i’m a minor i was always too scared to ask my parents for therapy, or even tell them what’s going on with me. but just a couple minutes ago i finally admitted what i’m struggling with and that i would like to see a therapist. which is great… however, now i feel like i’m a liar. i feel like there’s nothing wrong with me, and ive dramatized everything in my life to seem like there’s something wrong with me. but in reality, there isn’t. this hurts me because i know i go through a lot with anxiety, ocd, etc. yet i feel like i’m just a normal person who is dramatic, and is getting counseling for no damn reason. like the psychologist is going to ask me questions, and it’s gonna turn out that i don’t have any disorder, and all of this was for no reason. and it’s making me so scared. 

does anyone have any advice on this.. or even just anything to say..?"

Anxiety,International Woman's Day - Boss letting me leave office early.,"I am the only woman out of a 11 person office. It is international woman's day and my boss just said I can leave a hour early. I was excited till I thought about it... what if he is letting me go early because I am annoying, or he has a interview for someone for my position. What if he isn't being nice but just annoyed and wants me gone...

Anxiety,Has anyone tried Kalms Day ?,"So I went to the pharmacy the other day and asked if they have anything for stress/anxiety/panic attacks. As expected they didn’t have much without a prescription but the pharmacist recommended Kalms Day which is a plant based remedy made from valerian root extract. I’ve never heard of it before but I decided to buy it. Before I take it tho, I wanted to know if anyone’s tried it and if it’s worked or not ? Side effects ? Anything ? I could barely find any reviews on it :/"
Anxiety,So done with this shit,"Ive had anxiety on and off for the past few months and it had been a couple of years since I had felt this way but its come back as of late and it’s driving me crazy. I can’t wake up or get good sleep without getting that overwhelming feeling in my chest and I tear up too much of the day. It’s affecting my relationship really bad and makes it feel awful and like stuffs gonna go wrong but I know its all in my head because I’ve felt this way before and it went away but then i dont know because what if somethings actually wrong with it or gonna go bad. I really hate this shit and im so done with it. Im fed up i just wanna feel normal, i cant bring myself to do any school work or to get up from bed im just stuck. Shit fucking sucks and its horrible"
Anxiety,Hypochondriac having a full blown panic attack,"I feel like I’m dying. I’m having pain in my kidney area and my doctor prescribed some low level opioid. I’m not used to the effects, so I felt the drowsiness and shortness of breath as soon as I took it. I called several pharmacists and they told me everything is fine and what I’m describing is normal. Fuck my life... why the fuck did I take those pill!!!! My heart is racing and I’m having shortness of breath. This drowsiness is making me feel like I’m about to collapse and not wake up. Help."
Anxiety,Ativan for a flight or other flying tips?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been suffering from anxiety from years now and take 75mg of Zoloft daily while helps immensely. I am however terrified of flying and always end up having a horrible panic attack the entire time and sobbing my eyes out from the moment I get on the plane until I step off. It’s not a fear of heights, mostly just being trapped and not being able to get off. I’m flying by myself for the first time next month and I’m terrified to not have someone there to help me through my panic attack. My doctor offered me 2 Ativans, one for the flight there and one for the flight back but I’m also terrified of taking new medication and I’m scared I’m going to feel loopy and then freak out about that and it’ll just fuel a panic attack. Does anyone have any experience like this who can help me out? And if they don’t recommend the Ativan what are other useful tips for flying? Thanks!!"
Anxiety,Question,"Had anybody ever had weird tension headaches, body jerks, problems with short term memory, body shakes. Feel like head and neck would tense up/tingling in head. I’m so scared it’s a brain tumor, I went to urgent care twice and they said it’s just anxiety. Went to the hospital and they checked my blood and said it’s just anxiety.

Anxiety,Advice on How to Deal with Anticipating Incoming Bad News?,"I have a phone call coming later this evening with bad news (the caller didn’t specify but let me know to ‘prepare myself’ and ‘don’t take the news too hard’) and since it’s over a phone call rather than email or text like usual, I’m anticipating that it’s something *pretty bad. 
I’ve been pretty sweaty and haven’t been able to breathe quite right the past few hours. Heart is beating pretty fast, of course. 
Does anyone have advice or personal experience on how to calm yourself when you’re anticipating possibly life-changing news? I’ve tried some breathing exercises and meditation but I’m just too distracted to focus on them. 
Maybe show or YouTube recommendations you like that distract you from an upcoming event for a while? Favorite teas or easy recipes? How to accept bad news?
Thank you for any help 🙏"
Anxiety,Shitty Corporate World,"How is it that the corporate world treats the employees as slaves, literally owns their happiness, forces anxiety and depression via long working hours, dirty politics, and unimaginably senseless deadlines and still organises lectures on mental health? The audacity!"
Anxiety,Weird when Heart Rate is Normal,"Any long term anxiety sufferers feel weird when you have a day where your heart isn’t racing? My heart rate when sitting during the day is usually in the 80s and walking around low 100s but today my heart rate has been in the low 60s while sitting and mid 80s walking around. Kind if freaked me out not feeling my heart thudding in my chest and I felt almost too calm which in turn caused a little anxiety and worry in me. 

Anyone else get worried like this when you have a random day where you feel normal? Almost like its too good to be true and now I think there is something wrong that is causing my heart rate to be normal instead of accepting that maybe the daily meditation and getting a good night sleep is why and their is nothing wrong with you. Super frustrating."
Anxiety,Anyone with anxiety get a headache and feel like they can't focus or concentrate,"Anyone with anxiety feel like if they try to focus on basic everything chores and try to read, watch tv etc, feel fainted and spaced  when trying to concentrate , I tried watching tv and read felt like I will faint and pass out and start to panic  with a pain in my head.I had a ct scan non contrast recently and it was normal"
Anxiety,I've been feeling it for a while until now.,"I'm outside a king diver inside the car waiting for my mother to come. Hsy a couple eating inside, I took a selfie and I feel like they thought I took them. Omg gradually in these 5 minutes I feel as if everyone inside is watching me. A moment ago I had the feeling that the car was moving. I'm tired of having these situations because I know it's not real. :((("
Anxiety,My feel my anxiety kicks in while waking up from sleep.,"Even if I feel normal during the daytime, I feel that I wake up with anxiety. When I wake up, it feels like my mind suddenly started to run. If I were to describe the feeling, it's like a wheel that is revolving really fast with huge momentum but without control. It feels really overwhelming.

 Sometimes I can consciously understand that the moment before waking up when I'm at light sleep, my mind is calmer. But right as I wake up things feel messy."

Anxiety,Climate anxiety,"I try to avoid reading articles about it nowadays, it makes me too anxious and unable to sleep or think. There's no future, only doom and gloom, resource wars etc... What a horrible world we live in, why wasn't i born in the 50's? Sure the looming nuclear war like our parents experienced is about as horrible but in hindsight it never happened. 

I try to do my best not using a lot of water, eating vegetarian and using only my bicycle but at the end of the day we're fucked anyway."

Anxiety,Freaking out that my fiancé will die,"My fiancé is a pilot for the military and I can’t stop freaking out that he is going to die. It doesn’t help when people make jokes about making sure he has good life insurance.

I am constantly freaking out every time he goes on a training flight.

I also get super anxious knowing he is driving a long distance. 

In addition he also loves motorcycles and loves to ride them above the speed limit. 

He is actually a very smart person and I’ve ridden with him in the car and on his bike so I know he is safe. I know from others that he is good at his job but i can’t help it. What if in 5 years we have small kids and he dies? 

I cut back on coffee and alcohol because I thought this was making my anxiety worse but I still can’t stop these horrible intrusive thoughts. I made the mistake of checking pilot fatality statistics and it said 30% for a pilot with a 20 year career. 30%!!!!!!!! I am trying so hard not to absolutely start bawling at work today."
Anxiety,this is killing me. I cannot handle it anymore. I'm tired. I'm so fuckin tired.,
Anxiety,Feeling really overwhelmed and could really use some support :(,"I’m feeling so lost and anxious right now. Everything is overwhelming. My laundry needs to be done, but there’s so much and it’s too overwhelming to do. My room and bathroom need cleaning, but it’s too overwhelming. I haven’t met my hours at work in weeks. I’m worried about money and getting fired. I’m late on deadline for a project and can’t sit down and focus on it. My dog has been sick and i’m too anxious to call the vet. Most of all, I’m seeing someone new and I’m terrified to tell him about my type 1 herpes. my confidence is so low. i’m not sure what to do, i feel like the walls are closing in on me and i just want to disappear."
Anxiety,venting i guess,"Ive been dealing with anxiety for a while now ever since I was a little kid, I had bad ocd and was often anxious about religion/ my family. Now I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I'm slowly watching myself lose more and more will to live. I get thoughts that I'm too much and that my family would be better off without me. I know those things aren't true, I'm well aware that i shouldn't be feeling these things and every time that awareness makes me feel worst. I always try to be good to myself, and I've never hurt myself apart from slapping or punching myself. I always want to try my best everyday but it always feels like its never enough. Typing this out and letting it out is so hard, i can feel all the pressure building up to my head and in my chest. I meditate as much as i can, some days all i can get away with is taking deep breaths for a few moments. I don't even know what i want from this post.  I'm supposed to be looking for a therapists but I'm so afraid that its not going to work because I've tried so many things. The one time i went on meds it made me feel so much worst. Meditation is really hard to do somedays. I get these things where i just cant think straight an di just feel like im floating in my brain, i feel like i cant move during these things and my body tenses up. I dont really know why this happens, i used to just have panic attacks and with those atleast people can see im in distress but with this im just scrunched up and its so terrifying. I tell myself to take things day by day and that everyday is a new day but its getting so hard."
Anxiety,Day 16 of Prozac (2 weeks) How did you feel?,I have been on 10mg for about 2 weeks and at first it was kind of causing me intense brain fog and confusion. I’m starting to feel the effects of the medication now tho I think my anxiety has relaxed a lot! But I’m sleeping a lot more now and feeling a lot of pressure in my head. Just wondering if anyone felt anything like this or what ur experience was 2 weeks in to Prozac? Or any SSRI? thanks boysss and girls
Anxiety,I feel like I completely forget the feeling of anxiety when I'm good without anxiety in the moment.,"Like the title says, I forget the feeling of how horrible it feels to feel anxiety in the moment, or panic attacks or regarding anything when I'm good without anxiety for few days or weeks. I don't like that. I mean, I'm supposed to be happy about it but I cant.

Because I know.. it eventually comes back, and when I feel the anxiety after good ol' days, it feels extremely horrible as if I'm suffering from it for the first time ever. I forget how to get in control of my anxiety. I let it take over me and I have to start back from bottom to get a grip of myself. Jesus, what the hell is wrong with me?!"
Anxiety,Help how do I rewire my anxious brain and thoughts,"Had anxiety for two years now after weed withdrawal.  Don't feel much of a panic or anxious except for times but have this constant thinking pattern and thoughts process that i think has just been fixed into my brain after getting anxiety.

Well things are all over the place but please do read it.

Hello, i cant concentrate i keep staring at things i feel like I've recently developed astigmatism , or just vision disturbance , the worst part for me is i keep making scenarios up in my head and get stuck up in it , even when I'm around people , so i'm not really conscious around what's happening around me,  i am conscious but i feel like more on autopilot than anything else, and there are times when i am aware and times when i feel like i'm just stuck day dreaming  even when someone is infront of me trying to communicate with me ,  and i'm  making up a scenario talking to this person right  infront of me like ""he'd say this, i'd say this, and more"" i do reply to their conversations but when they're talking to me i just feel like I'm zoning out and my mind is just day dreaming about the conversation itself or something completely random. Zoning out and thinking of something random is disturbing but i feel like its common, but whats more disturbing and difficult for me to understand is sometimes i am sleeping with my girlfriend , my eyes are closed and I'm thinking of her in a scenario for few minutes and i'm drifting into it and when i open my eyes and see her right infront of me i get sooo confused, like she's the person I'm thinking about but she feels so diff, like a diff person or sth, its hard to explain, basically when i open my eyes ik its her but it feels like i was thinking of someone else. Its really disturbing and happens often  what is this?  and kinda builds up a fear . Especially when I'm sleeping I think of something and when i open my eyes i feel like where am i. What's going around , that kinda fears me into thinking if I'm going mad or developing schizo , because of the fear sometimes after a long day with someone while sleeping and drifting into sleep  hear random words inside my head  from the people i have spent the day with kinda like a recall of things but i feel like if its schizo but i had these two years ago and i still do sometimes after a long day and I usually have this when I'm drifting off to sleep especially when drunk. So I thought its pretty common but idk. Also the constant overthinking and always thinking about something a scenario or something else This makes me feel like I'm living my day on an autopilot just getting through everything properly but not being really conscious or aware. I do get feelings of depersonalisation or disassociation from time to time and I've learned a little bit about how to handle it but please any tips more would be welcomed

My main problems rn are

Constant tired / fatigued / sleepy. Tips for it? Must be from all the overthinking 

I feel like something i did just recently feels like a distant past. Like if i spent an hour in a restaurant with someone and after we're done and get in the car i feel like even tho it happened just a minute ago, it feels like few hours ago and yesterday feels like a long time ago. Like the continuous feeling isn't there or sth. What is this? How do i combat this, anyone else had this feeling?

Vision disturbances like astigmatism or bright lights kinda disturb me and even sounds like sometimes even low volumes seems too loud for me , but i go clubbing and that sound doesn't disturb me but again  i sometimes feel echo in a big space where people don't usually notice it until i make people aware about it and they'll be like yes or maybe or little bit. Its really disturbing the light and sounds. Sometimes i see weird patterns after just seeing a bright light or torch its really disturbing, sometimes even on my phone screen, 

Depersonalisation and disassociation like when i look into the mirror i feel so weird at times  like i have been thinking of me in fake scenario in my head and when i look into the mirror it just feels so weird

I keep making up scenarios in my head, like i'll have scenarios with my friends talking to me back and forth. Like i'll say this and he'll say this . Or i'll just picture myself doing something and get really excited about it like accomplishing something or being successful its good in a way but it really just keeps continuing and i cant stop. And sometimes when I'm around people and i am making scenarios talking to myself and fake situations, sometimes i feel like I'm thinking about it and nodding or smiling or doing something and when someone sees me its super embarrassing and disturbingly weird . Its really disturbing. But sometimes i cant stop it . What should i do? 

Help guys. I really need help with re wiring my thought process. I can stay calm and not panic at times. But the thought process and everything just makes me feel like i'm living on autopilot or its just really disturbing and hampering i went to a therpaist once and she did nothing but tried to scare me more. She gave me a very generic advices didn't tell me any combat or tips I couldn't even explain her everything properly. She was really bad even my friends who have went to her tells

Anxiety,Anyone else get ridiculously sad after feeling even a tiny amount of anxiety?,"(F25) I'm pretty positive and optimistic most the time, and when I go out I know there's likely to be anxiety but everytime I get even that slight feeling of panic and wanting to run away, my instant response is.. Despair?!

I usually control my anxiety these days and don't panic although it can make me very uncomfortable for a while. Even feeling it for 2 minutes feels like a lifetime, I hope you all agree. Feeling it just makes me instantly sad, like I remember how truly evil things can still get you even when you're OK and having fun even. It's like realising I might have to leave or have a panic attack even, despite just having fun or relaxing etc.

I had a picnic today and it was wonder, but I felt a little full which triggered the anxiety and it was like suddenly everything was meaningless and horrifying because it all just led to this. It hasn't ruined my day, but I'm so annoyed it happened even tho I stayed calm and I'm pretty sure the person I was with didn't even notice. Just... Awful"
Anxiety,"Do I have subconscious anxiety? For years, can't find cause for physical symptoms","Hello all,

I have a case that has puzzled doctors all over my city. My symptoms: A few years ago, and every 4-6 months, I experience a health event.

During this event - sometimes in afternoon, sometimes in the middle of the night - I feel extremely poor (generally unwell). Everything goes white. I want to pass out, my limbs feel strange and weightless. There is a pressure in my chest and my heartbeat raises, i sometimes get cold sweat. 

These severe symptoms subside after 20-30 minutes. Following that, I get nausea for like a week+.

I've ran through many tests - my blood is clean, my blood pressure is perfect, etc etc etc. My heart sounds OK. I've had chest and stomach MRI's. I do not take and have never taken any pills (not even advil etc).

So, one of my docs suggested that I investigate the mental angle. I went to 10 sessions with a therapist, and we both agree that I do not fit the bill. I have no issues with bad thoughts of any kind, I do not live a stressful life, and everyone is safe and healthy and financially secure. I sleep like a baby. Anytime these ""events"" happen, I am not in any sort of stressful week or situation (most times its middle of the night!)

So, is there such a thing as subconscious anxiety? I am stressed without realizing it and having no thoughts of it? How would I even get that diagnosis confirmed? MRI brain scans? haha

thanks,"
Anxiety,Not a minute of relief from anxiety over past 4 weeks,"28M here.

In 2018 I was diagnosed with  anxiety depressive disorder, was on meds for  some time (Sertagen) until it eventually got better. Then I stopped  taking the pills, started running and living more healthy, my life  improved a lot overall. I am saying this just to let you know I have a  record of mental health issues.

Anxiety  or depression episodes still used to happen from time to time but it  didn't impact my life significantly. I have quite a stressful job on top  of that, but the money is good.

Well, I had.

Until  4 weeks ago after a very rough confrontation with my boss who is an  absolute worst person in the world, I swear. He basically was even a  worse a-hole for the past few months, throwing tantrums for no reason  and stuff. There came one month that I did not meet the sales  expectations, but only for a slight, and most people in the company  failed doing so (January was kinda bad month for our business). He went  absolute mad about it and basically said that he's going to reduce my  salary and that's by 20 f-ing percent.

I  said that it's kind of a big deal for me and I understand that the  month was bad, and that I will improve and I will meet sales  expectations for the rest of the year. He said that either I take the  salary reduction, or I am leaving, with a 3-months termination of a  contract. I was like woah, but I said yeah okay, then you left me with  no choice. I wanted to spit in that man's face. I think that I never  experienced genuine, sincere hatred towards someone, until now.

After  5 years of hard work and gaining a few big clients for the company,  they basically threw me away like a garbage (well I had a choice but  honestly - how could I accept this?). I feel worthless.

So  I still have to work until the end of April, and then I get my days off  which I didn't use, so I will also receive the salary for May but I  won't have to work.

It was on  Friday 12th February. 6 days later, on Thursday 16th, my girlfriend  broke up with me saying that I became distant, because for a few days I  didn't speak to her much. I obviously didn't receive any encouragement  from her, or any support whatsoever. Well, after all, I am the MAN and  MEN get S done and they don't complain, right?

My  life has become an absolute living nightmare. Over the past 4 weeks I  barely did anything in order to get a new job. I prepared a CV but I am  too anxious to send it anywhere. There was not a single minute in which I  did not think about what happened to me, about the injustice I  experienced and about the necessity of finding a new job. I think about  it when I wake up, when I brush my teeth, when I have my breakfast, when  I leave my apartment, when I work, when I come back, when I go running,  when I take a shower, when I read, when I play, when I watch Netflix,  when I study German, I did not stop thinking about this for a single  minute. Somatic symptoms start to raise up, I have troubles sleeping,  eating and I feel like I started compulsively scratching my skin on arms  and biting my lips.

I would just  love to have a 5 minute relief from the panic, but I also know that I  need to start looking for a job. And it makes me panic. What if I don't  get any replies? What if I fail on the interview? What, just what will  happen to me?! I just have no idea what I should do. I don't have anyone  to speak about it.

That's a long  rant and sorry for that. I never thought I was gonna suffer so much from  losing my job. I just feel kind of hopeless, like the fear is going to  stay with me forever."
Anxiety,I haven’t had a birthday where I didn’t cry,"Today’s my birthday, and right on schedule I’m balling my eyes out about seemingly nothing. On my birthday I always cry no matter how good or bad everything goes. It’s like all the excitement the expectation that everything will go well is too much I just have to snap and then subsequently cry. It’s one of the reasons I set my expectations low. If I set my expectations low enough I’ll never be sad that it didn’t work out. It I say to myself I’m gonna cry then it doesn’t feel so bad when I do. I know this is a damaging mindset but it’s one of the things I do to feel safe. Now everything that’s supposed to remind me to be happy makes me sad. All the stuff people do reminds me of how much I failed. Birthday balloons make me cry because it makes me remember that this day was supposed to be good or that’s I’m supposed to be happy. Then everyone asks me why I’m upset and there’s no way to explain other than ineligible slobbering in between the bouts of me balling. They remind me that it isn’t fair to everyone and that I’m gonna disappoint people, they try to make it a motivate me. But i already beat myself up enough not have someone else reminding me to. Now they are gonna think it’s their fault that I feel this way but really it’s me which makes me feel a million times worse. How do I get over disappointing everyone and always ruining everything?"

Anxiety,my anxiety is slowly killing me,
Anxiety,Has lockdown turned anyone else's home into a strange trigger?,"I know it sounds bizarre!  But my worst symptoms now always happen at home and at night, especially bouts of Depersonalization-Derealization. This is the exact opposite of how my anxiety presented pre pandemic where I would get anxiety attacks before interviews and meetings.

I feel much better getting out for a walk, even in the rain. Even my visits to various specialists and counsellors haven't given me half the anxiety that just sitting at home seems to these days. I find myself dreading sunset and counting the hours until sunrise. I can't stay calm or grounded at home.

I can't work out what it is. Too much of the same scenery? The isolation? A random development of seasonal affective disorder? Whatever it is, this is the strangest curveball my brain has thrown at me yet. I'm itching to be able to go and sit in coffee shops and take exercise classes again."
Anxiety,Not sure what to do??,"Okay so basically, I haven’t had a doctor since I turned 18 years old - I just never had the balls and assumed if anything ever went wrong I would get over my anxiety and just call a damn doctor. Well, I was wrong. I’m 22 and I’ve been sick for about 2 years now, and have lost almost 100 pounds due to this unknown issue and I am very uncomfortable in my own body but still can’t. seem. to. call. a. damn. doctor. 
It’s gotten ridiculous and I’m getting very upset with myself, so I figured I’d see if I could get any advice here.
I have a doctor lined up and everything, all I have to do is call the place and tell them I’m a new patient and I need to set up an appointment with one of their doctors. But I can’t seem to do that for some reason. Any tips on personal motivation? Or how to call for a new doctor? Keep in mind I’ve never called this place once, I’ll be a completely new patient to this doctor."
Anxiety,Can I die from a bad enough panic attack?," 

Hey everyone. I am a 27 year old male. 5'5 and 140 lbs. I take Xanax as needed, I quit smoking 4 years ago, and I have no current medical issues aside from the psychological ones that cause debilitating symptoms that I will explain. 

Panic attacks and fear of my heart is ruining my life to the point where I am CONVINCED they will kill me in certain situations (such as a plane). Therefore, I'm missing out on vacations and feeling completely ashamed about that. I have a trip planned in June and I don't know if I can go through with it. I am literally convinced I will die from panic.

No doctor has been able to explain to me why a panic attack can't help me.

In 2017 I developed panic disorder and this soon lead me to be terrified of my heart because the attacks make me feel like my heart was going to explode. This fear has not subsided at all. It is ruining my life and doctors and cardiologists I’ve seen just brush me off and tell me I don’t need to worry without explaining to me why.

In 2017 I had a full heart exam. Echo, ecg, and 48 hour holter moniter and the cardiologist told me everything is normal. The fear of the panic has not subsided though.

If you have time, I would really appreciate asking you some questions related to some deep fears I’ve developed around my heart including not being able to go on a plane because the panic will send me into cardiac arrest. I am convinced of this and the shame is eating away at me because I want to travel with my fiancé in June but am convinced I will die if I get on the plane. 

Lastly, I figured I should mention that I do have a script for Xanax but even when I take 1mg I can still be in a state of panic so I feel skeptical that any benzo will help enough to sedate me for the trip.

Warm regards,

Mikayla Fjeld"
Anxiety,I can't keep living like this,"Every time I think I've conquered my anxiety, I get anxiety about something new. First I had anxiety about intrusive thoughts. Then I had anxiety about losing control. Now I'm having anxiety that I could be narcissistic without knowing it. I asked my mom about it and she said that because of my depression, I used to be unable to see another person's point of view in an argument. I feel like when she added that it was because of my depression, she was just trying to make me feel better. I'm so scared that I could be a narcissist. Sometimes I have trouble seeing another's point of view and sometimes I feel like I'm better than other people. Please help me, I don't know what to do about this. Is this normal?"

Anxiety,Massive freak out over health and supplements i've been taking :(,"Hi all. I've been taking zinc supplements on and off for a few years, currently the dose is 15mg most days. My skin hair and nails are great and i often get compliments. Anyway, i've been feeling dizzy for a while and today had pressure in the top of my head (its still there.). Somehow my brain has linked this to zinc? I researched and realised women only need about 8mg a day, I take 15mg! Also I will get extra zinc from foods. Apparently 40/45mg is the limit an adult should take of zinc a day. I dont think ive been hitting the limit... but still im hugely freaking out that i have caused myself long term damage from taking zinc everyday! Ive convinced myself I might either go blind, destroy my brain or get really ill somehow. I have also associated this with my weird head pressure and dizzieness... whats going on? Im super scared:( i took supplements to avoid bad health originally,  never thought about it being too much of a good thing! I feel so stupid :("
Anxiety,I don't know what to do.,"Hi. This is my first post and english is not my first language so please be kind.

So... I (F20) might have anxiety but I don't know. The thing is that I've been feeling this way for as long as I can remember but everyone always brushed it off saying that I'm just shy. But deep down I always knew that it wasn't just that.

Lately, with Univerity's work and exams it got really bad. In a month I'll have my first oral exam and I'm already starting to feel sick. It's gotten to the point where I'm thinking about dropping out (I don't want to but it's a constant  thought). And thinking that a few days before the exam I'll be even more of a mess makes me feel even worse. I just can't deal with that, I'm having trouble sleeping and I don't know what to do.

I want to go see a doctor because I can't do this anymore, but the problem is that I'm still economically dependent on my parents and they don't understand it at all! Where I live, mental health is still pretty much a taboo (especially in small towns) and no matter what I do I can't get them to help me or even understand my point of view. I tried many times in past years to talk with my mother about it but she always brushed it off with a joke untill I broke down crying one night because I couldn't take it anymore for many reasons. After that night she took me to a herbalist shop (idk if the term is correct but it's the shop with all the natural remedies) because, and I quote, ""all the psychologists are more troubled than the patients"". So... nothing changed. I completely gave up until a year a go when I went to a chiropractor for my neck and back pains and he told me (without even me telling him anything) that I absolutely had to do something for my anxiety. I told my mom and she told me that we will figure it out. But it's been a year and again nothing changed. 

I feel hopeless. I considered doing it alone but public health care takes a lot of time (especially with covid), and I don't have the money to book an appointment with a doctor. And on top of that I'm not even sure how it works (I'm 20 but I don't feel like an adult, honestly).

I don't really know the point of this... I just wanted to get it off my chest I guess, since it's just me, myself and I (my friends know I'm very anxious but I've never told them the complete situation because I don't have a diagnosis and I always live in fear of having imagined everything).

I don't know... If anyone has a few tips on how to handle the situation, or just anything."
Anxiety,People do things like they're so easy to do.,"I've been going for therapy for quite sometime now and I really thought I was ready for the stress and for the ""real world"" but I'm not. Doing my masters is proving to be extremely hard for me. When I talk to other people they make it sound so easy- like it's just a couple of chapters. It's just a quiz..... No it's not. It's life or death. I either learn it in one go or I don't. It's got the potential of changing my life for better or worse. It's important, it's gonna help me someday in the real world and it's too big a responsibility to just read it. How do people just sit and do stuff. Like don't you need to set the room right, have all your material around you and minimise distraction. Create the perfect plan and then execute it. Couldn't any moment in our lives be the one that defines us for the rest of it, don't we need to walk on egg shells or something? How do people pretend like things are easy and just go around acting on thoughts and getting work done. 

I'm so tired of being the odd one. The one who thinks herself into overthinking and gets nothing done. I'm tired of being pulled back from leading the so called normal life. I want to be like others. I don't want to spend my day in bed due to an emotion. I don't want this emotion to determine the kind of life I deserve to live. I want to break free from these chains and for once be able to study without feeling like the world rests on my shoulders.


Thank you for listening."

Anxiety,How to overcome anxiety,"The following may sound disturbing, shocking, or like silly new-age bullshit, but for your own sake, please give me some of your trust and try to put my advice into practice to see for yourself whether or not it works: 

From personal experience, I can tell you with absolute certainty and conviction that Awareness is the key to liberation from the suffering of life and to attaining unconditional happiness. Awareness is how I overcame my Depression, anxiety and many other mental illnesses and found immense unconditional joy and satisfaction that cannot be found anywhere else. 

Awareness is extremely simple and straightforward: All you have to do is to observe (and stop identifying with) your sensory perceptions (sights, sounds, smell, taste, touch), bodily sensations and most importantly your mind (thoughts and emotions) in a distanced and detached way, from the present, silent and empty space of Awareness. 

As a beginner, you will want to do this in sitting meditation (start with 5 minutes and work your way up to 30-60+ minutes, if you want to be serious about this you should meditate as much as possible) but eventually you should also remain in this state of Awareness outside of meditation, basically 24/7, whatever situation you are in. 

You will realize that you ARE this Awareness that is observing all phenomena, that all phenomena (including your mind, body and even the whole world/universe) are taking place inside of YOU (the Awareness), not the other way around. You will realize that your mind-made sense of self with which you have identified yourself up to this point has been a lie created by the limited human mind (that is also taking place inside of you and can be observed). You have believed yourself to be the combination of your body and mind and have suffered because of all the lies of your mind that you have believed, without realising that your True Self of empty Awareness was hiding behind all of it and observing everything all this time. All of your suffering comes from this false identification with your finite body and mind. 

Awareness is the unchanging, eternal, infinite, absolute Mind and ground of reality (aka God), inside of which the whole universe and your life takes place. Your life with all its experiences is like a little bubble inside of this infinite field of Awareness. It comes and it goes, but the field in which it arises is eternal. 

Reality is not material, but a shared dream inside of this Mind. Everything arises within this Mind and there is nothing but the different direct experiences. There is no universe outside of your perception of it. You are God himself, temporarily limiting yourself to this little human avatar in order to experience this world with all its pain and joy, and to rediscover your magnificent nature. (Which all will do upon death, but you can do this right here and now) 

Realizing and entering this infinite field of Awareness is what is also known as ""Awakening"" or ""Enlightenment"", and exactly what all the true prophets and saints like Jesus (""The Kingdom of Heaven is within"", ""I am one with the Father"" etc.) and the Buddha (Buddha-Nature, No-Self, Emptiness etc.) have discovered. 

This post pretty much sums it up, but if you want to hear more about it, I suggest you follow some teachers that talk about Awareness on YouTube, like Eckhart Tolle, Rupert Spira and Mooji (there are many more, but these are probably the best). 

Here is a video where Mooji talks about Awareness specifically in relation to Depression: https://youtu.be/BJQvt4AkMB8"
Anxiety,How can I better deal with work anxiety?,"I’m new to the professional world so going from school where I can master things and be good at a class to going to a career in accounting where it’s normal to not know anything when you start, is really draining. I’m constantly anxious about project performance reviews and doing things wrong and I can’t get it through my brain that it’s expected that I know nothing technical my first year. Has anyone gone through this and can give some sort of advice on things you did that helped even a little bit? Especially online, I feel like anytime someone tells me to fix something or that I did x wrong, that they’re mad at me even though I know they’re not. My anxiety is telling me that everyone’s out to get me and it’s draining me and seeping into every aspect of my life right now to the point where I want to quit."
Anxiety,How to do a human interaction?,
Anxiety,Prazepam and alcohol,So i've taken Prazepam like 8 hours ago and don't feel any affects from it anymore but i want to drink tonight but i'm scared i might not even wake up anymore because they say you can't mix those both but because it's been a while is it safe to drink now? Also i am on antidepressants but i heard you can drink on them but it just intensifies the side effects
Anxiety,Always having anxiety attack,"I’m always having anxiety attack every time I thought of leaving my parents. I currently work for them and the job is terrible. 4 days a week working from 8-9 am to 11:30pm-12am. I don’t get paid enough while having 0 benefits. I told my parents that I want to quit but they asked 3 months because finding a replacement isn’t easy for the type of business they have. I told them that I want to do the job that I actually like doing now since my job really gives me bad anxiety. But they keep begging for me to stay at least 2 days a week. But I don’t really want to work there anymore. When I talked to them, They made me feel guilty and called me selfish. I explained to them that I’m having anxiety but my step mom doesn’t believe it. She thinks I got my anxiety from something else although I got it from them. My dad believes me but he’s scared to quit his other job since he works for his sister. I don’t know what to do. My anxiety always attacking me while I’m still at that job. I thought of just doing a no show since I had already given them a notice. But I feel bad for them as well because they will not be able to just leave their business since someone has to be staying there all the time. They told me to stay for my dad because he is my dad. They told me they should be my first priority since we’re family. But they give me bad anxiety. I want to hurt myself every time I get one. I want to bang my head. I want to sometimes just disappear from the world. I just want to be with my girlfriend since she’s the only one that’s with me in hard times"
Anxiety,I stumbled,"I got carpal tunnel on both hands and for a while I was scared

I couldn't move my right hand

It got significantly better after 3 weeks and I removed my splints while working and while playing video games and then that Sunday put a new desk together.

After putting that desk together my index finger on my left hand started shaking. No weakness, no difficulty grabbing things just shaking.

I know thats both an anxiety symptom and a carpal tunnel symptom and I I've looked at it logically. I favored my left hand over my right because my right was worse, I worked and gamed without splints, I even fell asleep without my splints one night.

Everything is pointing to me just agitating my carpal tunnel but I can't seem to stay convinced on that. I keep jumping to the worst outlandish possible reason despite there being a more probable explanation"
Anxiety,Learning to tolerate distress,"I’ve been intrigued and even a bit comforted by the idea of not fighting anxiety so much (not having to get around it, but just get through it.) However, I find tolerating and managing the distress so much harder in practice, and it bothers me what a hit to quality of life it is (when something like a Xanax or Ativan could just wipe it out.) still, I’d like to be less reliant on as needed meds and better at riding the waves of anxiety and powering through. The problem is in practice I’m not great at, especially because my anxiety attacks are not panic attacks but can be more of a mood that lasts days or even weeks. Curious how you may have found ways of just tolerating and accepting anxiety. Did it get easier with practice? Any tips?"
Anxiety,We are having major house issues and I don’t think I’ve stopped shaking in a week,"Female, 25, been on Paxil for 5 years. Have not had a panic attack during that time. I moved home to my mother's house about a year ago bc I was diagnosed with hypersomnia (I need about 18 hours of sleep) and I currently am not working as I try to figure out my medical condition.

Last Monday all of a sudden there were loud noises and I went downstairs and there were cracks in the ceilings and all during that day there were more loud noises and the floors are sagging and the crown molding popped off. My mom works during the day, so she was not there. I googled it and of course it told me I was on a sinkhole and that is when the panic started. I got so scared that I jumped in my car and drove around bc it made me so nervous to be in there. Needless to say we are not on a sinkhole. I have had two people come by so far to give quotes and they both said it is that the floor joist do not have enough support, but that it is safe right now, but the fixes need to be done soon. I am getting 4 more quotes this week. 

The past couple of days I have been panicking that we have a gas leak or carbon monoxide leak bc it seems everything else has gone wrong with this house. I have carbon monoxide alarms and I tested them and they are working with full batteries, so I don't know why I am worried about that. Then as for gas leak I smell nothing. I am just so freaked out about it and I cannot figure out why. The utilities man came by today bc I did think I heard something weird and he tested everything and found no leaks except for the furnace outside was not burning all the gas so he turned off the gas valve to the furnace and said we have to get it fixed before we can turn it on again. So then of course my fear became what if by turning that off he made the gas have too much pressure or something. and he was young (I am young too, so not anything against young people, but I am just so paranoid obviously) Once again there is still no smell. I think I just get so freaked out because a lot of the physical symptoms of these things such as fatigue, headaches, lightheaded etc. are what I already have from my hypersomnia and then trouble breathing is a symptom from having a panic attack which I have had this week. 

My mom is not here during the day. I can't really go anywhere because of the pandemic and because I don't know anybody in this town bc my mom moved here when I was in college and it is not where I grew up, so I am looking for any advice somebody might have of how to calm down while remaining here. 

I know it is not rational and I have not been in a constant fight or flight mode like this ever. I oftentimes think that the house is shaking just to realize that no that is me shaking!"

So that caused me to think that they only did it to be nice and that they don’t like me. And that they care about people who are better and not autistic (like I am) Am I making any sense?

I drove him to the vet where he died. He trusted me and I made the choice to kill him. I keep trying to imagine what he was thinking. I feel like a terrible person. Then I think about my other animals and how they are going to die. Makes me never want to get another animal again.

Anxiety,The irony of posting on here when you have anxiety - you sit there for 20 minutes staring at the screen thinking about it first...I'm just gonna say everything on my mind,"I was diagnosed with anxiety a couple of years ago and I've had my ups and downs, but lately its been feeling a lot worse. I tried putting off taking medication as long as possible and just started a few months ago. During the time the world has been falling apart due to covid, my boyfriend also ended up moving continents so we have been doing very long distance since then. 

I've always liked being around people and would consider myself very social, but since the isolation periods, online school and everyone being busy, I've found myself to be much more nervous before seeing/talking to people that I haven't seen in a while, even if we are good friends. 

Lately its been a gamble each day of whether I'll feel happy and excited or shaky and reclusive. I hate this. Its been day in day out of struggling of coming up with things to do during the day, what I'm going to force myself to eat (after an hour or so of overthinking), my leg constantly shaking, and the guilt that I feel after thinking I wasted my day being nervous when I could have been productive. I don't even know what I'm anxious about half the time, I just feel the feelings, get a headache or feel nauseous, start shaking and being consumed by my racing thoughts.

My desire to do things I would like doing before (singing, reading, walking outside or being active in other ways, spending time with other people) has decreased a lot and I end up spending many days re-watching my favourite shows because it feels like one of the only ways I can relax. When I try to snack or make food during this time I also end up overthinking until my stomach hurts and feel guilty when I finally do decide to eat. Some days these are the most exciting things, watching shows, eating, and talking virtually with my boyfriend.

I spend lots of these days alone in my room, and the person who gives me the most support in the world is 7,500km away from me for the time being. My thoughts have been pretty dark lately and I find my heart racing and breathing becoming shaky when I try to reach out for support whether it be from friends or any other way, so my boyfriend suggested I turn to reddit. After overthinking for a little while I decided to post this...can anyone relate to any of this? Any advice?"
Anxiety,I always feel so stupid when I share what my anxiety makes difficult for me,"My anxiety has made looking for jobs very difficult for me.

I feel like my anxiety makes me sound so incompetent at times..."
Anxiety,Did my GAD return after stopping Zoloft?,"I was on 200mg of Zoloft for 10 years for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. 

Thanksgiving Day, I took my final dose ( after a long taper) of Zoloft. 

I was dizzy for a solid month. But no depression, no anxiety and then after 30 days  completely off Zoloft....BAM out of no where my GAD has come back so strong. 

No panic attacks, but I wake up with anxiety and it’s there almost all day, most days. 

Is my body just adjusting to being off Zoloft or do I need medication treatment with my therapy, meditations, CBT, etc?"
Anxiety,propranolol and alcohol,"i’ve been prescribed propranolol on a take as i need basis, and i’m just wondering if anyone has any experience with using it in that way + drinking alcohol. i understand i shouldn’t drink when i’ve taken a tablet, but is it fine to drink a few days later? thanks in advance !!"
Anxiety,My Battle With Depression,[removed]
Anxiety,Anxiety and panic attacks dormant for years before starting up again?,"I should preface this by saying that when I was in my early teens I was having panic attacks before I went to sleep about the thought of dying. At the time, I didn’t realize what they were. My mom took me to a therapist and I was placed on Fluoxetine and after awhile they seemed to disappear. I would still get hung up on things from time to time, but it wasn’t debilitating like the panic attacks were - it was just a low level anxiety. 

Fast forward 20 years later and I’m now in my early 30’s. Two Friday’s ago I stopped smoking cigarettes cold turkey and all hell broke lose. For four days straight I was riding a constant anxiety with peaks of panic attacks. 

Finally, I went to Urgent Care and they gave me hydroxyzine to calm me down and I saw my primary last week who prescribed Zoloft.

Obviously the Zoloft is going to take a while to kick in, but I am still pretty consistently anxious. It’s not nearly as bad as it was last week, but I’m bummed that I now have to manage this out of nowhere. It’s so hard - and I know you all know this so I don’t even need to elaborate. 

It’s crazy to me that it was lying below the surface for 20 years. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?"
Anxiety,Everyday all day,Hello first post here just had some questions. I don't have a clue if what I'm experiencing is anxiety or actually a health problem. Ive been seem for literally everything that I feel but I just keep getting told I'm fine. I walk around feeling like im going to passout but its 100x worse when im in public. I feel like my brain is only half working I get dizzy my heart will race then feel heavy but if I breath it out long enough it goes away. Everyday I wake up hoping ill feel better but never do its just a constant worry that im dying or that my heart is failing or im going to faint. Life is rough
Anxiety,Tips for coping with anxiety????,"Hiii :))) so I’ve suffered with GAD since I’ve been a young child and I’ve been in and out of therapy all my life. No therapist has actually been able to help me or literally give me any tips for my anxiety. I know other people get work sheets and homework and advice. My therapists always seem to listen to me rant and that’s it. 

I have severe GAD and health anxiety and since my therapists never help I was wondering if anyone had any tips that helped them??? Anything at all that anyone could share would be very helpful! Thank you"

I hope your day was full of peace and you have some comfort. I hope you know that you are loved. One day it will get easier for you. Whether you are on medication, talking to a therapist, or just talking to a loved one. You are doing yourself a favor by talking about it. You have to put your mental health first. A lot of people make fun or just don’t understand mental health and I’m sorry. I wish I had a way to show people what you and I go through on a regular basis. It sucks. Whatever twitch or headache you automatically assume the worse. I don’t want you to have to struggle in silence, when I first started having panic attacks I felt alone, I was denying that it was anxiety because I didn’t think anxiety was an actual thing that could make you feel that way. The only thing more exhausting than having a mental illness is pretending that you don’t. After joining this group and another one I realized a lot of other people have worse than me and I cannot even imagine what it is you are actually going through on a daily basis. You will smile again though. There is hope even if your brain tells you that there isn’t. You don’t have to stay broken. We can reach out with each other and we can do this together. You don’t have to be positive all the time. It’s perfectly okay to feel sad, angry, annoyed, frustrated, scared and anxious. Having feelings doesn’t make you a negative person. It makes you human. We need to make mental health more noticeable. I don’t want to see you or anyone else hurting any longer. I will always mean what I say. I am doing this because I want to make sure you all are okay. I have nothing to gain. I will listen to you, I will support you, I will believe in you and your dreams. You will be okay. I love you friends. I will always love you all. Just be patient, change doesn’t happen over night. Remember stay positive, live life, and stay calm."
Anxiety,Panic attacks now what do I do,I've just permanently ruined my relationship and I'll regret it for the rest of my life
Anxiety,i know why deep breathes dont work for me,"its because mother ordered me to take a deep breath and do something that would make me not be in present time writting this post

i dislike to call it that way but it was years ago when i was not that tall as i am now"
Anxiety,Anxiety making job hunting/current new job unbearable,"I won't give my life story because that'd be a lot of info, if you have any questions feel free to ask though. Long story short I deal with terrible anxiety and have been in three part time jobs so far. 

The first job was something I was great at but my boss micro managed everything which made it unbearable for me. I put in my two weeks a few months later. 

My second job had a flawed system (meaning that out of your own hands you could do bad all day for a score like system and there's nothing you could do to change that), I put in my two weeks after barely two months.

I'm currently in a new job and I genuinely don't know what to do. Everyone's being patient so far. But there's so many things I have to remember. I'm currently a college student and I'm actually doing really well, I'm not incapable of remembering things. But under pressure my mind goes completely blank and it's like I don't know what I'm doing. Again everyone's been really patient so far but I'm so scared that I'll eventually get fired because I can't remember everything. And despite being patient they can see how anxious I am and a specific coworker makes me feel like a weirdo because of my anxiety.

I feel so lost and I don't want to job hunt anymore because I feel so pathetic that I can't get used to anything. I don't understand how I keep failing at jobs but I'm ok in college. If you have any advice how to stop ""blanking out"" while under pressure at a cash register or advice on how to remember a lot of different prices I'd really appreciate it. Or even just general anxiety advice."
Anxiety,Books for those paralyzed with fear,"I used to be very brave growing up and believed the world was my oyster. I have had a lot of things happen in my family, lost close family members, my family went bankrupt and we had to start all over in the last three years. 

I still kept a positive attitude but all those things weighed heavily on me. Last year, I got into a car accident that my friend was driving and after that incident, I haven’t been the same. Seeing eye to eye with death and being lucky enough to live and see another day; you would think I would change but I have only grown to be full of anxiety and not trust anyone. I stopped talking to that friend. I have cut most of my friends. I used to trust anyone and everyone but that incident changed my life. I don’t know who to trust anymore. 

All this has also affected my school work and my personal life and I am paralyzed with fear. 

I have fear of everything. I fear talking to people. I fear going after my goals. I fear doing the work. 
I can’t even apply to internships. It takes me weeks before I apply. Fear and anxiety has affected every part of my life. 

**Are there any books on how to overcome fear after the world has been cruel to me, the ones I loved the most passed away and I  almost died.** 

**I need to move forward in life. I can’t let my anxiety and my fear get to me. **"
Anxiety,Anxiety now affecting my dating life,"Tl;dr: My fear of nausea/getting sick in public places has affected two of my recent dates. Instead of being excited for my next date, I’m feeling pangs of anxiety and nausea. How can I improve my locus of control in this? Any tips are welcome 🙏🏼 

So I developed an irrational fear of throwing up in public when I was about 17. It mostly affected my public speaking, sports games etc. Managed to deal with it by myself and thought it was good as gone for the past year. 
Unfortunately, during a recent date, when things were getting exciting, I got severely anxious to the point of being sick multiple times and not being able to sleep. Never had this during an actual date. Part of the stress comes from it being the first guy I’m dating ever; and the fact that I’ll move out of this town in a month. It feels like it’s my chance of exploring this side of me and therefore ‘shit needs to happen before I leave’. 
So the whole experience of the mentioned date was still good (in fact, great until the anxiety kicked in) and I refused to let this stupid fear refrain me from going back. I did, but was never at ease, couldn’t sleep again and had to listen to calming music for most of the night. 

My situation rn:
- sleep deprived; physically (upset stomach) and mentally (anxious state) tired
- thinking of next date gives me pangs of fear 
- refuse to just give up, I want to go on another date
- but mostly want to enjoy it, not in survival mode. 

Things I’ve tried when panic kicks in:
- deep breathing (but doesn’t provide sustainable relief)
- distractions like a puzzle, phone, music (keeps me in track but can’t focus on a date like that)

I want to improve this long-term, not just with in-the-moment coping techniques. I’d love to change my entire mindset towards this fear; what can I control and what should I let go of? I know I’m making this into more than it is, but rationalizing my way out of the fear has never really helped...

Any tips or support I would be most grateful for. I have dealt with this stuff for a while but still haven’t mastered it completely. For anyone who deals with anxiety, you have all my love and kindness. I wouldn’t wish this to anyone

Peace"
Anxiety,Pain in my veins in my neck/hand?,Idk if it’s my vein or my muscle. I’ve had an ekg and i’m still worried due to my BP being high during my anxiety/panic attacks? What is causing this? Anyone else get this? I feel near the area and just feeling my pulse is just making my anxiety worse.
Anxiety,Sleep problems since I moved into shared flat,[deleted]
Anxiety,Sleep problems since I moved into shared flat,"Hello everyone! I'll (23F) start right away and say that I have trouble sleeping since I moved into a shared flat 6 months ago. There are two other people here, one girl my age and a guy who's 32. I like them both but it was clear from the start that this was just for financial purposes. We talk and greet each other when we are in the kitchen or the hallway but besides that everyone is keeping to themselves.

I noticed that ever since I moved in I am always aware of everything I am doing and afraid to anger one of them. I still feel like I am in their territory eventhough it's as much my flat as there's.
I feel weird leaving things in the kitchen on the counter for more than a few hours, I feel like what I am eating is silently being judged and watched because they can see what's in my part of the fridge.
I feel uncomfortable when I am making noises because they are both so damn quiet. I even set my alarm to be low so that they're not disturbed by it.

And I have trouble sleeping like I said above. I think that this + Covid is just too much for me and my sleeping pattern is non-existent. I didn't sleep from Saturday to Sunday, feel asleep at 9:30 am on Sunday until 14:30, fell asleep again at 8:30pm and woke up at 1am. When I wake up I am instantly alarmed and I just feel on edge all the time. I feel like I am also being judged for my messed up sleeping pattern, as it came up in a few conversations with them before. 

I don't know what to do about this. Moving is impossible due to Covid, me being jobless and I just don't want to move again. I moved so many times in my life, I just want to be in one place for a few years. I don't know how to stop being on edge all the time."
Anxiety,Constant worrying,"I’ve been dealing with this for about 10 years now. I am constantly worrying about something. As soon as something I am currently worried about ends up being fine, my mind finds something new to worry about and it’s almost like I can’t help escape it sometimes. It drives me up the wall when I know it’s things that really aren’t even worth worrying about. Does anyone else deal with this or have any tips to overcome it?"
Anxiety,my relatives who gave my grandma covid (that killed her) are now carelessly sitting w thousands of others in a stadium to watch football,when will they ever care? will they even care when they are the ones fucking dying?? idk. they sat and watched her die for a week. yet now they’re sitting buttcrack to buttcrack to watch a fuckin sport. how can people care so little
Anxiety,does anyone else sometimes feel disconnected from the world,like my surroundings just feel off it’s not really derealization it just feels like i’m so disconnected from everything and it’s like i have no emotions idk how to explain it
Anxiety,Sweet dreams!,"Sweet dreams to you my friend! I hope your day was filled with much success and I hope you know that I am so proud of you! You came such a long way! Your happiness means a lot, so no matter what anyone says just know you are worth so much in this world. Don’t listen to your negative thoughts. I know it’s hard to think positive, I know it’s hard to look at yourself in the mirror. Just know that I love you. You should love yourself as well. Take a second to appreciate yourself. Take a second to to realize how precious your life is. So please stay strong. You are always on my mind and I thank you so much for being an amazing day!"
Anxiety,Feeling very frustrated with my anxiety; it's becoming hard to function day to day,"I've not posted on this sub before, so I hope it's alright for me to get some of my feelings out this way ❤ 

I'm a senior in high school; since September, my school has been conducting our classes online every other day of the week due to the pandemic. Recently, it was decided that for the month of February, our online classes will be every day of the week, and then when March begins, we will return to in-person learning with half the school going on Mondays and Wednesdays and the other on Tuesdays and Thursdays (while the Fridays rotate) to maintain social distancing. 

I'm honestly astounded at how difficult returning to class every day, for the time being, has been for me. It's stirred my anxiety to a level it hasn't been at in years. The way my body reacts to feeling incredibly anxious is by becoming very, very nauseous. Often to the point that I end up vomiting and dry heaving for many hours at a time. Every night before school I take my anxiety medications, but if I can't calm myself down enough to sleep through the night, I end up vomiting them up a couple of hours after I take them; it makes it so I can never be sure if my medication is doing its job. 

I'm kicking myself for becoming so comfortable with my previous schedule; at this point, I haven't been to school in-person in nearly a year. I've always had a difficult time with school, but this way, I'd been able to complete my online classes one day and then have a day of rest to recover from any stress it may have caused me. It's prevented me from becoming burnt out as quickly as before, and now, I feel so weak and stupid for losing my mind over simply going to school every day. Without the crutch of an extra day between classes, I feel dreadful after just a week. Honestly, I'm ashamed of myself. It feels like I should be able to handle this, but instead, I'm drowning. It leaves me feeling anxious for my future; how will I function as an adult in college if I'm having a hard time with this?

I've been spending my nights and lunch hours on the bathroom floor, I hardly got a full night of sleep this week, I can hardly eat; I just feel so tired. I've had my parent's support as I always do, but it's just difficult. My free time has also been somewhat taken over by my anxiety; I can't enjoy anything or relax. I'm always sick or too stressed out to focus on anything I do for fun. It's so hard to explain to my peers as well, why I'm acting ""weird."" When I tell others about my anxiety, they tell me they're anxious too, everyone is anxious right now, everything will be ok, I just need to calm down. Maybe I'm being insensitive, but I can't help but feel like saying, ""no, you don't understand. you being nervous isn't the same as what I'm living with."" It feels so selfish and childish of me to think that way, though. 

I know so many people are going through much worse than this, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. I just feel like my body hates me right now and I have no choice but to just wait for the month to end."
Anxiety,(33f) Does being uncomfortable about your SO keeping tabs on suggestive people mean you're insecure and its your issue?,"
So if your SO is heavily into following, saving,
and actively liking multiple attractive friends suggestive photos (I.E, popular old high school friend who takes pics in her bra/lingerie on FB as a means of luring ppl to buy her Only Fans, old friend he used to hang with who does daily fishnet twerking closeups, or girating, etc)...does that mean that if it bugs you (the GF) , that it means you are insecure and its your problem that you need to get over?"
Anxiety,What part-time jobs could an anxious uni student do?,"Covid has finally cleared up to the point of normal-ish life in my country, and I'm starting Uni in a few weeks, so I'm back to looking for a part time job.  
I've had work before when I was in high-school, as a cashier at a cake shop. It was small and everything with not many customers, but even then I had panic attacks most of the time before my shifts, and I was generally an anxious mess and/or getting over the panic attack aftermath during the shifts and it really didn't go well.  


So, what sorta jobs would be good for someone with social anxiety, who is just out of high school?  
What jobs work for y'all?  
Or do you have any tips for dealing with anxiety while working?  


Thanks in advance for any replies!"
Anxiety,Sleep &amp; Manual Breathing,"I’ve been struggling with high levels of anxiety since December. TL;DR: pandemic, laid off due to pandemic on 10/23, got mild, non-hospitalized COVID on 11/29, went to the ER for a panic or anxiety attack on 12/23.

My PCP started me on 25mg Sertraline on 1/5 to help manage the anxiety (I know it’s a very low/therapeutic dosage). Since then, my ability to sleep has been way out of whack. 

Some nights, I’m able to fall asleep no problem, and sleep through the night (at least 6+ hours). Some nights I’m able to fall asleep but wake up around 4 hours afterwards, and not fall back asleep.

The worst has been this feeling of manual breathing and inability to fall asleep. It’s as if I feel like my brain won’t take over the automatic function of breath, and it keeps me from falling asleep. It’s been rare but I’m currently on day 4 since having a restful nights sleep or even really sleeping at all, and just seeking advice. I take 3mg melatonin daily to help sleep but that hasn’t done the trick of late."
Anxiety,Anxiety about dying early,"Based on the fact that chronic long term stress increases chances of illness and disease and early death.... does anyone have anxiety that they are gonna die early from something awful?  I've had general anxiety disorder since I was a kid, and suffered 3 nervous breakdowns (so far), and I just feel like my body must be decaying from the inside out from the daily non-stop overwhelming stress and anxiety over sooo many years...  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
Anxiety,Heart,"Ok so I have been heart anxious fr about 4 months now...
And my heart has behaved differently every week
I have done echo 2d and ecg done like a month back and they were normal
This week I realised my heart not beating fast enough when I walk around or exercise... and ths is when I try to feel by heartrate by physically placing my hands over my chest
It doesnt cause pain or breathlessness
Has anyone suffered from this?
My heart changes...
When it started i was so anxious...that I used to get heartbeats in my throat and these heartbbeats were very prominent....
Now it has come to this..."
Anxiety,Reminder: Your aim is wrong,"Your aim is not to fight the danger you are now facing.*

Your aim is to label the torture you are in as an anxiety attack and then take active steps towards calming down

This includes realising that the 100s of times before this too, each time your anxiety did reduce, that you were able to sleep after some time, hours or days. 

That it did not actually kill you dozens of times before (or 100s of times before) and therefore it will not kill you this time either.

That the ultimate end state is normalcy and therefore there is no point fighting to prolong the suffering. 

That the moment you stop fighting and start living in the fear state by saying ""I'll manage"", ""there is no fatal danger"", ""I am actually OK apart from this burning and trembling"", that calms your system down and you become more and more peaceful.

So, your aim is not to fight the danger, but to recognise the fight as a fake, name it - anxiety / panic - and then work towards being calm within an hour.

Accept calmness as the end of a panic attack or anxiety attack and aim to reach it as fast as possible. 

I have been able to convince myself over the past few weeks that the endgame of a panic or anxiety attack is calm normalcy and therefore there is no point fighting to prolong the suffering. Seems to work well.

\*Note: This might not work for all cases, but it will help most ordinary cases.

\*Note2: When only positive self-talk is not enough, in such cases, a cold shower, a delicious milk shake / ice-cream / smoothie, a comfy bed, a walk in the park, playing with puppies or animals, feeding birds and such other stronger interventions should be used along with positivity. 

######Once you have a way out of the anxious state, repeat it every time thereafter."
Anxiety,Inpatient,"I’m about to be dropped off at a wilderness therapy program for 3 months. I’ll only have access to my family through my letters and I’m almost 2,000 miles away from home. This is the biggest step I’ve ever taken and I’m terrified. I’ll be backpacking and camping the whole time which only adds to my stress. I just need some love. I’m so stressed and I still have to wait two hours to go to the facility. I’m scared I won’t survive this. I’m so tired."
Anxiety,"Anyone else just ""develop"" new symptoms like tension headaches?","To preface, I have dealt with anxiety for over 5 years and I can usually tell when physical symptoms are anxiety or not. I have done the usual order of things , panic attack, go to the doctor, they tell me im fine. 

However, I recently started feeling a dull annoying feeling that does not hurt but persists throughout the day. My mother is a nurse, and she assures me that it is a tension headache. Has anyone experienced one lasting for over 2 weeks? It never hurts unless i stay out in the sun all the time and I have never had a history of them. Its like a dull throb behind my ears on the sides of my head. It doesnt prevent me from sleeping or doing anything throughout my day, but it is always just ""there"". Any input is appreciated! 

Also, thanks to everyone in this forum, you all who post Q&amp;As have saved me from anxiety more times than I can count!"
Anxiety,What would you say to a 25 year old woman that feels bad about the fact that she wasted her whole life isolating herself at home due to anxiety &amp; low self-esteem ?,🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Anxiety,Overanalyzing as my anxiety seems to be getting worse again,"I find that when my anxiety starts getting worse, I overanalyze things with my boyfriend to death, worrying and imagining problems where they don't exist. Every time he leaves after we've spent time together, I find something to pick apart and worry over. Then I text him about it and feel like such a bother -_- 

I thought I had gotten past this and am so discouraged to notice it happening again. Any advice/is this something you can relate to?"
Anxiety,I joined a Discord call and got a panic attack after,"I'm still writing this whole crying uncontrollably because it just happened an hour ago and I made this throwaway account to vent. 

Basically I'm an upcoming international student (Asian) at an university in an English-speaking country. As I will be doing online study this semester I wanted to meet people online just to make sure I don't miss out on the social aspect. Things went well and I actually started to like chatting to people. I joined my university's Discord, where there are a lot of local people as well. But again, my school is still probably 40% international students, majority of them being Asian.

For the past couple of days I only read the messages and they seem like nice, friendly people. They host Discord game nights almost everyday, and well, wanting to join them for the first time is my mistake.

I panicked hearing their accents cause I'm not used to that, and they talk a bit fast. Just talking and laughing around which each other while I stay silent. Even if that game *should* require some talking. I was just sitting there, not realizing even when they called my name. And I don't know what exactly happened the whole time, but I was in tears when I disconnected from the call. 

I'm not that insecure in my English, I have called the school advisor a couple of times and explained my problems pretty well. I would call myself fluent. I did not think I had a problem communicating with English speakers, but this is the first time I'm putting myself out there to like, 10+ strangers. It was all so intimidating hearing a large group of people talking comfortably and understanding each other well. 

I've had severe anxiety and depression since middle school, never taken any medication and did not go to a lot of therapy sessions either. Before, this would make me shut myself off from everyone new, but I wanted to give it a chance -- I'm attending a new school and they seem to be nice people, what's there to lose? And yet, I hate myself so much afterwards, worrying about what they will think of this weird international kid who apparently can't speak English. I'm afraid I will go back to my ""shell"" again after this experience, but I desperately need some social interaction while doing online school. 

I don't know what steps to take and whether they would let me in again. I hate that my brain is telling me I don't deserve a chance and that everyone hates me now for disturbing their game night. My insecurities of not being raised in an English-speaking country, my mistake of joining when I don't even have to, my fear of not making any friends if it means I have to talk instead of chatting -- everything is making my head hurt so much"
Anxiety,I’m starting to understand anxiety less and less,"I don’t inherently have anxiety, but am surrounded by some who do. My roommate specifically has struggled with sleep for many months now. I’ve given him all of the tip and tricks I know and nothing really seems to help. Now I know this is going to sound dumb but I don’t get it. Just anxiety as a whole, I’ve had instances of anxiety towards situations (work, school, etc) but never just all of the time. How does that work? What is happening to make you anxious? Why can’t you just relax? This might sound patronizing but I am genuinely curious. I wish to help, but don’t know where to start."
Anxiety,"Do weighted blankets help with Anxiety? If so, which one would you recommend?",Title says it all.
Anxiety,Maybe anxiety is affecting me and I just did not want to pay attention to it. I'm writing this to calm myself down a little bit.,"To say that I didn't know would be a lie but I thought it was something I could get through eventually on my own. I couldn't. It hasn't gone away.

I'm 19. I'm at work right now. I started my first job in january and it's quite normal feeling nervous the first time. The people around me are kind and gentle, I love my eviroment overall. My job requires from me being able to work under pressure and I can totally do it. It's an office job. The money isn't good but I'm doing it because I was doing nothing at home and I dropped out of university since I can't do online classes (I live in Venezuela, you can guess why) and it's a job somehow linked to my career so I said why not. It was an incredible opportunity to took.

So far I'm doing great but this morning happening something that's been happened from a long time ago, but for some reason I wanted to talk about it now. For me it was just ""feeling nervous"" that's why I dismissed the symptons. But I've been reading a little bit more about anxiety and panic attacks and it clicked right away.

I sleep very well, I don't wake up tired even though I wake up a lot during the night (I move a lot). My appetite is normal, I don't overeat nor do I skip my meals. I feel great most of the time. But when it comes to social interactions, going out without planning it, feeling ""exposed"" to the outer world, I can't help but feel sick. I feel weak.

I'm totally introverted, not something I'm saying in a proud way but more like ""I've accepted that's my way of being"" way (Is it the same?). If I was able to be alone all day, all week or even a whole month perhaps, I would feel totally fine. I don't necesarily go out, I don't like it. I do hang out with friends although not as regularly as the rest of them do. It drains me interacting with people. I enjoy being alone.

When I go out to some place, all planned beforehand, I never feel like this but when I'm outside, in the ""unknown"", when I feel uncertainty, my hearts starts beating faster than I think it should, my digestive process screws with me to the point that I have to puke or poop so I can feel better. I sweat cold and it becomes difficult to breathe. I feel dizzy and I would spend almost two hours feeling without strength. It usually happens in the mornings. In the afternoons, God knows why, I feel more relaxed and ""sure"" that everything is going to be okay.

It happened a lot when I was studying too, when I had classes in the mornings and even worse, when I had exams in the morning. Going to public bathrooms is the worst, but breathing exercises didn't work.

I thought I could handle it by myself because it embarrases me if anyone else knows I go through this. But I think the first step to overcome this is accepting that I'm not feeling good and that's okay. I haven't told my parents about this but I hope they understand and support me. I'm aware that to some exent I'll have to do this alone since it's hard to get professional help but knowing about my symptons lessen my anxiety. Writing and reading like I'm doing right now works superb. At the beginning of this post I was about to tell my boss I needed the day off, I was feeling terrible, incompetent, at the verge of crying even, but now I feel better. I'm still nervous but just a little bit. Even though I haven't posted it it feels so good to feel listened to. This morning I was feeling like I was gonna fail, like if I was gonna die.

It didn't happen to me when I was younger, not like this at least. I do remember some similar moments but in comparison to how I felt the rest of the day, it's different. 

I like this job and I don't want to have to quit in the future because of this. If you can give me some advice or if you want to educate me on something I would very much appreciate it. Sorry if this is a but messy, for the most part I'm just writing things to calm myself down. Also as you can tell, english isn't my first language so if I mess up, a correction doesn't sound bad. THANK YOU if you read all of this. If you're going through something similar, let me tell you that I'll have you in my thoughts, consistently, wishing you the best this world can offer. Everything is going to be okay. &lt;3"
Anxiety,How many of you think that fighting anxiety with a recovery buddy is better than fighting it all alone?,"And as a followup to that question, does anyone know any ""recovery buddy"" sites, programs, or services?

The reason I say recovery buddy and not therapist is that with a therapist or a psychologist, you know that you're broken and they are healthy experts so the sense of loneliness in danger does not go away, whereas if you have a recovery buddy, you know that you are not alone. 

Not being alone in your danger takes away half the danger."
Anxiety,mini crisis,"my anxiety got better for a few days but now it’s come back twice as hard. Whenever i make progress, it fires back at me. 

I feel like I can’t breathe all the time. I can’t feel oxygen entering me or i feel like it’s not enough, I feel like it’s not ‘working’ or ‘doing anything’. My body feels heavy. The slightest sensation sends me into panic. The feeling of my fingers against my hand? Panic. Feet on the floor? Panic.

I don’t know what to do but I’m struggling at school. I keep having terrible panic attacks in class. I’m just so angry that everything is a challenge for me. I’m never going to live a normal life.

Anxiety,I'm 22 years old and I want to kill myself,I want to kill myself without passing the pain onto my family. I just don't want to feel this way anymore.

He's in a special education program, where he's supposed to be getting therapy alongside regular schooling, but we haven't been able to get him to go to school on a regular basis.  We're lucky if it's once or twice a week, and he will absolutely not go in before 10AM, since he seems to be avoiding his first 2 classes.  We also haven't been able to get him to visit his therapist in several months.

I think we're getting to the point where being home all the time is not providing the environment he needs to learn some coping skills so he can function in society.  Are there residential programs for teenagers out there that we might send him to live and learn for a little while?  I realize that getting him to agree to go is going to be a huge challenge, but I'd like at least start the discussion with him."
Anxiety,How to deal with exam anxiety [Question],"Hey guys,

I'm 22M. So pretty much here's my history: I was diagnosed with severe anxiety in late 2019 after I went through burn-out from my first university degree and switched universities because I felt I was getting nowhere with my life. Currently I am in therapy.

So for pretty much of my life I've mainly suffered from very bad exam anxiety which basically includes:

* Constantly searching for reassurance from close friends if I would be able to pass the exam or not. 
* Being afraid and anxious about sitting the exam round about a day before the exams.
* Constantly obsessing over what might be on the paper, and being afraid not to be able to sleep the night before.
* Constantly wanting to listen to my inner heartbeat. 

I do actually study very hard for the exams - harder than the average person - however I'm not able to use that as a certain amount as ""satisfaction"" to reduce these anxious tendencies. 

In the past I nearly spun into OCD about a day before the exams but have managed to deal with that aspect thanks to my therapist. 

I was just wondering if anyone here has maybe experienced this kind of situation before and if he/she maybe has some advice to offer which might make these situations a little more bareable. I'd appreciate any advice given.

Stay safe you all!"
Anxiety,meditation with anxiety advice?,"Hello! Massive anxiety week as I have an interview Wednesday. I meditate most mornings, but this morning was particularly difficult because even with no thoughts running through my head, my anxiety physically feels like a bruise being poked every time my heart beats.

I know meditation should help, but it is just so painful right now. does anyone have advice for how to meditate through severe anxiety?"
Anxiety,I'm going to school tomorrow after 1 year as my school have opened but I'm really nervous!!!,"Well so I'm from Delhi, India and I'm an 11th grader. My school is starting from tomorrow but I'm very tensed. I have various reasons for tension like:

1. My assignments are not up to date which were given during online class.
2. I'm repeating my 11th standard with a different stream. Last year I was in science but I didn't do well so this year I am studying arts. But my peers are now my seniors and they would probably question me about my decision and stuff.
3. I know nothing about my new classmates and stuff.
4. Also during the lockdown period I kind of became a shut-in and rarely went out so going out and interacting with people would be kinda.........you know"

Anxiety,Online group therapy,"Hello,

Though the last few years I've been handling my anxiety much better but between COVID, the second lockdown (here in Ontario), and dealing with other health problems has gotten me in a really low place. Before the pandemic, I found attending group therapy weekly helped a lot. I was wondering if anyone knows any online group therapy resources?"

Anxiety,I feel a void when I'm not busy,"Whenever I have freetime during the day I feel a void. Like I feel too bored to do most things and too anxious to start any long-term goals. It results in me laying in bed, smoking weed to past the time or sometimes literally just staring at the clock waiting for the day to be over."
Anxiety,Talking To My Doctor About Going On Meds Today,"I (23M) have been dealing with anxiety pretty consistently for my entire life. I’ve gone to therapy sporadically but it’s never gotten to the point where it’s been completely, cripplingly unmanageable. That has changed in the last several months. I’ve recently developed pretty severe health anxiety (and not just about COVID, I can’t tell you how many cancers I’ve diagnosed myself with in the last 6 weeks). So I’ve decided to talk to my doctor about going on meds, even if it’s for the short term. I just wanna know what I should expect from the appointment (what I should remember to communicate, what questions the doc might ask me, etc.). I just want to be as prepared as possible."

Anxiety,My dad's house has become an anxiety generator.,"I overanalyze his every move. I'm just scared he'll be upset at me or if I'm hurting his feelings. I can't talk to him about it out of fear of conflict, because I just can't handle a conversation where I express hurt but all he expresses is anger.

I've been feeling things I've never felt before. I've been having anxiety attacks pretty much daily, and I've been flinching at loud noises (FLINCHING, I've never been that scared of something!) and I absolutely can't focus on online school. I wish I'd chosen in-person switching, because at least for 6h a day 5 days a week I wouldn't be here.

Whenever I'm not here I'm pretty much fine. If I'm at my mom's house she's so understanding, she's not perfect but at least she listens to what I have to say. As soon as I get a text from my dad my heart races, I think a million thoughts and try to not upset him.

I don't know how it got to this. I just want to be alone."
Anxiety,People telling you to get over it?,"Hi, I’ve always been a mildly anxious person. Over the years I have become more aware of it. 

The past several months my new job was turning me into an anxious mess, where I’d break down crying at least once a month. This place was not good for my mental health as I was constantly being blamed, accused, and scolded for asking questions. I found another job and will be starting soon. 

Today I called out because I felt myself on the brink of an anxiety attack. When I got off the phone I broke down what felt like a bottled up can of emotions. My mom told me that I have to learn to get over it and acting like this makes me look stupid. I typically display myself very well and poised but my anxiety has just been a tough battle lately. 

Is my mom right though? Is this making me look stupid to others?"
Anxiety,DAE feel like everyone hates them?,"For years, I've solely dealt with depression. The last year or so, I've noticed symptoms of anxiety. It has only become more prevalent as time passes on. 

Now, I have a constant knot in my stomach. I can't stop wondering if those I care about hate me. Even when I know, deep down, that they don't, the anxiety of the thought is horrible. 

Are my parents mad at me? Are they disappointed in me? Do they wish I was different? Could they hate me? 

Does my partner hate me? Does he regret dating and meeting me? Does he wish he never moved in with me? Is he going to leave me? 

I don't know how to stop the thought and feeling. I can dismiss it after a while and convince myself that it's not true, but it hurts me. And when I communicate about it, they feel hurt. They wonder if they don't show love enough, or if they're doing something wrong."
Anxiety,"Please help, Corona led to anxiety","My mom is currently suffering from anxiety. She was healthy and then got corona on December 13. Then around January, after she recovered, she got weak and can't sleep. She went to doctors, and had blood work and everything came back normal. Then she went to cardiologist and had her heart monitored and everything was normal. The doctor gave her escitalopram and she took it but she couldn't take it anymore after 4 days. Then her doctor gave her buspirone and my mom took it one day and couldn't do it. Her symptons is feeling weak in legs, pain in chest, headache, heart palpitations, especially during night. Shes not getting any sleep, and wondering if theres any help. Any suggestions would help"
Anxiety,"Does anyone else get panicked by bodily sensations that are not related to anxiety/panic attacks, but mimic the feelings of one?","That may have sounded a little bit confusing, so I’ll give a few examples:

1) I was walking to get the mail the other day, and it was COLD. My legs were freezing, and once I got into the post office, they began to warm up, leaving me with that “numb/tingly” leg feeling. This feels similar to when your legs go numb during a panic attack. Fast forward, my mind gets tricked into thinking I’m going to have a panic attack, which adds to the panic and fear.

2) Listening to loud music in the car. You’re done your drive, and get out to go into the house, a store, etc. and your hearing is a bit muffled. This is similar to when your hearing goes wonky during a panic attack, so your brain associates the two, again, creating unneeded panic.

I wanna know if this is just a ME thing, or if it’s common. Regionally my brain knows that there’s nothing to worry about and can pinpoint exactly why I feel what I’m feeling, but my body just doesn’t want to catch up!"
Anxiety,Constant pain in the heart (pinching sensation),"So I’ve had anxiety for years now and my anxiety has always manifested in terrible ways : shortness of breath, chest pains and heart cramps.

Anxiety,Husband keeps having panic attacks. How can I help?,"My husband has (prior to me meeting him) been diagnosed with having severe(?) anxiety. He’s gotten better at being on the phone and that’s great, but sometimes I forget and expect a bit too much of him. 

He’s been out of work for a while and he’s fallen in this habit of just lazing around (he is getting government money with the added Covid bonus, so that’s been helping SO much and taking a bit of pressure of me)

His last job was a Christmas one and only lasted a month before the stall stopped existing. 

The one before that was going great until Covid shut it down and he was let go (being one of the last employees to have been hired). 

The one before that I believe he was getting so anxious at that he was feeling unwell every day. He’d get through half a day and get so feint he needed to sit down for a while and just wasn’t able to get back to it. It also didn’t help he got an ingrown toenail towards the end. 

He’s recently done a trial for a new job (gingers crossed) on a Wednesday. It was a very quiet shift, he tells me, and he’s freaking out already because even during this quiet shift he almost had a panic attack. 

I don’t know if there’s anything I can do to help at all. I don’t want to push him too much, but I don’t know what a good push is for him. I don’t know if he’s reacting this way because it’s just been so long or what. 

Can anyone help?"

Anxiety,How to deal with anxiety over phone notifications?,"So, I've recently entered a long-distance relationship with a guy on the other side of the world to me. Everything's great when we get to call each other, but when it comes to sending messages to each other, we're struggling a lot.

Basically, my boyfriend was in a borderline mentally abusive long-distance relationship in the past, and because of it he feels severe stress and anxiety whenever he checks his phone and notices that he has unread messages. He explained to me that because of that, he puts off reading his messages and replying.

I totally understand his perspective, but unfortunately as a result it's putting a strain on our new relationship because message communication is more or less non-existent from him. And since I suffer from a lot of issues with anxiety, etc. myself, when he doesn't reply, my own brain goes haywire and tries to convince me that it's because he doesn't actually like me and that he doesn't want to be with me anymore.

The two of us had an open, honest discussion about this earlier today and we both agreed that we wanted to work together to find a middle ground with communication that works for us both. But when it comes to trying to make him feel less anxiety from message notifications, I have no idea where to start.

One idea I'm considering is starting slow and letting him know ahead of time what I will message him about and at what time - for example, he's starting back at work tomorrow after a few months off, and I promised him that when he finished work, I would message him to ask how his first day back went. The hope is that by knowing what the message will be ahead of time, when he receives it he won't have the same panicked response because he knows it's just me.

Does that seem like something that would work to help him start to deal with the problem? If not, do any of you have any other suggestions? We both want to work together to get his brain to 'unlearn' this anxious response to notifications, it's not just me trying to force him to change it.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated."
Anxiety,Thank you to this sub for being a lifeline in a low period in my life.,"The end of 2018, I had just moved cross country, started a job that was high pressure and not for me, and I almost had a nervous breakdown and ended up in the ER with a panic attack. At 26, I felt like I was a life failure and that I should switch careers. I remember lurking in this sub a lot, feeling really empty, and like my life was a mess.   


Since then, I got a new, better job more suited for my ADHD, where I can work autonomously without people breathing down my neck. It pays 15% more salary than my last job. I got back on ADHD medication. I celebrate my 2 year here in May, the longest I've been at any job. My performance at work is praised. I can complete tasks and stay relaxed.   


I started going to therapy every single week the past year and a half, initially for work anxiety, then we started digging into trauma, how I project my trauma subconsciously into everyday situations, causing a lot of anxiety, and working through it. It is dirty, messy, work. I now recognize my anxious and/or emotional responses in situations, understand why they come up and where they come from. I can finally attempt to self soothe. 

I started having boundaries in friendships and my work. I recognized that I am an anxious people pleaser and I take on more than I can handle to be ""liked"". I started saying no. I met my boyfriend a few months after I left that job, and he understands my anxiety issues and is a sweetheart. We now live together.   


I got a haircut this past weekend. When I arrived at the salon I had been to before, my stylist was still with another client, and so someone else shampooed my hair. I sat under the sink angry, anxious, wanting to cry, and emotional, thinking my stylist didn't care about me, she sucks, yada yada yada.   


Then I reminded myself that this is a trauma response out of fear of rejection and abandonment, and that the stylist would take her time on my hair as well. She started and owns the salon, she's just behind, and knows what she's doing. I started to feel better and relax, joking with the apprentice combing out my hair after shampooing it. It has taken 18 months of therapy to be able to do this. The stylist did take her time, and I left the salon with a haircut I love.   


Thanks to this sub for the resources and the motivation to keep going. I've come so far and feel like there is so much work to be done, but I know I can get through it."

Because of my grades I get invited to many interviews... I hate it!! At the moment im waiting for a reply from a big firm, absolute dream salary and cool topics...

I really can’t describe the symptom other than it being physical and really strange, it kind of takes my breathe away or feels like my heart stops for a quick second. Any ideas? PS I have had a heart test/halter test a couple times and seemingly nothing is wrong. It’s a weird random physical sensation that ends up putting me in an anxious whirl wind"
Anxiety,Intermittent GAD Symptoms,"Hi there, 

Let me just start by saying that I was always an anxious individual. 

Although, a bit more than a year ago, I started feeling anxious all the time with various symptoms like loads of adrenaline, churning stomach, dizziness, dp/dr, brain fog, lots of intrusive thoughts etc. I was terrified of how I felt, thought I was slowly drifting into madness.

Problem is that GAD is supposed to be constant, for me it's more like every couple of weeks, I get into that state where it really feels like GAD, but then, it fades after a few days. 

I've contacted my doctor recently to have blood tests to check for potential problems with my Thyroid, but she told me since it's COVID, it's gonna take around 2 months before I can get an appointment. This is really disappointing as I really wanna dismiss any health issues before knowing if it's really just anxiety. But, I guess I just gotta wait and be confident that there's a way out of this mess.

I started doing meditation, exercise, eating more healthy but that wasn't really helping as I was still fearing the symptoms, the anxiety. It did help to reduce the symptoms though.

A couple of weeks ago, I started reading Hope and Help for Your Nerves by Claire Weekes and watching Shaan Kassam videos on Youtube and that gave me a different point of view on the whole situation. My last attack was a week ago and lasted until Friday. I was still scared but tried the float in the symptoms and that really helped. Now Saturday, I felt really good, almost no anxiety, no symptoms, I was truly happy and confident that I was gonna get through this ordeal.

The only thing worrying me is that this is not GAD, since it's not consistent, but an underlying health problem, testosterone imbalance or else.

So I guess my question is, did anybody have a fluctuating / intermittent GAD that was not caused by a health issue and did you managed to get over it ? How so ?

I'm a dad &amp; a husband who's a bit desperate, I need some encouragements. Thanks for listening :)"
Anxiety,Social Anxiety in the Classroom,"I am a college student who has been struggling with anxiety for years, but it’s gotten worse this semester due to one class in particular. I have a class over Zoom in which half the students are live in the classroom and the other half is virtual. Our class is very discussion based, and lucky for me, my professor is the kind of teacher that calls on random students who don’t have their hands raised to answer questions or share their thoughts. This is a huge trigger for my anxiety. I am always attentive in class and formulating responses in my head, and occasionally I’ll even feel confident enough to jump in and share myself. But on several occasions he has called me out directly to answer a question and regardless of whether or not I had an answer in my head, the second I’m called on my mind blanks and I can’t speak. It’s like no matter how hard I think, every smart thing I had in my brain disappears. This class has been mentally draining because I’m constantly fearing being called on and it’s interfering with my ability to learn the material. I’m not sure what to do about it, but I’m sick of being embarrassed and made to feel stupid. Today I broke down and cried after class because of it. Any advice?"
Anxiety,I'm worried my girlfriend doesn't want to be with me,"As the title says, I'm worried she doesn't want to be with me anymore. But my anxiety makes me too scared to ask. I don't want to bother her with my worries in case they aren't true, and I'm just seeking reassurance again."
Anxiety,I have a meeting with my managers today that I'm dreading,"My department director (3rd level manager) wants to meet with me, my manager, and 2nd level manager later today to discuss my concerns working during the office during the pandemic.

I've told my manager multiple times that people aren't taking the mask policy seriously, including people in my group that I'll be working more closely with soon (within 6ft). I've asked to work remotely, at least part time, and it's been denied. The company has no consequences for people who don't comply with the policy.

I'm hoping this meeting will go well and that I won't have too much anxiety during. Just sitting at my desk waiting for the end of the day is starting to weigh on me. I just want to be able to approach it professionally and not break down. I'm trying to rehearse what to say but I'm getting nervous that I won't be able to remember everything, and I don't want to write notes to read during because I'm afraid of how it will look (confrontational? Unnecessary?)

Also I'm not sure what the result will be, and I'm expecting the worst (no changes). I'm just so frustrated and it's taken a huge toll on my mental health lately that I just don't know what to do anymore."
Anxiety,Weightlifting causing physical anxiety,"Some background info: I am diagnosed with panic disorder.

When I was on antidepressants for my panic disorder, I was able to lift without any problem, and gained strength and size, going from a skinny kid deadlifting a max of 75lbs to doing 225lbs. Now that I'm off antidepressants, on days I lift, I get terrible symptoms such as but not limited to nausea, headaches, tingling in my body, etc. I've tried reducing intensity but as long as I start going a bit harder, I get bad panic symptoms. On other days, my panic disorder has been dormant. I feel ok. If I lift groceries for a bit, or carry my bike around, or do a few light sets of dumbbell curls, I'm good too.

I was wondering whether it was really lifting that is causing it. So far, running, sprinting, cycling, boxing and swimming don't give me this problem. I've also controlled other variables and tested it out, such as food and sleep, but the single variable that always causes my problem is weightlifting. I've also taken long periods of rest (2 weeks - 1 month) just to rule out overtraining. 

Does anyone else have experience this problem? Or any similar issues with exercise?"
Anxiety,Work Anxiety,"Just a disclaimer, I’ve never really been clinically diagnosed with anxiety but it’s always bothered me ever since high school.

I graduated college with honors and have been working in marketing for almost 2 years now. What I’ve noticed since I started working and even when I was interning before is that I’m always so worried about not meeting my bosses’ expectations of me and not being competent enough for the job. Meetings always trigger this because sometimes I feel like I’m not speaking up as much as everyone else is, and then I keep thinking about what I can say and end up not saying anything at all. I’m the type of person who can’t think on her toes and has to do her research before stuff like this. But that’s not always the case at work. One of the things my boss said she wanted from me was to speak up more— which makes me even more anxious now. I feel like workplaces really favor extroverted people, and I just can’t be that person even if I try. 

The thing is, the stress is all self inflicted. The place I work at is actually really great. No one messages after working hours and everything is output based. Will it always feel this way?

I try to workout after work everyday and take weekends off. I even take certificate programs online when I’m feeling extra incompetent. But none of those do the trick still. What can I do to get rid of this feeling?"
Anxiety,Random anxiety attack out of nowhere?,"First of all, I just want to say sorry cause I don't even know if this is the right sub for this and I was just confused of what just happened. Second, I have not seen a doctor yet for medical diagnoses nor am I seeking for one, again I'm just curious.  


  
I have not experience something like this throughout my entire life until the following years. It didn't happen frequently and only occurred twice and in both of those times it felt like it came out of nowhere. I don't even know if that was anxiety attack or something but I was just laying there in my bed about to go to sleep then it slowly started. I felt like I was scared of something and felt like this sort of sinking feeling, I don't know how to explain it but I guess that's the closest thing I can think of. Then I started shaking, not severely but if I put my hand out it's definitely visible. Then my heart starts to palpate and I start to huff, It felt like I just ran a mile or two, I don't know if it was part of the attack or it was because I was confused of what was happening to me. It really just came out of nowhere and I never felt like that before. It lasted for approximately 5-10 mins but I was only able to sleep hours later after that event.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm sorry if this wasn't the right sub to post this to. I mean no harm in my post and I am more than willing to remove or move this post if I am told to do so.

Thank you all for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day ❤"
Anxiety,Anxiety about in-law living with us,"It hasn't happened yet, but I have extremely high anxiety about my future in-law living with us full-time sometime in the future. I even pray that he gets married to ANYONE before then so he won't have to live with us. I feel selfish but I just don't want him to live with us every day and do everything with us. I talked to my fiance about needing to have time for just us when that happens and he didn't seem to be on board and just said that he would have to go everywhere with us (vacation, seeing my family, etc.). I just feel like I'll see my family on weekends when my fiance is off work so that I can just go by myself. This in-law has some memory issues but can work and should be able to live on his own but he chooses not to and chooses to act incompetent so that people do everything for him. He has no desire to be independent even though he could be. I know this is everywhere but I have to get it out. I just took some anxiety meds (organic from Amazon) and I just need to vent a little. I love my fiance enough to deal with all this (this in-law has been here about 6 months out of the last year - 2 weeks a month) but I know it's going to be frustrating sometimes."
Anxiety,I can't eat because I feel food gets stuck in my throat,"I'm thinking I actually have an issue which im going to be speaking to the doctor about thursday, but it is totally blown out of proportion because of how anxious I am. This has been going on a week now, I'm eating soups and thats about it.  


I want to cry. I went from being fine with eating to not being fine with eating within a few days and it's getting worse. I used to love food, look forward to it and enjoy it and now I get super anxious at the thought and haven't ate a full meal for a week or more, outside of soup.   


I already had crippling agoraphobia OCD and panic disorder but now this on top of it is going to send me over the edge. It all started from a lump/feeling of something caught in my throat and a sore throat, I think i had an inflamed taste bud at the back of my throat which went away but now this is the result. I just cannot bring myself to swallow food and when I do I feel like there's parts left in my throat that do not go down properly. It's a horrible feeling and it makes me super anxious. with covid as well I am going to struggle to get checked out.   


I have zero support around me and I know I cant deal with this alone.   


Has anyone had a similar problem? What are the solutions? Im thinking of ordering meal replacement shakes until I can see someone and find out if this is a physical issue or anxiety related"

Anxiety,Heart Rate while running concerns,"Running Heart Rate concerns

So I’ve had this concern for a little while, and I’m going to talk to a doctor about it this Thursday, but I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience when running. I have a ton of tight muscles, and I think a few irritated nerves in my spine, and wonder if this effects my heart rate or stress on my body when running. I wonder this because my heart rate gets up to 210 when full on sprinting. I look this up and many people say that it’s unhealthy, unnatural, and that it is a tell-tale sign of a heart issue. The thing about this is, my heart rate drops very quickly after reaching this. I’m talking from 200/210-160/170 within 1 minute. Within 10 minutes my heart rate is then below 100 and I never have any spikes or irregular beats. I do feel my heartbeat more a lot, but that seems to be anxiety. I have done ekgs at home and they come back normal, even after a review by a cardiologist through the app, who said it was sinus arrhythmia and fine. My blood pressure is also fine, at around 120/70. Is there anything to be concerned about here? People on quora are brutal."
Anxiety,"Whenever I try to invite people to challenge my ideas, I get attacked, get more anxious, which just conditions me to shut down further.","Like for instance I have some unpopular ideas that a particular group of people acts in ways that make them inferior. When I explain the actions they would have to take for me to change my view, I get attacked and insulted, which adds evidence to my views rather than refutes them. It also makes me more anxious about trying to be open-minded, but why the fuck shouldn't I be more anxious when I just get attacked and get very little emotional support?"
Anxiety,DAE feel like your method of personal expression has been shaped by your anxiety?,"Just curious to see what people say. I basically attribute my choice in fashion to my anxiety. I have a lot of difficulty communicating with other people so I have always tried to express myself through shoes at first, but also clothing now as well. Wearing new or different clothes/shoes always used to give me anxiety, especially in high school, but now it has become almost a comfort. My social anxiety always had me worrying about what others thought of me, so now every time I try something different in my fashion choices it's a small win for me. Because of that I have slowly cared less and less about what people think of my clothes over time. Now I basically just use it as a way to express myself that doesn't give me much anxiety. I still find it difficult to wear new clothes, but every time I do I gain just a little more confidence in myself and I get to feel normal for a little while until I accidentally make eye contact with someone (lol)."
Anxiety,Is my dosage of xanax normal?,"I call my doctor every two months to refill my xanax, i get 14 pills of .5mg. Im a very anxious and depressed person since i went through a traumatic family death so i end up taking it whenever im having a bad day, it usually lasts me the two months. But ive become anxious that if i call for a refill every two months on the dot she'll get frustrated and tell me i take it too much. Is my dosage pretty typical??"
Anxiety,Health anxiety suddenly overwhelming,"Hi, I’ve read through the other health anxiety posts so I know it’s a pretty common thing on this thread. I’m just having a horrible past few weeks jumping from one anxiety attack to the next over random things that I used to be able to talk myself out of. I’ve downloaded the Dare app which helps to calm me some, and I quit googling long ago. I just have one single twinge of a new feeling and go into anxiety attack mode. Today it’s trying some new micro greens. I KNOW logically that I am ok. I am not allergic to anything and have never developed a random allergy in my life. But one of the greens was a little spicy. Can’t remember what it was, it made my mouth tingle and now I’m convinced it’s an allergic reaction. My throat will close up at any minute. I’m breathing fine and I have Benadryl in case, but I really don’t want to become dependent on medicines. I’ve already taken my anxiety pill for the day so basically I’m just asking for reassurance and maybe solutions that have worked for other people with health anxiety to calm themselves down. I hate it so much because as much as I am logical about an issue, my anxiety just consumes me. I know I’m fine and it will pass, but convincing my nervous system of that seems impossible. Yoga makes me focus on my breath and then I start to stress about that, getting my heart rate up can trigger it, being too hot or cold—it feels like I cannot win to save my life. It’s making my life miserable. I never used to be so unable to get out of an anxiety attack. I’m really at a loss here. It feels like I’ll never be free of it again. I try to keep going. Do the dishes, play a game, read a book, take my classes. Which help for a bit, but I always end up back in an anxious cycle thinking about every little feeling. It feels hopeless."
Anxiety,Teachers in my school district are protesting today and I want to visit my old elementary school and see if my kindergarten teacher’s there,"Posting so the pressure of knowing other people expect me to actually do it helps me... you know, actually do it. My kindergarten teacher is my favorite teacher I’ve ever had but, considering she teaches kindergarten and I’m no longer a kindergartener, I haven’t seen her in a long time. But I live only a couple blocks away from the school and I found out today through one of my current teachers that teachers are protesting at their schools and he said we could probably go visit our old schools and see if our teachers were there in the yard, and I’m honestly really tempted to go.

Problem is I probably look like a 6th grader and would look really weird just randomly showing up and awkwardly stalking the perimeter of the school, my mom would be very confused and question me on why I suddenly want to take a walk out of nowhere, and there’s no guarantee that any teachers will be at the school at all, much less the specific one I want to visit. But fuck it. Even if she isn’t there, I’ll get some alone time out of the house and if she is, I can catch up with her and show her how I’ve grown since the quiet, timid, lonely kid I used to be. I’ll probably feel stupid if she isn’t there or if the entire school is empty or if she is there but I have no idea if I’m allowed to actually enter the yard, but, well, the whole point of me forcing myself to do this is to get over that stress and do it anyway.

Time to psyche myself up for the next half hour and pray I’m not too late."

Anxiety,How do you overcome work/manager anxiety?,"I've had a lot of nasty bosses in my working life and that caused me to develop an anxiety response to anyone that is my manager even if they are nice or they haven't acted in a way to warrant those feelings. 

Even now with a new job and new bosses I still feel that sense of anxiety around them that I did with some of my previous managers. I think that those feelings had become so normalised that previously I wasn't even aware of them but now at a new job I realised that they make no sense. 

I think it's because of the fear that your boss holds so much power over you and I am afraid that I could make a mistake and they decide that they don't want me to work there any more which did happen once in the past. I've had other bosses that clearly had anger issues.

I know that they have affected me because I can be quite twitchy/jumpy as well and I have that kind of anxious awareness where when they're around then I can't relax and feeling self conscious causes me to make more mistakes where as when I am doing the work by myself then I can do the job perfectly fine.

How can I overcome anxiety towards work and my managers?"
Anxiety,bad anxiety about fleas in house,"i have a phobia of bugs and insects, some species trigger it way more than others. today i found out this definitely applies to fleas as i found out two of my cats have them (and worms!). i have already gotten them and the rest of my cats a good flea and worm treatment, but im having extreme anxiety about it tonight.

i feel really stupid for not noticing the problem already and i genuinely have no idea how to know how long we’ve had fleas in the house. both of my cats sleep on my bed and i noticed some in my bed which makes me feel sick. i washed everything from my bed with hot water, vacuumed and moved furniture, and used a flea spray on the floor and mattress. 

i feel really paranoid tonight and feel itchy. im so convinced it’s really bad and will be something im gonna deal with for a while. im so scared that they’re in my hair, i’ve accidentally swallowed them, they’ll crawl up my leg while sleeping, etc. to the point that i keep checking my sheets with a flashlight and am scared to be in the dark. i don’t even wanna get out of my bed because i know they’re in the carpet. i also have a messy ass closet quite frankly and i am terrified because i feel like im not going to eradicate the problem until i am able to take care of the clutter in there. im so busy and depressed tbh, it sounds like so much to tackle for me at the moment. knowing there’s so many steps i’d need to take to really take care of the problem without professional help is making me panic.

i feel too paranoid to close my eyes right now and go to sleep, i literally am to the point of wanting to go sleep at someone else’s house due to intrusive thoughts. i wanna pay an exterminator to come but im really broke. it makes me sick to think about even walking on my carpet because i know there are eggs and dead fleas! i know it sounds so insane and i know im being irrational, but i can’t shake the fear. i can’t tell if im actually even itchy or if it’s just the paranoia, as i’ve washed everything on my bed and used spray + vacuum. i feel like im in hell and this is only my first night knowing of the infestation. i’ve definitely known i had a bit of a phobia to tapeworms and parasites in the past and my cat has worms from the fleas. i am even slightly scared i could get worms this way even though i know it’s so rare. i feel like it’d just be my luck, to somehow swallow an infected flea in my sleep or something because im too fucking disconnected from the present to even realize there’s fleas in my bed and on my cats"
Anxiety,I'm afraid to get close to people.,"I wasn't sure whether to post this on here or the trauma toolbox subreddit. I have an intense fear of getting close to people, both emotionally and physically. This means it is very stressful for me to make friends and keep meaningful friendships. 

An example of what will usually happen:
I'll start talking to someone nice online and we have a chill conversation. Once things start to become personal, or maybe if the person is local and they mention wanting to meet up, it's all downhill from there. I get triggered. My anxiety will suddenly skyrocket and I'll feel incredibly guilty for some reason. The end result is usually me, swiftly deleting and blocking them on everything and never talking to them again. No warning from me, nothing. It's like my brain commands me to do it without explanation. I hate it but I'm so scared to get close. What do I have to do to stop this reaction?"
Anxiety,I worry that I may have broken a promise that I cant remember and all that comes from a bad feeling,"Somehow, I have connected a mod for a pc game with my ocd. That was probably, 2.5-3.5 years ago. I am not sure how or why I connected it. I think, I have some memories of worrying to use that mod because it reminded me something from my ocd fear which was a specific punishment from Christian God. I think, thats the only ""scary"" thing that I remember for that mod.

Months passed, and I think, I was always avoiding to download,use that mod or even see it on youtube. Somehow, it was giving me a scary feeling related to my ocd. That made me suspect that I may have made a rushed promise to Christian God.

Time passed and I was avoiding it without analyzing it much. I think, I would get a bad feeling and then, I will be like ""lets avoid it because i may have made a promise to Christian God and asked for a punishment.""

In 2019, I was trying to remember which ocd promises were the scariest. And I labeled that ""hypothetical promise about the mod"" as something that must not be broken.

Some days ago, I may have broken that hypotehtical promise because I saw, MAYBE ON PURPOSE, the thumbnail of a youtube video that had a mod on the sequel of the game that its mod I was avoiding it. It was not the same game (it was its sequel) and it was not the same mod. but still, it was a mod for almost, the same game series.

I think, that the reason I am worrying is because I was avoiding that mod for a long time and I reached to a point that I labeled it as something that needs to be avoided. lets say, potentially dangerous.

The thing is that I am worrying that I may have made a promise to Christian God to avoid that mod and asked for a specific punishment in case breaking the promise. I worry that maybe Christian God is not real and other Gods who do not care so much about my ocd, accepted the promise/deal.

For many months, I was avoiding that mod because of a bad feeling. I worry that I may have made a promise to Gods not to ever use/see that mod in that game and asked for specific punishment. I have a good memory and I do not remember making such a promise. And I think, I would never dare to ask for that punishment. That calms me down.

Since I remember nothing,means there is no promise. But still, I have a bad feeling about that, as if there is something that I am forgeting. What if I made a rushed promise and forgot it?

I imagine myself making that promise and I remember nothing. But on the same time, I get a feeling that it is not impossible to have made a promise.

All that worry comes from a bad feeling that I have connected it with my ocd fear."

I just wanted to know if anyone here has had a good experience with prozac. I am going to start taking it and I am a bit nervous, but also excited. I am hesitant as well, because my doctor also prescribed me Adderall with the prozac and I looked up that those have a bad interaction.

Anxiety,Crippled,"Hi. I know there’s more than a massive bucket-full of shit wrong with the world right now but I feel like I’m just cursed. Awkwardness and anxiety fill at least half of every day’s time, and it makes everything go a lot lot slower.

It’s a rare occurrence that I get excited, and when I do it’s usually to hang out and booze with friends. However, no matter the situation, I always get a tugging feeling to go home immediately upon arrival. Once I get home I feel like I missed out and should also apologize to everyone for leaving.

I realize that I’m going to have no friends pretty soon, I don’t really feel any excitement for leaving the house anymore. Slowly I’m going to start to get invited to less and less, when I turn down more and more invites. 

It also sucks looking at pictures from when i loved being active and social, with no addictive tendencies. That was only a couple of years ago, which makes it hurt worse. It’s felt like 10 years.

Anyways, I feel bad for even complaining - but I haven’t had a platform to talk about my anxiety and depression freely. If you’ve been depressed before chances are you know the feeling I’m referring to. 

You don’t want to open up about your sadness because everything just feels like work. Even talking.

Anxiety,Sexual thoughts OCD (trigger warning:sexual content),"Hello, I’m a thespian who very much enjoys interacting with my fellow thespians, however, recently, I had some thoughts that have greatly triggered my ocd. You see, I (M) have developed feelings for one of my co-stars. This alone would not be bad, but it’s the recent thoughts I’ve been having that trigger me. You see, I’ve begun to have sexual thoughts about him. My ocd is telling me I shouldn’t have thoughts like that, especially about real people, and DEFINITELY not a close friend. Furthermore, how would he, a straight man, feel knowing that a gay person is thinking about him like that? Why was I okay with these immoral thoughts? All the cast photos I have with him in them have been ruined for me because of these thoughts. The worst part is, I continued thinking about these things, even though I knew they could be immoral. This isn’t due to religion or anything of the sort. As I’m a nihilist. I just firmly believe that these thoughts were wrong to have about a close, STRAIGHT, friend. What would he think if he knew? Why am I like this?"

Anxiety,"If you were to write a letter to your Anxiety or someone about your anxiety, what would you write?","Okay so I was recommended a technique of writing a letter to your mental illness. If you were to write a letter to Anxiety as if it were a real person what would you write? It’s actually a very therapeutic technique (or has been for me at least).

You could also write to a person you love who maybe doesn't understand Anxiety/mental illness too well (looking at you mum and dad) and what you wish you could say to them.

On a tangent- I started a project where I collect and publish people's ‘Letters to their mental illness’ where anybody can post letters to their illness, from eating disorders, depression, OCD etc. It’s all confidential of course.

I would love a letter from anybody here who would like to take part! Thank you for reading this!"

Anxiety,Self Esteem and Confidence at an all time low,So I’ve struggled with anxiety for a long time and I am absolutely terrified to get any treatment so I just live in this eternal nightmare. Recently my confidence has taken a huge hit and I can’t seem to get out of this hole. I graduated college recently and everyone I know seems to have gotten great jobs and are really improving in their careers. On the other hand I’m terrified to even try to get a good job. I constantly think about how well others are doing and become extremely anxious and jealous when I see my peers doing well. Even tho I have multiple qualifications that could land me a good job I just think so low of myself. I chose to get a job scrubbing toilets cause it feels like the only job I deserve to have. Anyone else ever feel this way?
Anxiety,How can I learn to trust my gut feeling again?,"I don't know if anyone else feels like this, but since my anxiety became more severe, I have been unable to trust my own gut feeling. I used to rely on it always whenever I had to make a decision and would never even question it, as I knew what I felt inside was the best for me. However, now I have this constant catastrophic scenario ready all the time. Even if I just want to travel somewhere, I have doubts about everything: what if something bad happens on the road and I can never return? This is what my gut feeling is telling me now: don't do it, something awful might happen. I am even concerned about going to uni abroad since I will be on a plane for a few hours and that gives me bad vibes. I really want to be able to trust myself again. trying to be rational at all times is exhausting, especially if it doesn't correspond with the voice in my head. Any tips on how to overcome this issue?"

First off, I just want to say how amazing it truly is to see such a hugely supportive community for anxiety. As someone who also suffers from it, it feels a lot safer knowing that I am not alone.   


I suffer from Anxiety and generalized depression, which has been the result of unresolved childhood trauma. This in turn has greatly affected my relationships and my day to day interaction with life. 

It is certainly a little nerve-wracking writing this post, especially since I don't know how it will be received.  Sorry, I am very new to Reddit, so I am still getting familiar with things here.   


Regardless, I hope that I could be a great member and friend to you all! I look forward to learning about you all and reading your stories! :)"

Tramadol is a good opioid/painkiller that is normally providing a helpful method to back pain or joint pain after any operation. And after the accident, pain turns into an unbearable condition that brings anxiety, blues, and nothing but sorrow. 

Hence, tramadol works to bring back the smile on your face and reduce all your pain."

Anxiety,Feeling anxious after a long time without it,"It began last night.

I was just chilling in bed, when I suddenly got this.. feeling. Like something was wrong. I didn't know if I was feeling sad, sentimental, happy, angry or whatever. I just felt.. weird. Different.

I tried to distract myself by reading a book, and it worked, but as soon as I put it down, the feeling was back.

In the middle of the night or early morning, I have no idea, I woke up suddenly because I thought I heard someone or something whisper my name. It freaked me the fuck out. I went through a period last year and a bit of the year before where I heard frequent whispers and saw shadows, but it thankfully went away.

When I woke up this morning, I still felt weird and like something's wrong. I took a pill to calm down, and now I'm just waiting for it to work.

I've had these anxious days before, but it's been a long time since the last one, so I'm kinda freaked out and a bit upset. I shouldn't be anxious. I'm on my meds. I have an okay life. I have nothing really upsetting going on in my life.

i hated the way people made me feel. like i was lazy, not trying hard enough, making up excuses, etc. but the thing is, it’s only me who knows what i’ve been through and knows what i can/can’t handle. i’m the one who ended up having to face the consequences of trying to please others and seem more put together than i actually was.

Anxiety,Trembling/shaking,"I developed anxiety due to getting covid earlier last year and I have been having anxiety episodes here and there.  I had trouble sleeping last summer and I was prescribed medication for almost a month (benzos, hydroxyzyne). I also took zoloft and prozac but for less than a week.  
I slowly overcame insomnia and more or less was getting back to normal.

Now starting last week I have been getting this trembling/shaking sensation in my torso/trunk and sometimes I think my whole body is trembling.  Sometimes it seems like it’s my heart beating fast but I don’t think it is.

This trembling makes sleeping specially difficult.  Because of this my sleeping heart rate average has increased (I wear a fitbit).

Has anyone here had a shaking/trembling sensation uninterrupted for a long time?

How can I know if it’s related to anxiety or if it’s something else?

Could this be a side effect of the medication I took for a short time last summer and that took months to appear?

Thank you for your comments."
Anxiety,Failed my driving test due to anxiety 4 times,"Here's a little background to understand the situation better:

I'm taking my driving test in Croatia. Going to driving school is not cheap here, if you manage to pass all the tests first time you take them, it all costs around 1000 euros, which is a lot for the Croatian standard. And each time you fail, you are obligated to pay for another three hours of driving and the test which, all together, is 100-150 euros.

I enrolled to a driving school in Zagreb, the capital, in September 2019 and i passed the theory the first time i took the tests and I did all 35 hours of driving by the end of June 2020 (took that long because of the lockdown). Now, the first two times I took the driving tests, it was in Zagreb, and then I switched to my hometown which is a lot smaller because I thought it would be much easier to pass it.

However, I failed spectacularly for another two times in my hometown.

The first time I took a test in Zagreb, I was a bit nervous but nothing to worry about, and I failed after 30 minutes of driving (the test takes 45 minutes) because I forgot to check one blind spot while driving (even though no one was there and the road was empty). But I was okay with that because I expected to fail considering that most people pass on their second time taking the test (the people who rate your driving are known for not giving the license to people on their first time because of small mistakes, to earn more money). The instructor told me I was great and that everything up until that moment of not checking the blind spot was perfect.

The second time I took the test was also in Zagreb, and I got the hardest route possible, but once again, after 30 mins I failed because I passed the sign that says I'm entering the private parking (which I did not see because I was focused on a group of people that was walking on the road).

It was then when I decided to switch to my hometown. The third time I failed again after 30 mins of driving because I, once again, lost focus. And the fourth time I failed after like 5 minutes of driving because my car turned off twice in a crossing (btw this was the first time ever that this happened to me).

The last three times I took the test, I was extremely nervous and anxious, to the point that I had to go to the bathroom after every single thing that I ate, I was throwing up before the tests, and on the day of the test I couldn't get myself to eat anything without throwing up.

My instructor told me he had nothing left to teach me, that I'm a good driver and that my problem is in my head and that I have to solve it with myself.

My fifth time taking the test is next Monday (in four days) and I have no idea what to do in order to get away from anxiety, stress and fear. I've tried everything - meditation, yoga, alcohol shots (I know, I know...but I was desperate), my parents suggested I try taking some medication but I'm afraid because I don't know how that'll effect me. Any advice?

So since nearly a week, I feel cold and I shiver a bit. I don't think I have a fever so far. My hands get really cold quickly. The heating is working well, my room is warm but I still feel cold. Even if I drink tea or eat something hot, it takes me a while to feel warm again and it doesn't last.  
I talked with some friends and they said I should see someone, my parents think it's nothing. I decided to get an appointment anyway but it's in a few hours from now and I'm scared the GP will say I'm wasting her time and that I'm too weak/whinny.

Does anyone have advice about how to cope with that?"

Please advice??"

Anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxious during the day, just because it’s daytime?","I’ve noticed that when I feel especially anxious for a few weeks, the mere fact that it’s day out can make me anxious. I know that sleeping till noon and staying up til 5 am isn’t good for me and I wanna stop but in some way I don’t. Today’s the first day in a few days I’ve gotten up earlier and I feel so unsettled that it’s still as light out as it is because light = day and day = having to be productive which = being reminded of how I should catch up on university work which I’ve been putting off for way, way too long to _ever_ get back on track, which = have no to overthink all of my decisions which = I feel like I’m gonna have a panic attack just writing this out.

Anxiety,I think that quarantine worsened my crippling anxiety. Help.,"If I'm being completely honest, I don't know if ""crippling anxiety"" even is the right term to what I'm facing but it seems to be the closest definition from what I gathered.  

Basically, before quarantine, I had some illogical fears that would genuinely stop me from doing ""normal people things"" such as plugging something like a charger. Weird. I know. But, so far, that was all I really faced.

Then boom: quarantine. I find that I'm paranoid over almost everything. From catching covid-19, getting a random heart attack or stroke (when i start thinking these things my heart beats faster, i get light headed, and i sweat and it makes me even more panicked rip), eating something then choking (to the point where I just don't eat meat), dying in a car crash (i refuse to go outside sometimes even id i've been isolated for months just because of this), and getting blown up by a random bomb or a gasleak.

I really hate how this is fucking up my mindset and obstructing me from things that I should be able to do. I live with my family and I feel like such a nuisance because of all the things I can't do because of my anxiety. 

Does anyone have any tips to combat these issues? Can someone tell me that it's goimg to be ok and none of the crazy bullshit my mimd is saying is true? Fuck I just need some reassurance. Any at all will be appreciated.

Anxiety,Guilt over job anxiety,"So I am in a lucky position where I work part time. I work for a small medical practice. I’ve been there for over three years, I’m a receptionist.

I used to enjoy the job. It was simple enough, and my boss is insanely nice. However I’ve started to hate it. For one, I feel I’ve outgrown the work, I don’t enjoy it at all. Then other things include getting wayyy busier during the pandemic, changing systems in the middle of this all and having to learn it, and my boss is an insanely anxious person. For the first time ever he yelled at me, but he apologized profusely after. He always compliments me on how I handle his emotions well. The truth is him being constantly stressed out is getting to me. He even comes to me to talk about money problems with the practice.

I feel guilty though. Despite my boss being stressed, he is extremely kind and cares and I know that’s rare. Also, it’s only part time! The day before my shifts it’s all I can think about now. After work too I’m always sooo tired because with Covid and the new system plus being busier, I feel like I’m drowning there constantly. I’m ashamed that I struggle so much with only a couple of days a week and with a kind boss, I should be grateful.

I’m in therapy, take medication, work out constantly and eat well. I’m doing everything I can but I don’t know how to handle this work anxiety and also the guilt that comes with it."

So she was seeing them and deleting them for me and I was there too, I got a lot of mixed feelings. I don't have feelings for my best friend, but that night I cuddled her and I kissed her cheek and it was really really weird. I felt like I crossed a huge line. And I would not have kissed her I am sure of that. But now things are different. Now I don't think she's ever going to see me as the same person. And she won't talk to me for sure. I talked to her and she's disappointed because of all her friends I was the one that never hit on her. Now I don't know what to do. I can't afford lose people anymore. I'm feeling guilty as hell.

Anxiety,Tips for dealing with bad anxiety over something stupid I have previously done?,"Hi,

I'm honestly not sure whether this would be considered anxiety, but for about a week I have been suffering frequent intrusive thoughts about something incredibly stupid that I did several years ago - these thoughts leave me feeling tight chested and mentally distracted/overwhelmed which affect my ability to perform at work.

Several years ago I travelled around Thailand and at some point visited an establishment that sold magic mushrooms and I stupidly tried them in a smoothie. Whilst the mushrooms ultimately had essentially no hallucinogenic effects on me I have recently been afflicted with tremendous anxiety over the thought of me being caught at the time of me taking them and how stupid and useless I am for taking them. This is obviously compounded by Thailand punishing drug users severely and the prisons are some of the worst in the world. It goes without saying that I know that taking them was a ridiculous thing to do and I regretted it as soon as I sobered up and I'll never take them again - in fact I wouldn't have normally taken them but at the time I had intended to commit suicide during my stay there but decided against it obviously.

Does anyone have any tips for getting rid of anxiety over past mistakes? These have only started occurring recently (several years after I did it) I try using CBT reasoning but I feel it isn't effective. Many thanks in advance."

Anxiety,Birth control to treat hormones that induce anxiety?,"I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2019 and have since been on Lexamil. It kept losing effectiveness and we kept increasing the dosage.

We have started to consider my hormones and I am going to see a gynecologist soon to take a look at that as well.

however i was still really anxious on the way to my workplace and i continued crying about what was gonna happen later. i work at an enrichment centre and teach young kids and today i had to teach half a lesson. it is my first time teaching a class. i was really afraid of screwing up so i kept panicking.

when i reached my workplace i was told that i would be teaching 2 full lessons instead. i was scared but the first lesson went smoothly, and i felt more confident for the second lesson. i was given some feedback and i still have things i need to work on, but i feel much better.

i have two more lessons to teach tomorrow, then four lessons back to back on saturday. i am a little worried for saturday, but i will try to stay strong.

Anxiety,Another med thing,"I have a really bad 'spiraling' issue so I have been told by my therapist. I'm on 3 different meds and 1 as needed... none of them help me with this problem so I spiral down and down into the 'what ifs' of every situation to a point where I can't feel a 'gut feeling' or make a choice. 

Lamictal, Wellbutrin, Seroquel and as needed is Klonopin. None of these have helped the anxiety much, if at all. Just the depression/moods. 

Did anyone find a med that helped them with the spiraling issue..? Of course I know every med effects everyone differently. I'm just wondering if anyone found anything useful or if the spiraling thing is just untreatable by meds. 

(Yes I'm in therapy, don't recommend that to me please). I can't take SSRI/NSRIs either. They fuck me up really bad mentally and make things only worse and worse.

Anxiety,Switching careers... excitement has now become imposter syndrome. Am I making a mistake?,"Switching careers... excitement has now turned into imposter syndrome!

Hi friends,

I am currently a graduate student in an architecture program, but years of unhappy internships (I’ve ranted so much on this site) filled with anxiety and depression, I finally am deciding to branch out. I have been meeting with people to go more into Development and taking a finance boot camp online, and I was so thrilled and excited for a change. Suddenly imposter syndrome is settling in, as there is SO much business terminology, formulas, and strategy that I just simply do not know. I’ve never even taken a business class in college until this upcoming spring that I enrolled in. It’s very overwhelming. What if I don’t understand finance enough if I do get an internship? I’m practically being self-taught, so what if I’m all wrong? I’m a fish out of water now and I feel scared. I don’t regret leaving architecture but my anxiety is leaving me with “what if I fail and regret this” moments. I’m trying my best and studying several hours a day, but what if when it comes to real world applications I just fail?

Any advice or support is greatly appreciated. I’m just trying to be happy finally. Thank you."
Anxiety,Medical/health anxiety,"This past November I went to the ER with acute appendicitis. Surgery went well but the new antibiotic they put me on (as I'm allergic to almost all of them) gave me an allergic reaction too. It's under control and nothing serious happened as a result, and it sounds silly but ever since then Ive had this anxiety that I'm on death's door. That I could get sick at any moment and not be able to take antibiotics for it, that or they'll keep experimenting new ones on me til one of them kills me. I've had a chest cold the last few days and confirmed it was not covid, but now I'm afraid to go to the dr about it, as I'm afraid they'll shrug it off, tell me to rest, or give me antibiotics that end up killing me. 

Now I have this weird anxiety that something worse is wrong. Like cancer or something. I have no basis for this, except a few aches and pains in my abdomen, that and my anxiety, but I'm worried something is wrong. I know the best thing to do is go to the dr and express my concerns but I have a history of the doctors shrugging things off, telling me im overreacting or that there's no basis for my concerns so they cant do any scans. In the past, I expressed concern that I might have ovarian cysts or cancer, or something I wasnt sure of. I just had a gut feeling something was wrong down there and for years doctors shrugged it off until I FINALLY found a doctor who believed my concern was real and she did a scan and found that I have an abnormal uterus. Nothing serious but it could explain my bad periods. That doctor said she was impressed I could have a gut feeling about something with virtually no symptoms and commended me on my persistence when I knew something wasnt right with my body. I wish I could still go to this doctor but I'm in a different city now.

Now i have that gut feeling again and idk if it's because something actually is wrong and I have a knack for knowing these things, or if I'm just anxious about the possibility of being so sick. Regardless, how can I go into a doctors office and say ""I have a feeling that I might have a serious illness and the only way to calm myself down is if you scan my entire body to make sure"". Doctors dont go for that. And then it has me wondering if I'm a hypochondriac which makes me feel even more invalidated. 

Has anyone else experienced this and have any advice on keeping myself sane? Right now I feel like it's as I've already gotten a terminal diagnosis and I cant focus on anything else in my life though I shouldnt have any reason to believe something is wrong."

At night I have attacks because I feel that at any moment my existence will be shut off like a television set. Immediately discontinued as if the power is shut off. I have two awesome kids and an amazing wife. I'm thrilled and otherwise happy about it. But the thought that at any moment it will end really gets to me. Are there any techniques I could use to try and sleep better? My sons are 5 and 3 and I really want to be around for them to grow up, but my brain keeps convincing me that I won't make it much longer. Normally when trying to sleep I think about it and breathing gets rapid, chest hurts and I get overwhelmed with a feeling of dread. My job doesn't help. I work at a truck stop that caters to very angry truck drivers constantly. I'm a relatively normal bearded fellow. I'm not like, afraid of the truck drivers but they always seem to say things that mess with me. Any advice would be awesome. I'd love a good night's rest."

stuck, scared, and having horrible thoughts.

maybe i can put on a show, then try and focus on it for a while. 

this is the third time i’ve woken up last night/today
i’m sleepy and i wish i could just be asleep! 

just waiting to clam down now

i always get set off by thoughts. i lose control almost and it spirals into an attack. i think.

i don’t like this. i don’t like thinking these things especially the thoughts of i’m not enough and that the people in my life don’t want me around.
it’s almost like i know it’s not true... or it can’t be true... but i still believe it and think it... and it feels like that’s anxiety. i’m always scared of those things and it’s caused me to not have good relationships because i’m always in fear of the person leaving me for another or deserting me. i don’t have a relationship with many people family, friends... also with boyfriends i struggle. i have a boyfriend how’s very kind to me but i’m in constant fear he’s going to leave or cheat.

i have been to see counselors and what i’ve boiled down to be is that my past/current relationships with family and boyfriends caused anxiety. my ex was pretty bad to me and we lived together for 4 years and he manipulated/gaslighted me the last year of our relationship and was also sleeping with someone else.
i was called crazy by my boyfriends family and shut out by all of them because i got so upset and tried to protect myself from his shit. 
in the past my mom had also “left”. she went always for 2 years for school and i thought she was coming back but then she moved for her boyfriend to hawaii. we were living apart for 4 years, all of my high school.
in addition to what seems like attachment anxiety, i have anxiety in general... although it can revolve heavily around the fear that i’m not/never will be enough and the fear of being deserted, lied to, or left for another by my partner or even a family member(although not as much family because i’m not in contact with them much).

7 years have passed since all that with my mom but we still don’t have a relationship and i live far from my dad who i see once every two years. i’m 25 now but i feel as i’ve gotten older i realized i’ve always had anxiety and it could have just flared up because of all of this. 
the thing that sucks is that it’s been getting worse, and worse, and worse in the last 5 years to where it’s affected almost every aspect of my life.

i start a really important internship in two weeks and i will be graduating in 6 months and moving into the professional world. 
i’m scared as hell that i’m not going to make it in this world professionally because of all the anxiety i hold everyday. i am also scared i’ll never be able to be happy in a relationship because i’ll always fear them leaving for another."

I also can't reminisce about my wedding without thinking about all of my missteps, feeling embarrassed about getting tipsy, etc.  In your experience, has Lexapro helped with this?

Anxiety,Questions about anxiety,"Is it normal to have physical anxiety symptoms without feeling anxious mentally?
For example I was driving to work this morning running behind and had heart palpitations, although mentally I felt okay, possibly a little stressed.

During the day while I’m busy at work I usually have no issues besides worrying of death/fear of issues I may develop as I have some minor health issues.
(Thoughts of me dying young plague my mind more often than I feel they should)

At night I often see my heart beating and have heart palpitations once I get settled in at home, which results in me mentally feeling very strong feelings of what I believe is anxiety.

Two nights ago while I was in bed my heart palpitations started, in addition to me feeling cold and having shakes in my legs that I could not stop or control.

Does this sound like an anxiety issue?

At the same time I know that in order to make a good living and do something productive with my future I need to take these classes. I've though about it some and I believe that the reason I feel this way is because I've grown being surrounded by friends and family members who are all super smart and work hard jobs.

Anxiety,Choking/swallowing anxiety,"It all started around a year ago when I was eating something and I noticed I would go to swallow and I couldn’t. The first time it happened I ofc was nervous but a while later it went away. It would happen out-of-the-blue every few months. I notice sometimes under stress it is more likely to happen. Now it happens at least a few times a week. I’m afraid I will choke and I go to swallow and I can’t swallow which makes me panic and I eventually swallow. But the food is all the way back ready so there is that potential to choke when I can’t swallow. It is worse now that I am living alone and idk what I would do if I actually choke. I just want to stop this anxiety because it is unnecessary and actually ironically makes me more likely to choke. I think the anxiety actually tightens my throat muscles temporarily which causes that delayed inability to swallow. The more aware of this issue I am the more it seems to happen. I think the fact that all of the hospitals are way over capacity, and a lot of deaths where I live is making the anxiety worse because if I need help for choking I may not get help in time...

Anxiety,I’m proud of myself ❤️,Today in my course we were discussing the events of yesterday (I live in the USA) and this whole situation has given me big anxiety and worry. My teacher said that we could ask him privately if we didn’t feel comfortable discussing everything right now and Im proud of myself for advocating for myself and privately messaging that I didn’t want to discuss right now. He let me work on some independent things. Just wanted to share as I’m proud of myself for being able to step away. Hope this is okay to post here. ❤️
Anxiety,How to calm yourself down after anxiety?,.
Anxiety,"Panic attacks at night , diet?",I have been a vegetarian for 12 years and recently stopped and started eating meat again. I have always had some level of anxiety but nothing really serious until now... in the past month I have been waking up in the middle of the night with heart palpitations that make me really anxious and I can’t go back to sleep because I get scared. I have been eating some snacks before going to bed and stuff but I used to be able to do this without having attacks in the middle of the night. I did a blood test and everything came out alright... should I just stop eating snacks at night? Is my body adjusting to a new diet? Anyone else have this? Are there any foods that trigger your anxiety that you a void at all costs?
Anxiety,Depression and Anxiety in the Black Community," **Hey man, say man. If you grew up in a black household the idea of mental health as an issue probably didn't exist. Instead of dealing with problems professionally, rhetoric involving prayer or picking yourself up was probably hurled at you like a fastball from Randy Johnson. It's ok. You're not alone, and some people will never try to understand what you're feeling. Shit, it's tough for me to explain to my parents the impact certain mental health situations have had on my life and different decisions I've made.** [https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2021/1/6/year-1-of-covid-19-life-takeaways](https://4ormypeople.com/flava/2021/1/6/year-1-of-covid-19-life-takeaways)"
Anxiety,I got a job offer and am freaking out because of it.,"Hey there.

I'm currently studying at university and working part time. 

Today my former boss called me and offered me a job that got scratched last year due to covid. Last year it was my absolut dream job - paid really well, interesting field and also close to the profession I want to work in after graduation. 

But now all I'm just scared and feel bad thinking about leaving my current job (nice colleagues, close to my apartment, decently paid, not in my future field of work). Everyone tells me that it would be a good opportunity - and they're right, it is. I know that. But I'm just so overwhelmed, just thinking about it makes me want to cry.

I guess I'm just scared of change but maybe some of you can relate or give a little advice."
Anxiety,I am worrying for an hypothetical scenario of my ocd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I worry that I may have broken a promise to Gods in which I may have asked for a specific, bad punishment in case breaking it. I cant remember making the promise but I get bad feelings as if there are chances that I may have made one.

I am worrying for the punishment. I do not want it. Its an invisible punishment. I will give you a similar example (maybe).

Someone who has ocd, is being bugged by his ocd to watch a youtube video as a compulsion. He does not want to do it. He wants to say no to his ocd but he cant ignore it. So, he makes a promise to Gods not to see a video from youtube and asks to become bald but without being able to see the baldness. He makes the promise and asks for that scary punishment in order to force himself not to do the compulsion. He uses the fear of the punishment to fight his ocd. He does not want to make the promise but he is forced to.

He watches a picture from that video and worries that he may have be punished by becoming bald. He looks in the mirror but he cant see the baldness. He sees his usual hair. All other see that he is bald. I do not want to analyze it more because it triggers my ocd.

What if there are Gods (in case Christian God is not real) that do not care about my ocd and accept the promise?

The thing is that I CANT REMEMBER MAKING SUCH A PROMISE. I just, have a bad feeling coming from it AS IF there are chances that I made one. I think, the reason I worry so much is because for many months, I was having that bad feeling. So, having that bad feeling and being something like ""maybe there is a promise, I better avoid it"" for many months, made me believe that I may have made a promise. The question is why that feeling exists? Probably, because I had some random. intrusive thoughts about it and that created the bad feeling. So as time passed by, I forgot the intrusive thoughts (because they were random, uncontrolled thoughts) but the bad feeling remained. So, bad feeling and an hypothesis for many months, made the worry bigger."
Anxiety,irrational overwhelming thoughts,"i have had anxiety since i was 13 and am now 22. lately i have been having really intrusive thoughts and i’m not sure how to control them? I used to take prozac and wellbutrin but went off May 2020 because my husband and I are trying for a baby. I have been generally happy and we’ve been great. There is no “real” reason so for me to have these constant worries. i have periodically have had these thoughts in the past but the last month or so they have gotten horrible. my thoughts consist of fears, deaths, loss, cheating(not me on my hub but my hub on me), and overall bad feelings. my husband is amazing and i trust that these are just my internalize fears coming forward. i used to see a therapist but we moved out of state Nov. 2019 so i haven’t in a while and really don’t want to get a new one at this point. 
does anyone experience this too or know any ways i could calm myself down when i get in episodes?"
Anxiety,Anxious that I won’t go to sleep. Getting dissociated and processing things slowly. I feel like I’ve lost myself.,"Last January I got a depersonalization episode unlike any other. I got super anxious, slept over at a friend house, got racing images/thoughts that disturbed me when I closed my eyes (I think it might be ocd since I also have that but not sure), and just could not go to sleep. I was extremely panicked. The insomnia lasted over 2 weeks. 

The other night, I was wide awake at my bff’s house. I was not sober but rarely get drunk/do drugs so i was just excited. But my friend is used to doing those things occasionally so she was ready for sleep. I wasn’t and was suddenly afraid I won’t sleep. So I got really really anxious, got flashing disturbing images again (even scarier than last year), and didn’t sleep.

The next morning (yesterday) she gave me half a Xanax and I slept for 6 hours (but I grinded my teeth rly bad which I never do). Fast forward to the next day (this morning), I have still been unable to sleep due to anxiety and fear of ending up like last year.

I am now dissociated and feel really different and change makes me really scared (the state of America rn is making it worse), I feel like I don’t make sense when I speak, that I process words slowly, and have brain damage or something went wrong with me.

I don’t feel tired at all and that worries me. My best friend is sound asleep next to me and I wish I was doing the same. I now feel really unstable and unsure of myself and feel like I’m gonna have chronic insomnia or sleep disturbances and that it won’t resolve this time. That I’ll have to rely on medication forever and have organ damage or sleepwalk and do something bad in my sleep from the sleep aids due to sleepwalking etc. so many anxieties and I can’t stop them.

I’m really scared I’ll forget how to sleep or something. I don’t know how to stop these thoughts and I just feel so different. I hate feeling like I don’t know myself or what I should really be feeling or how to feel calm and I’m scared. I just really need reassurance and support and hopefully someone that relates and has a remedy for being so irrational 😞"
Anxiety,should i ask my doctor about medication?,"cw just in case: talk of physical symptoms of anxiety, panic, derealization/dissociation 

i’m a minor (almost 16) my parents are really against medication for mental health stuff as far is i know, but in the past year my anxiety has gotten really bad and really physical. like i constantly feel like there’s this tightness and extremely heavy weight like crushing my chest and it makes it hard to breathe. i’m also really tense all the time which makes me ache all the time and i’m also having some other symptoms that i think are related but might not be. (like if you touch me or i lean against a corner or smth i can feel it hurting for like 15+ minutes after (i also have rlly bad acid reflux to the point where my dad is like “you’re gonna get an ulcer” )) 

i’ve also just started panicking randomly like 3 times a day at least in the past week or so and it’s getting worse and worse and it’s very hard to deal with. like i’ll be brushing my teeth or sitting in class and it’ll just hit me and i won’t be able to breathe. 

i’m also having issues sleeping again and i’ve gotten so irritable because i’m so anxious all the time and i know people hate being around me sometimes because of it and i feel bad but i can’t stop it. 

my anxiety has also contributed to my derealization issues, i tend to check out and go into a dissociative state a lot because it’s gotten so bad which is hard because i’m in school and such. 

idk my parents probably wouldn’t like the idea but i can’t keep living with the physical symptoms of it, and trying to fix all the symptoms of it doesn’t ever work because it doesn’t help the root of it and the root just keeps growing and getting worse. i also don’t know who my doctor is because my last one just left the practice that i go to so i’ve never met her. 

idk i just need advice and like,,, if i do ask about it how would i go about that? like what do i say?

TLDR: the worsening physical symptoms and consequences of my anxiety are making my life really hard and just really painful and i don’t know if i should ask my doctor about medication because she’s a new doctor to me and my parents have always been against medication for mental illness"
Anxiety,"It's probably anxiety, however I only have social anxiety so I'm not sure. Either way, how do I stop feeling anxious 24/7?","It's the same feeling as butterflies in your stomach or that feeling right before you present something that you expected to have more time to work on. Like a cross between dread and fear. But it's been CONSTANT for almost a week, whereas I'm used to it coming in waves and only when there's social stuff going on. 

It's been killing my appetite, it makes me gag when I eat or brush teeth, I can't sleep properly, and it's probably Making me act skittish with my friends. I have tests coming up soon too so I'm sorta desperate to feel better... even if it's temporary 

Does anyone have any coping tips? Anything that works well you for? I'll try almost anything"
Anxiety,Chest tight for five days now :(,"Hi everyone, first post on this sub. 

I just started back work on Monday from over a week and half break off work. Starting this past Sunday I started having really bad chest tightness, on Sunday to the point I thought I was having a heart attack. It's continued all week. I was prescribed Vistaril by an urgent care doctor, which helped me sleep, however has caused me horrible nightmares. 

I am on day 5 of chest tightness, it's gotten a little better but still there :/ 

I'm normally an anxious person but I've been relaxing and this tightness came out of nowhere. I've never really had my anxiety manifest itself physically until once earlier this year and now.

Anybody have any solutions? I've been trying to sleep it off and do breathing exercises to no avail. I'm going to a NP on Monday to discuss my issues but this is incredibly distracting and I'm having a hard time at work."
Anxiety,Anxiety search,So I deal with anxiety everyday from when I wake up til I go to sleep. I have mostly health anxiety and been to expensive ER trips and I’m perfectly healthy. Once in a while I’m calm and not thinking about anything. Out of nowhere my body gets anxious and It starts looking for pains to make me worry that somethings wrong. Does this happen to anyone else?
Anxiety,Anyone successfully tapered off Paxil or Effexor using the Prozac Bridge?,... if so I’d love your story ♥️
Anxiety,I just need to vent...,My anxiety has been a little worse lately. I cried on the phone to my mom for about 20 minutes because I have been so stressed about finding a house lately and I missed 2 house showings last night due to traffic. All I can think about is getting a house so I’m constantly looking all over for a place and checking my email
Anxiety,intrusive thoughts?,i keep having intrusive thoughts especially in the morning and like i don’t know how to get rid of them but they cause me so much anxiety and i don’t know what to do about it. like i woke up this morning convinced all my friends were dead and i don’t know how to make those thoughts go away does anybody have any tips?
Anxiety,my anxiety is getting bad again and im scared,i have ocd &amp; anxiety and i worked so hard to get to such a good place and now i feel like it's crumbling again. bullied a ton this week and trying to cope with that. not to mention having cramps too. I'm scared of everything and i don't really know what to do.
Anxiety,If only I had found this website earlier on...,"Hello everyone, I’m fairly new here so be patient if you all know about this website, but I found it so helpful I wanted to share. I discovered it recently, but had I found out earlier it would have helped understand my symptoms so much! It’s one of the very few useful Google searches I made during my many hypochondriacal moments. 

Here is the link: https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety-guide/symptoms"
Anxiety,It's just paralysing when it happens,[removed]
Anxiety,"I want a successful career and a nice, normal life but anxiety makes it nearly impossible.","I don't want to go on about this for a long time but here's a few interactions that most people would feel normal about but I have to find the courage (and usually fail) to do so. 

- Ask for help or answer a question in class. I feel really awkward asking the teacher to repeat what they just said and I think that people judge me for it. I can never do this because I worry so much about what other people think, I'd probably start sweating uncontrollably and then I'd worry about that. The result is that it generates a snowball effect. Not asking for help has really hindered my performance in maths class (The subject I find the hardest) especially online class because our final grade is also judged on how much we participate in answering questions and stuff. 


- My friend has recently got a good job that stemmed from making small talk with a random stranger he met in a line. It occurred to me that some of the best opportunities you get in life are based on luck. E.G: Talking to a stranger who in turn offered him a job opportunity with great benefits. I could never even dream of talking with a stranger that I did not need to. 


- a few months ago I had to do work experience in customer service. Luckily the place was pretty quiet and the most I had to do was push a button. However, during the interview, I was so visibly nervous the guy interviewing me asked if I was okay and if I needed a minute. 


This isn't really a career hindrance, just something I suffer terribly from: 

- I refuse to eat in front of anyone. I remember this one time my crush invited me out to eat with her and her sister and I will never live down or forget how embarrassing and awkward I acted. I think that really exacerbated this problem. Probably didn't help my chances with her either. 

Even now I'm reading through this over and over to see if I sound like a complete fool 😂 I guess you can judge."
Anxiety,Anyone else get anxiety about your goals/plans for the future?,"Ironically, I'm currently unemployed due to burnout as I'd quit my job a few months ago. Been recovering and so I made a list of goals I'd like to achieve this year. I'm also sort of going through a break up situation that is making me more depressed. Being isolated doesn't help either as my family lives in another country and I'm basically living alone in another city where I've got no friends. Basically it's hard! 

I get major anxiety thinking and planning my goals that sometimes I end up depressed because I feel like I may never be able to achieve them. Hearing or watching other people achieve the things I could have with the time I have wasted makes me more anxious and depressed. I have multiple goals which makes it very difficult for me to concentrate on one and gives me truck loads of anxiety everytime I think about it. It definitely motivates me but it also increases my anxiety. 

I really want to be able to achieve the goals I have set for myself but my anxiety and perfectionistic tendencies can get in the way sometimes. Often leading to no productive work being done and time wasted. 

What can I do to help myself?"
Anxiety,Panic attack in a Uber..,Anybody ever been through this?
Anxiety,i have an extreme phobia of doctors and i have to get a TB test for my new job tomorrow. i need some kind words and encouragement.,"title pretty much says it all. my doctor phobia is so extreme i've passed out, ran out of the room, thrown up, and have even checked out of hospitals AMA. i HAVE to get a TB test for work tomorrow at 1 and i'm really starting to freak out. i think i'm going to just blindfold myself and blast music in my headphones and ask them to tap me on the shoulder once it's over. i also have a really bad sensory aversion to having my arms touched, which is the root of my phobia tbh. idk, i'm starting to spiral just thinking about it."
Anxiety,how much help medication in anxiety treatment?,please share your thoughts with us
Anxiety,How can I help my girlfriend?,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 years and she is my world. She has always had slight anxiety but nothing that I could ever really see. She is in her last year of college and has a lot riding on her grades. She plans to go on to further education and needs to do well to ensure that. She always has been stressed about tests in the past but could get over it. About three months ago she was stressed out and had a health scare that I think triggered her current state. Since then she is always worried about her health and extremely stressed. She checks her heart rate constantly and just feels groggy. In the last week with finals upon us she is in an awful place. She can barely study with out feeling like she will pass out or thinking she is having a heart attack. She is at her breaking point and I’m not sure how much longer she can feet going. It’s so hard for me to watch because there is little I can do to help. Here is what I have tried some more successful than others: Just talk to her and reassure her it’s all okay, talk about different topics and try to distract her, get her a heart rate tracker to show her it’s all okay, make her a bath to relax, do meditation with her, offer help for anything she needs, listen to “anxiety relief” sound tracks, and just hold her and say nothing trying to comfort her. They work a little but in the last few days her anxiety has gone from making her unable to do anything for a hour or less to now it’s all day long. She is scared and tells me she knows it’s just anxiety but she can’t stop thinking she is having health problems. She says she doesn’t want to feel this way anymore and is so sick of it. We have talked about going to see someone and she doesn’t want to take medicine and feels bogged down, and doesn’t want to talk to someone about her feelings. I don’t think she would budge on the medication but if she went to see someone and they advised it I think she would maybe talk to someone. I’m sorry if this is breaking any rules or just be rabbling but I’m lost at what else I can do to help. I love her and want her to feel better and just thought you all could help me do so and make her be in a better place. Thank you in advance, if there are any questions or you need more info just comment and ask and I’ll provide. I hope I can figure something out soon ):"
Anxiety,How do I help someone who constantly overthinks?,"I (18, F) am really worried about my boyfriend (18) since he's been overthinking a lot. For example, I helped him come up with an idea for an essay of his, and although he appreciated the help, he couldn't help but feel guilty and worried about someone thinking he was plagiarising. He describes that it feels like someone is constantly out to get him, and that he needs to be on eggshells around others to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone (even though he's genuinely a great person). He feels that he overthinks a lot, and doesn't like that he cares so much about what other people think of him, as he's been feeling like this for a really long time now. At first I thought it was just anxiety which would arise from certain situations, but he's been feeling like this much more often and I can tell it's bringing him down. He's had therapy before and it worked for him, as he told me he is currently in a healthy state, but seeing him like this makes me feel like he might need to go back to therapy or see a professional about it, since his paranoia is impacting his daily life. I've suggested that he should try going to our college's counselling service, but I'm not sure where to go from there. Any advice I could give him to help him ease his anxiety/paranoia? Or is there anything you think I should do which might help? If any of you have any thought exercises he could do or something like that I would really appreciate it! (Or even redirect me to a more suitable subreddit, whichever works). :-))"
Anxiety,"Help, how do I calm down","I have an important decision to make, whether to go on a trip to Mexico in 8 days or not to joint my boyfriend that I haven't seen in a year

But no choice seems good

Going just seems incredibly stressful, taking the tain, getting to the airport, having to change flights at said airport, all while hoping no one's going to stop me bc of covid. I'm also incredibly busy with school and idk how to plan the trip on top of that


However the thought of not being able to see my boyfriend for 6 more months makes me want to die. The bare thought of that possibility has been making me cry and cry and cry for days

Help"
Anxiety,I was my hands for close to the number of hours I sleep every day,"**Could be triggering for OCD sufferers**

I haven’t been diagnosed but I know I have some sort of OCD/anxiety issue and I need to release my thoughts somewhere.

I’ve been spiralling the past few months and it’s gotten to the point where I wash my hands for basically the same amount I sleep in one day.

Today I got home from work at 6:30.. I took an hour long shower, cleaned my bathroom until 9, washed my hands for half an hour, then washed my hands for like an hour before eating, washed my hands for an hour before bed, and every time I use the toilet I wash my hands for 15-30 minutes each time.

I don’t know why but every tiny thing that COULD be wrong I just HAVE to wash my hands and I can’t not. For example I will urinate. I’d imagine splashes hitting my arm so in the sink I’ll wash my entire arm. But then I realize I didn’t wash my hands with soap before washing my arm so maybe I got germs on my arm! So I’ll wash my hands with soap. Then rewash my arm. Oh but then I accidentally brush the faucet with the “dirty” hands that just washed my arm. And then I’ll have to wash my hands, wash the faucet, wash my hands again, but then accidentally get a splash on my lip. The water’s probably clean.... but I imagine me eating later, the food touching my lip, making me eat “dirty” water.. and so I wash my hands AGAIN to make them extra clean, wash my mouth, wash my hands again because my mouth was dirty....... and if it ends here it’s best case scenario. I usually have to rewash 3-5 times because I got the “routine” wrong and it’s draining me.

The thoughts swirl around my head so I distract myself with my phone until exhaustion and I usually fall asleep around 4-5 a.m. and wake up at 9 for work the next morning...

I can’t live like this."
Anxiety,I feel so overwhelmed,Even though I am a nobody. I feel so alone that it overwhelms me. I just want to scream I don’t know what to do
Anxiety,MY DOCTOR WONT GIVE ME BENZOs,HOW DO I GE THIM TO!?!? I ABUSED THE LAST SCRIPT AND HE WONT GIVE ME A 2nd CHANCE :(
Anxiety,Planning for the future causing existential dread,"Everytime I think about the future, even if it is anticipation for good things, I always am filled with dread and anxiety. I think about how good moments never last very long in my life. I also think about death. Whenever I envision my future, it automatically causes me to think about dying which is very unsettling. This can cause me to spiral into a depression or an anxiety attack. Anyone else have this problem?"
Anxiety,I think it's time.,"I know my anxiety triggers.. I work in healthcare and see what infectious diseases can do to people. 

What a time to have a career in this field. 

I'm not just talking about Covid-19.. although, my anxiety related to communicable diseases has definitely increased this year. It's other things as well.. HPV. Hepatitis C. 

Yes, I wear gloves and the required PPE for contact rooms.

But what if my jacket brushes up against something in a room that doesn't require head to toe covering? Even if the surface looks clean, what it's there? 

I have chlorhexidine 4% in my shower.. they sell it at Walgreens. 

I think if I get away from my current work position, this anxiety will decrease.. or will it just transfer to another focus? 

I don't know. 

But I need to do something."
Anxiety,When your family triggers you.,"I have have only newly realized I have anxiety. It didn’t take me too long to see my family triggers it, a lot. More specifically my Older brother and my Dad. I could make a whole post about these assholes, but I think that sums it up pretty well. 
My older brother (30) has issues being the forgotten first born after me and my younger brother came along. And my dad (igaf old) didn’t have a dad growing up so whatever baggage comes from that.  I have already established I don’t like my older brother in our family and they understandably don’t say anything about it because we are all frankly sick of him. I never thought I’d have to condemn someone else to those kind of feelings of hate that I have, but recently I’ve begun to realize my dad gives me the same shitty feeling my brother does and I’m sick of it. I’m tired of just taking it because I want to keep the peace. I am never at peace around these people because they can’t help but be assholes. I’ve told him to stop before and he takes it as a joke. Well I’m tired of it. And I’m tired of the peace. I feel like I can’t be around my own house because my heart is racing the whole time so I’m locked in my room for HOURS!"
Anxiety,The big day; getting my license.,"I’m freshly 29 and just now learning to drive. I’ve been a passenger in a few car accidents in my life that have left me with severe driving anxiety and ptsd. 3 years ago the car I was in was hit by a semi truck changing lanes, and being on the road is an incredibly hard place for me to be at times. I’ve been serious about learning to drive since August of this year (off and on) and now the big day is coming in less than two days. I don’t feel ready, and my anxiety monster’s presence is very much alive. Recently my driving anxiety nervousness has caused me to blank out on the most simple of things like the difference between Left and Right when I’m being told to make a turn. I freakin’ know my left and right. It’s so frustrating. I’m concerned that during my driving test I’m going to get them mixed up again and fail due to it. I’ve also been alternating between 3 cars that I’ve been learning in and the car I have to take the test with I’m less familiar with and have spent less time in, so I’m not used to the breaking and acceleration in it. I’m nervous. I’m anxious. I know it’s not the end of the world if I don’t pass the first time, but I know it will validate how I feel about myself not being a good driver or ready and it’s going to make the next test harder. I’ve been studying for the written for weeks and tonight I was doing a practice test and messing up a lot, so now I’m feeling less confident. I have my last driving lesson tomorrow (the day before the test) through the driving school I’ve been going to, so I’m hoping it will help. I’ve been doing some cbt therapy methods for driving anxiety from videos I found on YouTube (the Generation Calm channel is amazing). But I’m not quite ~there~ yet. 

Thank you for listening to me vent and please wish me luck! And maybe even pray for me if you’re into that kind of thing. I’ll come back with an update. &lt;3"
Anxiety,Can’t catch a break,"I’m so anxious right now I need to lie down but whichever way I do I’m feeling so nauseous and like I can’t breathe.

I’m so tired of this I just want some relief. If it’s not the buzzing anxiety it’s the crushing emptiness which also knocks the wind out of me."
Anxiety,Fear,"Had my first ever few panic attacks two weeks ago, felt like I was dying etc, first started with a brain zap and then panic, and then the worst happened before bed which really messed me up, most times I was able to bring myself under control fairly quickly in terms of rapid heart etc but it was the overriding fear that's hung around. The following week I had what felt like a panic attack hangover. Restlessness, chest plunging sensations of dread, chest tightness, sharp pains over my chest, prickly tingling feelings in my hand, and eventually they subsided.

I'm a regular road cyclist, so I've been out as usual, and my fitness is as good as it was, no issues at all.

Whilst the chest plunging feelings eventually dulled in pull (I'd like it to going over a sharp hump back bridge), I've been left with this feeling of fear, every odd sensation I experience almost drags me back into that panic. Sometimes when I'm on the edge of that, even reading about these things edge's me out closer. 

It feels like I've terrified myself and I can't get over the fear of it. I'm not usually one to worry myself, but it's an automatic reaction every time I feel a minor pain in my head or tightness, or odd sensation

How do you get over that and break the chain reaction?"
Anxiety,"I just talked 2 minutes and 50 seconds in front of class. It was a practise speech about a random topic. I was visibly shaking the whole time and had looong pauses, before I could remember what to continue with, but here I am, fucking alive!","Big thanks to this community for letting me see a lot of other people struggle with this. Also, I don't feel like my anxiety gets any better with each task like this, but I am learning to live with it. Have a beautiful day"
Anxiety,I’m so close to not submitting a presentation cause I just can’t get it right!,"I’m so anxious, I hate these presentations. I thought it would be easier since we just record ourselves, but we’re timed, it’s due in a few hours and although I have my work, I’m feeling so anxious. I keep stuttering in the practice videos and I don’t think i know what I’m saying anymore. At this point I’d rather fail, as the repeat will not make me do the presentation just the written. This is so frustrating!"
Anxiety,Seeking advice,"How is it possible to live with an emotional pain, that is for normal people unimaginable but it is happened to you. How is it possible to keep living and not commit suicide, because it is not something money or time would heal.

Thank you. I hope you have a great day."
Anxiety,My friends are no good for me and I feel terrible about it,"I've been struggling with anxiety and panic for years now and have it under control again. To do this, I've distanced myself from a lot of negative people I know,  one of them, a good friend I've known for many years. 

Every time we meet (met) up, she only rants and complains about people she works with and knows, whereas I was more interested talking about other things. I felt like she projectiled all her negativity onto me. 

I also have some good uni friends I'm still in contact with, but two of them have different levels of bipolar. With them, I also try to stay as positive and far away as possible without being rude or insulting. We mainly text each other, so I often switch my phone off on them. 

I feel like I've cut myself off from everybody i know and am trying to find new interests to meet new people which is really hard at the moment,  but don't just want to forget about my uni mates. 

I need to save my own sanity though and can't be their ""go to"" person 24/7."

I'm not sure on the rates of  cardiac arrests for my age range I do Google but it scares me even more.  I never feel normal in my head anymore and I feel like I'm living a outer body experience a lot of the time. I could almost understand why people kill themselves.

Anxiety,"Finger nail ""scratch"" and disease risk","I care a lot about my health, especially since the beginning of the pandemic. I recently finished my routine annual check and it was all good which helped calm my paranoia from interacting with people (I normally meet smokers, open mouth coughers, and lately live with people always coughing). The cough is not something I really care about, I mostly am worried about the long term effects on my career and travel that contracting some disease would have. 

Just after I got my health check results, I had my finger unintentionally ""pierced""/scratched by a woman. Although there was no visible blood or wound, this has kept me up for some days wondering just what I could have caught.  The thing is I noticed that a lot of people where I live did not really care about handwashing which I think contributed to my paranoia and generally avoiding touching anything. I could go for another test but this might be useless since this incident (nail pierce/scratch) happened just recently.

**Am I being overly paranoid or is there a real risk of me contracting some disease (e.g. STDs/STIs especially) from nail pierce/scratch?**

Anxiety,How do you deal with failure?,"I think this is going to be a long one. But I'll just start where I am now. 

I am very close to finishing my bachelor's degree in microbiology. By that I mean I only have to write 5 exams and that's it, I already wrote my bachelor's thesis and am done with all the lab courses. Where I come from, every exam at university can be done exactly 4 times. If you fail a 4th time, it's over. You can't study the particular field you failed in at this university anymore. 

Last friday I wrote a very important exam for the third time. I did everything I could, listened to all the lectures, wrote everything down, studied about 4-5 hours every single day for about 5 weeks. I also talked to my therapist a lot about this exam, months in advance. Although I was really anxious and stressed, this time I really thought it will be alright. But unfortunately it wasn't. Because of the pandemic all of the exams are online and it was so much harder. The problem wasn't really the questions but the little time we had. I didn't finish, even though I hurried, I didn't even answer one of four questions and because of the hurry, I made mistakes in the first two. It really looks bad again and I just don't know how to deal with it, if I failed again, which is very likely.

I spent the whole weekend crying and being anxious about everything, hating myself, doubting myself, not knowing how to survive this stress a fourth (and final) time. I regret that I even tried this online version of the exam and I can't understand how it went so badly even if I gave everything. I don't even know how to prepare next time or what to do differently. I'm starting to think that I just can't do it, that I am just too stupid for this. 

I am 29 years old and already wasted a lot of time studying something else just to drop out close to the end because I didn't like it. This time I felt like I really found the right thing for me. I really want to finish this, but I don't know how to deal with the stress of a fourth try where it means all or nothing. I know I should wait for the results first, but this can take up to 6 weeks and I really don't know how to get through this, my anxiety is suffocating me. It probably sounds overly dramatic but I just don't know what to do or how to forgive myself if I fail and the last 4 years were for nothing. 

How would you deal with this situation?"
Anxiety,"I can't stop dwelling, it's holding me back and making me feel awful. Looking for thoughts and opinions.","**TLDR:** I've spiralled into a mindset where I invalidate my own experiences and compare and despair with other people's experiences, considering myself inferior to others because I didn't hit some kind of expectation of what I should and shouldn't have done at certain ages. This is predominantly around my sexual partners and because I've only had a couple, I'm inferior to people who've had more.

Hi all,

I'm a 27yo male whose mental health has taken a slight downturn during lockdown - with growing insecurities and anxieties that I've never felt before. Before I begin, I *am* going to counselling, but even though it's helped, I don't feel like I'm there yet.

The reduced social contact all of us have experienced this year has brought about a change in me I didn't expect. Though normally I'm confident &amp; happy, through lockdown I've developed insecurities which though small at first have started to take a hold of me, change who I am and hold me back. Unfortunately,, most of these are of a social/sexual nature - so please stop here if this is an uncomfortable topic for you to broach (I was considering putting this in /r/relationships but didn't think it would be appropriate). As a bit of context I broke up with my first girlfriend of 2+ years just before everything kicked off in Feb/March - it was break up I instigated and don't regret.

Initially this insecurity was just ""I'm not social enough"" or that ""My social group isn't big enough"" and this was really easy to understand as everyone was probably feeling something similar to some extent. Though, it was more about looking into the past around my late teens or early twenties and feeling like somehow I'd missed out, that I didn't have the full experience that others had had - not that there is one defined experience. I know this is all irrational, but it's how I felt. Gradually this feeling got stronger and stronger and this core belief that I'm less than others reared it's ugly head. This led to me using other people's (different) social experiences to justify why I'm less than them or why they have ""it"" while I don't.

A couple of months further down the line and this exact same negative thought process got applied to my sexual (rather than social) relationships and this is the one that's really beaten me up. Though I'm generally in good shape, good company, am popular and have lots of friends, I've never been one to always have a sexual partner or girlfriend on the go. And this has never bothered me historically. I've always been comfortable with who/what I am and my limited number of sexual partners. But now this has changed (I hope not permanently) and I'm comparing and despairing when I (as before) compare my experiences to others. Again, it manifests as looking at people who've had lots of sexual partners/experiences as somehow better than me and have something I don't. They've got ""it"" and I therefore place them on a tier above me. Often this happens when talking to my close male friends who I've grown up with and, bar just a couple, have all had many sexual relations ranging from 50 - 150. In the past this has never been an issue, but now I feel inferior when compared to my closest friends who I've been so close to for so long that they're virtually siblings. One further example that has been bothering me a lot: I have a 50 yo female friend with whom I'm very close - it's platonic - but we often speak about her youth and I can't help but feel like I'm just so inferior to the kind of people she'd have partnered with in the past - again, not that I'd want to partner with her as she is now. She's had more sexual partners (14) than I've had (3 - and lost my virginity at 22) and she comes across as someone who is/was very popular and desirable and I hold myself to those standards and find myself lacking. Even when she talks about the odd fling here or there I can't help but think ""why can't I be someone's fling?"", ""Why couldn't I have had that impact on someone's life at that age?"" - It's all so irrational and odd. I don't feel desirable even though on paper I have no reason to not be and I wonder what's wrong with me and why I don't have ""it"". I've been waking up at night incredibly anxious and angry at myself, lots of it related to this idea that somehow my past sexual experiences were inferior and now I won't get them back and that despite being only 27 I've missed out for good, leaving me as a person with ""lesser"" experiences, indefinitely, and that I'm a lesser person for having such lesser experiences.

I've worked myself up quite a lot writing this, but I can't shake this grey cloud of inferiority and inadequacy looming over my head every minute of the day and night - this worthless, undesirable, inconsequential person who's defined by his (perceived) lack of quality experiences.

I appreciate this is a very long post, so if you've read this I'm incredibly grateful. I'm looking for opinions and thoughts on this. Again, I am going to counseling and we have made progress despite a recent dip.

Thanks again."

Anxiety,I ran out of Sertraline,"I ran out of my medication for anxiety, and because I have the worst memory, as usual I forgot my to order it. I usually do it on the day it runs out and go down to the pharmacy to pick it up after 5pm, but not only did I forget to order it until the day I ran out, but this time I also forgot to go and get it. 

That meant I had to go the full weekend until Monday with no medication. I started having mild withdrawals and felt like shit. 

That being said, I am incredibly proud of myself. I forced myself to eat tea downstairs with my family, and I then refrained from buying alcohol to make the night easier. I barely smoked too, compared to the usual amount. 

I’m just very proud of how I dealt with running out and coming off the meds, :) thanks for reading"

I love my dog and I hate people abusing them!! A dog can't consent and this is absolutely disgusting. I don't think I interpreted it as a sexual thing, more like a funny thing.

i think i also had a panic attack yesterday at school after 5 hours of sleep. my psych nurse told me to check my heart rate sometimes, because the last time it was a little high. i was at school and i checked my HR. i became worried because it was 100 and it started raising over 120... so my heart was pounding and i could see my heartbeat through my shirt. i was so jittery, my muscles were tense and legs were so stiff when i tried to walk. i was dizzy and i almost passed out. i was searching for ways to calm down your heartrate, but they didn’t work. this shit went away once i went outside and when i got home my heartrate lowered to 80. i was so tired and tense the rest of the day."
Anxiety,An NY Times report into Covid deaths has ramped up my health anxiety.,"As a hypochondriac, I've dealt with the pandemic better than I expected. Specifically my health anxiety hasn't been through the roof like I thought it would.

However, today I read an NY times deep dive into Covid deaths. I'm not going to link to it but it essentially listed out hundreds of people who died, their ages, and a description of who they were.

I was shocked to see around 15-20 people on the list aged between 14-40 who succumbed to this illness with no underlying health issues. I'm 30 years old and in good health, but apparently that is not enough to prevent the possibility of catching this illness and dying. 

I guess it just hit hard that I've been living with a much graver threat to my life than I imagined. My previous anxiety revolved around my parents getting covid. But now I'm freaking out about getting it myself. 

Not sure what advice I'm searching for but I had to post this somewhere."
Anxiety,21 bouncing from job to job and I'm EXHAUSTED,"I'm only 21 and I'm on my 11th job since I've been 17. A few of them being only for a month or less, but still. I just got out of a pretty shitty retail job and went to another better paying retail job. I was excited at first but now I'm back to the whole dreading work thing. Sometimes I can't even enjoy my day off the later in the day it gets because I know I have work the next day. Job after job ends up like this eventually, since quicker than others. Idk why I don't like my new job exactly but I think it's cause my last retail job, I'd zone out SO much sometimes and I guess it was a way to help me get thru the day. Also, my new job is giving me 6-8 hour shifts almost every day of the week and I JUST got here. I mean I know what I put for my availability, but now it just adds to the stress. I feel that maybe retail is too much for me mentally right now, but I don't want to quit ANOTHER job so quick and having all these jobs on an application makes it SO hard to get hired somewhere else.  But I know that I do NOT want to go to college and I know a lot of time that doesn't even help in getting a good job. I just want to be happy for once with the job that I have. It seems like no one likes their job but they're not quitting for whatever reason. I always feel like such a loser when I want to quit/quit another job without a lot of time going by. But once I call out one day for a mental health day, it's hard to not make it an every day thing. And the ppl around me tell me it's ok to take a mental health day and even a girl at work said that at the end of the day, it's about what's right for ME. I'm writing this and I have an 8-4 shift and a zoom job interview afterwards but idk about that. I'm kinda excited?? I've looked so hard for a work from home job but the ones I found were so low paying. It's hard to not just wanna lay in bed all day and sleep, but that's what wanna do. I wanna quit. I wanna call out. I wanna just lay in bed and be slightly happy. The days I do call out, I end up feeling better after the guilt of letting my fellow coworkers down. The hardest part is that it's ONLY me. I live with roommates, my family won't talk to me anymore and I'm single. I have no one to rely on if I did wanna quit my job and just take a break for a while.  It's just me, myself and I which I know other ppl are out there living their best life being like me but I'm not. And it just makes me feel so bad mentally and emotionally. Like I can't handle anything. I'm crying rn thinking about not wanting to go to work and being so sick of feeling like this. I HATE it."
Anxiety,"How do you go from completely lonely, to having friends?","I haven't had any friend in about 3-4 years and even then they weren't really close, just a school friend.

Firstly from a personal perspective - The struggles getting the confidence and motivation to want and be able to try to get friends.

But also from someone elses perspective - Trying to get someone whose interested in a friend, whose not normal, and is a basically a depressed loner."
Anxiety,I feel like I don’t deserve it and I cheated,"I have been doing kick boxing for almost 5 years now and I’m one of the more advanced students at my martial arts gym. I am young so a lot of the time I am up against people who are bigger than me.

Today was my grading so that I could move from my blue to red belt which meant I had to do 6 consecutive 2 minute rounds of sparing.

On my 5th I was pared up with a much bigger guy to just to boxing and he knocked me around good. He got me good a few times and it really took the energy out of me.

For my sixth round I had to spar with one of the very advanced people in my class but that 5th round really took the energy out of me. During the 6th round to catch my breath I backed away and sort of adjusted the pads that I was wearing but in a way I was just trying to catch my breath. 

Now I feel this extreme guilt because I was being graded on these fights and it feels that I cheated in a way.

Anxiety,My recent OCD and Anxiety,"Hi guys,

So every night when I go to sleep. I have to google to calm me down so I’m not anxious when I’m sleeping because I get anxious about getting up in the morning and feeling all this anxiety and dread.

This morning when I woke up I had an absolutely horrible feeling and straight away I went onto dr google. Worst thing to do and I looked up schizophrenia, paranoia and delusions. Now my issue just now is worried about being schizophrenic and being paranoid.

So this morning my girlfriend told me someone nearly ran her off the road on her way to work and this automatically made me think “what if that person was trying to hurt her or planning to get her” this gave me unbelievable anxiety and made me obsess over it again and again and again. Leading me to look up videos and google paranoid thoughts which tbh made me worse. Every single thing I done I made it relate to paranoia. Below are some examples that I came up with after constantly googling these symptoms and watching videos.

What if someone from the government was out to get me

What if someone is watching me through my laptop

My gran was on a call to her brother and it made me think, what if they are on a call planning to harm me.

What if my girlfriend isn’t at work and she’s just telling me she is

What is people are just generally out to get me.

All of the above I know are absolutely false, although the anxiety that comes with these type of thoughts and sometimes how real they feel is absolutely shocking and it takes me into a horrible state of anxiety and fear. I have been looking this up constantly for the past 2 weeks and honestly I’m terrified I’m going to lose touch with reality and believe all these things. Creating scenarios in my head of what might happen and causing myself even more anxiety.

Does this sound like OCD to anyone? For the record, I know these thoughts are ridiculous but when they come into my head it cripples me with anxiety. I am done with these thoughts now and wish they would just go away but I can’t seem to stop watching videos and reviewing these symptoms of schizophrenia and psychosis 🙄

Any response would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Brandon"

# Drinking blocks a chemical that promotes attention

.Norepinephrine release to cells is diminished, causing a cascade of effects.

N a new paper, researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio), report brain chemistry that may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

The work is funded by generous support from the Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and Helen C. Kleberg Foundation and by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute of Mental Health. Findings were published on Dec. 2 in *Nature Communications*.

""When we want to focus on something, or when we stand up from a chair and become active, a brain stem nucleus releases a chemical called norepinephrine. Acute alcohol exposure inhibits this signal in the brain,"" said senior author [**Martin Paukert, MD**](https://lsom.uthscsa.edu/physiology/team-member/martin-paukert-m-d/), assistant professor of cellular and integrative physiology at UT Health San Antonio...

Anxiety,What the hell has happened??,"12 days ago I was trialed on zoloft (baby dose) and taken cold turkey off my valdoxan (had been on it for a year)

I lasted about 7 days on zoloft before I was too sick and messed up to continue so stopped cold. Today (12 days on) I am stuck in a permanent state of agitation and back to back severe panic attacks. I am so uncomfortable and over this. Cant sleep or anything. I am using 2mg diazepam to try get through this. This is not what I am use to at all re: my anxiety.

I put two and two together and thought hang on - is my body not responding well to cold turkeying off Valdoxan??? Yes I know google and my gp says there is no withdrawal or taper required.. but I am not convinced.

Should I go back on valdoxan? I had no problems with it (nor much success) but hey here we are. I am ready to drive to the ER (but also know probably no point)

Anxiety,I get it now,"Hello all  
Like everyone, I have had some anxiety throughout life, but have always managed to put it into it's proper place in my mind to be able to deal with it. (""this is a sort term situation; this too will pass; remember that compared to X happening, this isn't so bad;"" etc.)

My SO has always had some level of anxiety, at times crippling. Over the many years we have been together I have tried to help when things get bad for him.

But recently I was put on an anti-cancer hormone blocker. I was having some typical physical issues, but the WORST was the anxiety. Any little stressor was sending me into spiraling thoughts that would not stop. And the thoughts were always the worst-case scenario type. My heart rate would go from 0-60 and then not calm down for hours.

I felt like my body was betraying me. My mind was trying to have the same calming conversations but my body was like ""RUN RUN RUN this is BAD"".

I had a follow up with the doctor last week and while in the waiting room I read an email that, on a normal time would piss me off but I would deal with; this time my blood pressure shot up, heart pounding, face flushed and honestly I was glad because the doctor got to see what I was talking about first hand. 

He immediately took me off the drug. It's been 5 days and I already feel soooo much better.

All of this to tell you all that now I understand the inability to get into a more calm place no matter how hard you try, your brain just won't let you. I told my SO the same thing: *I get it now*."

Part of being self employed requires that I perform on a daily basis or my money stops coming. This is accompanied by a lot of worry/stress about finding products that I will be able to push into the online space and be profitable with. I could lose everything I’ve built if I don’t. 

That’s part of the territory when you are self employed. I get that part but I feel like it’s bleeding over into other aspects of my life. I used to be very active. I used to play basketball 3-5 days a week and I get so tense that I can’t play now. I desperately want to play basketball again. I can’t even get in my truck to drive to the gym or the park without everything in my nose and throat feeling so thick that I feel like I’m choking. I feel like I can’t breathe. Breathing becomes very rapid. I gag until I eventually have to pull over and throw up. I just want to play basketball. All of this feels like it stems from work and feeling like I have to perform everyday. Anyone else deal with something like this and found anything that helps?"

Anxiety,Could this be anything other than anxiety?,"Hello everyone, 22M here

So for the past month and a half, I've had abdominal pain and general unwellness in that area that varies in location and type of pain (sometimes it feels like tiny needles and sometimes it feels more like a dull pain). I haven't had other symptoms, besides maybe a bit of nausea and bloating and I don't feel like it got worse over the course of the past month, which makes me think it's due to anxiety as it's been a stressful time for me. The fact that the pain can either be on my left or right side makes me think it's nothing serious as a more localised pain would mean something is wrong with a specific organ, but I'm still scared of it being something more serious?"

Anxiety,"I hate how my anxiety stops me from interacting with friends because it tells me no-one likes me. I want to speak more often to some friends, but it just gets in the way.","Hi all,

I had a bout of anxiety and depression a couple of weeks ago brought on by stress and feedback over my PhD work. This demotivated me and knocked me for six at the time, though it is under control now. However, it caused other subjects to give me anxiety while I was in a poor frame of mind and these are still giving me issues.

While I was feeling down I tried to perk myself up by reminding myself of my qualities, and how I think I am a good person regardless of my work. However, my anxiety latched on to this and brought down my opinion of myself here by convincing myself that friends don't really like me. 

For instance, my university ran this group chat thing with other students weekly. One of my friends went on it and suggested that we could video call instead if it didn't work out when it was first ran. She has stopped going to it since, and not many other people frequent it regularly. As such, I want to ask if we could skype instead on a regular basis. However, I feel so anxious about asking and I worry about how I am perceived. Every time I consider it, I just get doubts in my head saying that I will come across as needy, she won't really want to, so don't do it and she doesn't really like you as a friend. It feels like my anxiety seizes on every argument I make in favour of doing this and spins it against me. If I want to speak it will be seen as me being desperate for attention and unwanted because they dislike me, if I don't then I get anxious about not being seen as a friend or whatever. No matter what I do I feel anxious about it and I am left confused and beaten down by my own thoughts.

It's not helped by me being paranoid over it as well. I have a friend I live with who regularly video calls her, and has done since pandemic restrictions began. My anxiety then tells me it's obviously because you're not really a friend, unlike him, which just adds to the problem. Then I have a go at myself for being jealous and that no-one cares about me enough. It's not like I want it to be a competition, I don't care about competing with other friends over friends' affection, I just want to feel like I am still friends with others I care about and can still feel like we're in contact while it's harder to be. Before we'd go to the pub/go on a hike or whatever, but this is not so easy now with the pandemic.

In reality, I suspect it's my housemate who initiated this and it is not a reflection of my other friend trying to shun me. I know he speaks to other friends regularly on video calls, so when I think rationally I don't think I have been shunned because I am not liked. Though, it doesn't stop the anxieties which focus on the hypothetical worries and make them seem real.

I also think that I am growing fed up of lockdown restrictions. Not because I disagree with their need, but just fed up on a human level. Every day is the same, I speak to the same people every day, and not much changes. I can't do stuff like speak to friends I don't live with at the pub any more. So I miss them and wish I could speak to them again in a face-to-face setting (i.e. a video call), rather than just over messaging software. I have also been too passive, I feel, in trying to keep contact like I would want. I feel the need to change and speak more often to friends, but I have always stopped myself for some reason; I don't want to carry on like that now. However, I end up anxious about trying to start this, worrying that they won't want to, even if they have indicated a will before. I end up thinking that they were just saying that. My heart starts pounding and my arms shake just from thinking of typing a message to start a conversation on this and I feel ridiculous. These are friends of mine, but I am feeling like I am anxious to the extent something bad will happen because of them and anxieties over their perceptions of me.

I think they would be sad that I feel like this for wanting to initiate a flippin' video call. It doesn't help that I feel like I can't air any of these feelings with anyone, because I don't think people would understand, they'd see me as some needy and desperate fool for thinking like this and I don't want to burden people with my mental health issues. However, bottling it up just causes me to dwell on these anxieties with little reassurance and it leaves me feeling upset and anxious.

It's so sapping having to battle this. Having to try and calm myself with rational arguments against my fears, while my anxieties rage on telling me how bad I am, how no-one really likes me and you're better off not engaging with desires to speak to my friends. I just wish I could confidently send out a message to the friend I mentioned above, and others I've thought about contacting as I have realised I want more contact. I wish I could do it without worries over whether they'd agree or through convincing myself I am not wanted to be spoken to because I am not liked, and even if they agree it's only through pity. I worry that friends I haven't spoken to in a while would just shun me. I don't have any reason to think they will, but I can't stop the worries over something so needless.

Also, I feel so down because I have recently completed CBT. My therapist was pleased with how I progressed in this and I did feel like I had come on strong and had methods of dealing with my anxieties. This setback has made it feel like I wasted it and learned nothing from it. It has made me feel like a fraud for how I had communicated my progress with my therapist, when I thought it was going well. 

Thanks for reading. I just needed to vent my feelings after trying to bottle them up and work things out to little avail so far."
Anxiety,Is it a good idea to buy a noise cancelling headphones?,I don't think I need to say why I need them but I get scared from any voice.
Anxiety,Calling.out,"I wish I would actually get sick so I could call out from work without feeling guilty about lying. I'm just so fucking tired, I feel like it is one of those days where I want to just spend the day in bed. Why do I need to wake up at 7:45 am everyday to work for 8.5 hours straight? Who designed this as being adult life? Tired of the pretty much constant anxiety during work, it feels like I am in constant fight or flight."
Anxiety,Anxiety over potential rejection,"I’ve been seeing this guy for a bit as a sort of friends with benefits relationship, but we both agree that it has potential to be more. But I can’t enjoy a minute of it because I’m constantly worrying that he’ll just start ignoring me out of nowhere. It comes from multiple experiences where people have just started ignoring me out of nowhere. And now I feel so panicky and like I’m going to vomit because I’m so worried that I’ve already messed everything up. I feel like I just need a catharsis but I can’t manage to shed a single tear or anything. It just feels like this ball of tense emotions are just stuck inside me and I have no idea how to get rid of them. What can I do to get some peace. I feel like I’m going insane. I just need some peace just so I can feel like I can keep going."
Anxiety,Anyone notice a difference when they eat more nutritiously?,I have PTSD/Anxiety from a birth experience 2 years ago - my panic attacks now seem to have no trigger at all and just come whenever they want but usually in the middle of the night. Yesterday I thought I had been doing really good - just got back into exercising daily but I ate like crap all day and panic attack at night so I'm curious if anyone else has noticed that when they eat less nutritious food that their anxiety is worse?
Anxiety,Quitting Job Anxiety,"I am new here, so apologies if I am doing this wrong. 
I need to quit my job, I have to. It’s killing most days, and on days when it’s not, I am still anxious for the next killing task on my way. I don’t know what I would do next, or if I will be able to. It feels like forever that I’ve been stuck here, I am overwhelmed, unsure and going insane every day. And I know these are enough reasons, yet somehow I am not able to take the step and have some faith in myself that I am not completely vain. Any advice would be appreciated. 
Thanks."
Anxiety,Anxiety making me lose control sometimes?,"Don't know if this is anxiety related symptom or not but I'm having genuine trouble here. I have diagnosed anxiety. I have an assignment due in 2 days that is long that I'm working on but whenever I work on it or think of it. It causes my body to freeze up, my joints become frozen and then started moving weirdly, not entirely sure what this is at all."
Anxiety,don't know if this is anxiety related or just my inability to engage life in a healthy way,"(**F 24**) 

I moved from Italy to the United Kingdom more than a year ago after leaving University. I started working part-time in retail to cover housing costs. This job is draining me. I usually work only 5h shifts four times a week, but I **can't** do it anymore. It's been months since the first time I realised I needed a change but my anxiety advices me to stick to this job as it's the one thing that keeps me going at the moment. I have this feeling if I am brave enough to leave that place I won't find any other job and I'll have to come back home. I get so frustrated at times I lose hope in everything and everyone around me. Please join the conversation and tell me about your stories. I need comfort"
Anxiety,I'm sick of fighting my head,"I don't want to go to work, I don't want to eat. I just want to stay in bed and sleep. I already called out sick yesterday, and I don't think I can do that today. There's nothing bad at work, it's all made up crap in my head that's making me worry. I'm not even worried about work, funny enough I'm stressing about my health, and the solution my stupid brain has decided on is to just shut down. My mind just keeps going in circles, and I can't stop it. I wish I never woke up this morning.

I've got a doctor's appointment in a couple of days with a GP. Its the first time I've seen a doctor in 20 years, and I'm terrified. I've been broken this entire weekend, going from stressed to full on shaking uncontrollably and crying over these past few days. I feel stupid about going to the doctor's when this pandemic is going on, but I can't keep going like this.

It's now one hour before I'm supposed to go to work, and all I want is to hide. This happened before about 15 years ago, and last time this happened, instead of going to work, I just drove past work and kept driving the whole day trying to escape. I ended up quitting my job the next day. 

I feel like running away again, just drive away and disappear. I'm sick of this fight."
Anxiety,Can the fear of having intrusive thought be an intrusive thought ?,"Needless to say i'm going through a pretty shitty period in my life.

i'v been on CBT therapy for about a month and a half now, while i made huge progress on my agoraphobia (i can basically go anywhere without being scared) it has taken its toll on my mood and i drifted into depression.

While i managed to cut the link between anxiety and agoraphobia, my anxiety is still verry much alive an well and feeds on various topics. The most recent one being intusive thoughts.

So my questions are, can the fear of intrusive thoughts be considered intursive thought on its own?

since these thoughs/fears are directly linked to my  current depressive/anxious state, will they go away when i'm no longer depressed ?"
Anxiety,I failed the exams,I'm a pharmacy student and I'm suffering from anxiety before my admission to University but I didn't knew about it and everyone says to me that you're fine but I felt broken inside me. During University I suffered from anxiety from time to time due to which I failed my exams. Now I'm giving 2nd year exams while others are giving 3rd year exams. This situation has made me more anxious and I always think about how I'll manage this situation. Besides this I'm always worried about my future. I'm going to be married soon but I am worried how will I spend practical life with anxiety. It makes me feel that I'm unable to do anything in my life.
Anxiety,I’ve met a girl who I really like but I can’t see her again for at least 6 weeks and I can’t stop worrying.,"She might find somebody else, she might only want to be friends (even though we met on tinder). Another worry I have now is that she might be transgender (even though there’s literally nothing to suggest she is and doesn’t resemble a man at all). I don’t have anything against trans people but I’m just not attracted to them. 

I just can’t get her out of my head which just creates all this worry and there’s honestly nothing I can do about it. I’ve never had a relationship before as well so it also feels too good to be true."
Anxiety,My mom isn’t feeling well. Feeling a panic attack coming at work right now.,My mom is coughing and it’s a more dry cough 😞 she has a runny and stuffy nose and some aches. She said it’s probably the flu. Of course I’m just thinking and assuming the worst. I didn’t go near her since she was coughing quite a bit. And I’m trembling at work right now and feeling short of breath because of anxiety over my mom feeling under the weather.
Anxiety,Working remotely is both a blessing and curse,"Pre-pandemic I worked in one of those open office layouts, which is the WORST. Absolutely no privacy, but thankfully my laptop has a built-in privacy filter which limits what can be seen on the screen if you aren't viewing it straight ahead sitting/standing in front of it. The feeling of constant exposure, as there are *always* eyes on you, well maybe it's in my head that everyone can see me and no one is actually *watching* since they're busy with a million other things. There are just so many things wrong with open offices. People can just walk up to you when they feel like it, no matter how ""busy"" you look with headphones in and concentrated look on your face. But if you have your headphones on too loud then you *can't hear* around you to be ready for anyone passing by too close or approaching your ~~desk~~ seat at the table. Corporate theorists thought the open office would lead to greater collaboration, but it can be pretty hard to work with all the distractions around you and no dividers like even a half-height cubicle. Making eye contact with the person on the other side of the table through the crack between your computer monitors? Lovely! Being torn about what to make small talk about and for how long with the person next to you? Amazing!

Thank God one good thing of the pandemic is  if and when large offices open up back to scale, the open office I imagine is history, at least ""hotelling"" likely is, where you don't get an assigned desk and it's just a free-for-all every morning. 

So I thought working from home would be all that jazz. And it is. I don't have to stress over my clothes. I can park myself at a desk next to a window and get natural light which is impossible in a corporate open office, I can open said window and receive fresh air, and it's even relatively quiet! No raucous cackling emanating from the similarly open communal kitchen, or gossip queens chitchatting a desk seat over from you.

BUT what I tend to struggle with sometimes is projecting. When I don't get a response (within a reasonable time frame), when I don't get a thank you, when I have to follow up (I always feel like I'm imposing and wish all communications would just be a seamless flow, and I sometimes feel slighted when I get a follow-up like 'what's your timing look like'? I feel like saying ""BITCH I'LL SEND IT WHEN I SEND IT HOLD TF UP""). So the negative of working from home I've found is you really lose that body language from others, especially those on your team or are collaborating with. I've always been more comfortable as an individual contributor and I vaguely manage one associate which I always feel like I'm not doing well. It's just a struggle because I'm always assuming that the work I produce isn't up to snuff unless I get a clear acknowledgement in words. No amount of phone calls or even video calls can make up for it.

It was actually working in an open office that was the catalyst for me to initially seek treatment for my anxiety. Overall, I really hope working remotely is here to stay and big corporate offices can burn in hell, unless they give everyone a nice private cubicle or office with 4 walls and a DOOR.

Thank you for listening."
Anxiety,Crappy sleep and heightened anxiety,"I’m not sure this is a thing but whenever I have a crappy sleep which is quite often lately my anxiety is at a high the next day. Fast heart beats, palpitations, chest pain, dizziness. I’m so sick of anxiety! Just want it to go away!"
Anxiety,What should I do ?,"I can't communicate with others . I don't have Autism . I just can't ... 

I make people feel bad when I talk to them . I don't know why I'm like this . I did that to my cousin 2 times . I just did a verbal litigation  with her (a few years ago) because of something that wasn't important or I just wanted her to listen to me . I don't know why did I do that . 

I found a friend 3 days ago . I was depressed so I talked to her in instagram she made me feel better with talking to me . But today I said hi to her but she didn't respond  (she was online) . 

I don't know why I can't talk to any boy or girl . I think I talk about my feelings more than it needed to . Btw I'm a 16 boy . Probably I will not be able to find the person I like (love) .. because I can't talk correctly .. I do talk too much or I spamm soo many things like if some say ""I like music"" I spamm soo many musics for them .

I don't know what's my peroblem ... I don't know why ... Why am I doing this ? Why do I make everyone hate me ? Why am I like this ...
 

Why ? ..."
Anxiety,I hate talking to my boss. A previous job experience makes me so.... so anxious...,"Everytime I have to talk to her, I feel like my heart will jump out of my mouth. It's just horrible. She is a nice person and all, and nothing bard ever happened between us, but because of a previous job experience, I always think she is going to snap at me and that I'm always going to do something wrong. 

I walk on eggshells every week and it's terrible. Even when I'm not talking to her, I suffer from antecipation."
Anxiety,On the edge of sanity: I need some advice or to hear from others who are going through this.,"I’m a 33 Male. I have a lot of health-related anxiety. I have irregular heartbeats (PVCs and PACs) that never go away. I’ve had every test from EKGs to echocardiograms, to stress tests, and long term holters. They always tell me that they can detect the irregular beats but that they are benign and won’t harm me. I’ve always struggled with this answer. 
Lately, my anxiety is becoming permanent. I’m in constant fear. I’m lightheaded all the time, I get strange brain and body ‘zaps’ and I twitch all over. I cannot take my mind off anything other than the panic. I am missing work, I am not sleeping, and I feel like I’m going insane. At night, I awake suddenly in a state of panic, shaking violently, and then never go back to sleep. My heart palpitations get much worse during a panic attack which in turn makes me panic more. I have been up to emergency four times in the last month. Each time they tell me that my heart issue is benign and that I need to relax. I’m at my limits. I’m losing control of reality. I try to meditate and stay calm, but it doesn’t work for long. I’m not on an SSRI as I’m afraid of the long term affects on the heart. I have tried a few Lorazepams before, and while it stops a panic attack, my doctor won’t prescribe it because he says its addictive. I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. I live life in constant panic as if I were being attacked by a lion 24/7. It never ends… I can’t do this.  Please help me… anybody."
Anxiety,I did it! I reached out for help.,"A couple months back, I made a post about struggling to ask for help, and yesterday, I emailed the resource center at my university explaining my situation and asked for accommodations for the future. It was hard to do, and as I was writing the email, I kept questioning myself and thinking that whoever reads the email is going to think I’m over exaggerating or “stupid,” but I racked up some courage and sent the email.  

Now, I’m just really anxious on what they’re going to say, but I’m proud that I even sent the email."
Anxiety,Head feels fuzzy,"That's the best way I can describe it.  When I'm anxious my head feels weird and everything is hard to focus on and I'm easily startled.  I can't tell if it's a real medical problem that is causing me to be anxious or my anxiety causing me to feel that way.    

Do others experience this?  It would be nice to know I'm not alone on this."
Anxiety,Having a bad day.,Everytime I leave this sub I feel like I'm doing better with my anxiety but I come back ten times worse. I'm having a really bad day today and I have cried. I just want to roll up in a ball and never come out. I don't know what to do anymore.
Anxiety,Do you ever feel like people will harm you?,Anyone?
Anxiety,I tried this strategy to help calm down.,"Slow down your thoughts. 
I mean, literally. Think your thoughts as if they'd been slowed extremely like a [DJ screw track](https://youtu.be/K_h55O66uf0)
or those scenes in movies when someone is dazed and people are talking to them but their words are slowed and stretched. 
""Sloooooooow doooown' 
My therapist gave me the advice that to calm my hyperactive nervous system I should do things slowly. Even speak slowly. When you slow down, it lets your body know you aren't in real danger. So I took a litter futher and did it with my thoughts.
She also recommended the book ""The Body Keeps the Score"". 
If you try it, let me know how it went. Keep your head up folks, y'all are really brave."
Anxiety,Is anxiety hereditary?,"So this got me wondering, my father definitely has social anxiety/depression, I also have social anxiety. do you think there is some hereditary component to it?"

Anxiety,My boyfriend come back after bad fight,"I am really anxious.  At some point he blcoked me but he come back saying ""Hi"". I have no idea what to tell him...help"
Anxiety,I burned myself out,"I've never been disciplined, it's my day to day struggle since I can remember. This is important because knowing this, I decided to take a huge challenge. 

I saw my SO taking a well paid job (not a lot really, just enough to cover me for a while) as an opportunity to start my own 'business' as a therapist but also as a mental health instructor (designing healthy relationships and self esteem classes and such). 

I started doing all I could: enrolled myself in classes to give a better service, started managing my social media account, learned a little bit of graphic design so I could share my own ideas through pleasant pictures, advertised myself, planned a talk in front of 100 people, made a healthy couples relationships workshop, read 4 books at the same time (it's a hard habit for me since I get distracted easily lol), started writing a goddamned book... I just took too much and one day I woke up and was too tired to go on.

I told this to my SO and he told me to take a week off, so I offered to take all his house keeping responsibilities in exchange. So I'm on it. The only thing I kept is the therapy because cmon I can't leave my patients stranded and that's my most favorite duty.

I think I feel guilty of letting my SO carry all the money responsibilites, and I want to make it up to him asap, even if he's told me over and over again that it's no problem to him, that he's fine with this arrangement. He says Im being too cruel to myself.

Besides, the psychology business is a challenging one... The market is plagued with alternative 'therapies' that end up being temporary solutions and charge way more than me... I'm trying my best to be as professional as possible and all that effort seems meaningless every time I see people preaching nonsense and getting more attention than me. I'll keep trying, I'm just tired for now.

Thanks for reading, and sorry for my English, I haven't practiced it for a while."
Anxiety,Anxiety nausea causing anxiety,"So I've had anxiety-related nausea for about 5-ish months now. From August, it has seemed to improve, but now I think it's taken a bit of a turn. For about a week now, it's hit me pretty hard. I feel very anxious and I don't even know what I'm anxious about (well, apart from anxiety itself). 

On Thursday, I'm going out with a friend for quite a few hours and I think this is a big step for me. I'm going to an ice rink and then her house for pizza, and I'm *terrified* my anxiety-nausea is gonna hit me then, because it loves to come at the worst times. I'm praying it won't hit me, but I'm just so anxious about it.

Of course, I'm not going to cancel this thing with my friend, but I'm quite anxious. I think my anxiety might have sourced from just being tired and everything because this is the last week of this school term before the holidays - I'm hoping its just that.

I would really really appreciate it if anyone could reply with *any* tips that help take their mind of anxiety and helps their nausea (if they have it) settle down, and also how to ignore anxiety when out with friend etc. It would be extremely comforting and helpful for me :)

Have a great day/evening :)"
Anxiety,I'm really torn apart,"I've been going to in person learning after a few months of doing online learning recently, and I've been having really bad anxiety about getting Covid. We tried to find a way to go back to online learning, but they said there was no way. So I accepted that, and had to go to school with horrible health anxiety. But, today, that changed and now I can do virtual again. Great, right? Except for the fact that I'm going to have to say bye to all of my friends again, and that hurts me. And to make it even worse, I dont think any of my friends take Covid as seriously as I do, and they all wanted me to sit at a crowded lunch people full of people eating, and I had to tell them no. I feel like a bad person just because I didnt feel comfortable. I told them that I was worried about Covid, and they made me feel bad about it. I just wanna be normal again. I just want to feel safe again."
Anxiety,all of a sudden started to need to take naps?,"hi im 18 and have had anxiety for years and all of a sudden when i get home from school i sometimes need a nap. i know stress can make you tired but recently ive been improving my mental health and have been feeling abit more normal than usual, i never used to feel like i could take a nap as i was so worried all the time and would tire myself out from stress late at night and im really not used to this. is it healthy for an 18 year old to need to take a nap now and again for a couple hours? thanks in advance"
Anxiety,What has worked for you?,"What have you tried that help/cure your anxiety? Also.. What have you tried that didn't help at all?

I'm not so much interested in coping, but rather what has actually helped you make progress toward being better and changing and what you've tried that didn't help you take any forward steps?"
Anxiety,A couple nights ago something happened I still can't explain,I was j chilling at home and some people came over. My roommates sister was over and I couldn't remember her name. (I don't know if that's important or not). Everyone but me decided to leave. And all of a sudden I just started having an anxiety attack and I still don't know why. I like being alone so I don't think it's that. I like the people that were there and wasn't worried about that in any way. Explanations? Experiences?
Anxiety,Anyone else gets the feeling that everything looks strange?,"Hard to describe, but I suddenly get these panic attacks out of nowhere, where I feel everything just looks strange. That things are to small/big, or to close/far away, or something.

It also feel like things are blury, or just ""strange"". 

This triggers anxiety and I start to think that I am going mad etc. If I can't calm down it leads to a full blown panic attack, but I can manage to control it by focusing on breathing and distracting myself with  something on my phone or something. Or benzos :P

Is this what they call depersonalization?"
Anxiety,Advise? Help? Need something.,"Hello, I am 30, 31 in two days time. I've been living with depression and anxiety for 16 years, managed quite well for  13 years, then due to work and health related circumstances I had a break down and had to reach out for help. I have had CBT, multiple medications and nothing has worked to help me get back to a manageable mind frame, I am currently house bound, I can't work as I can't leave the house without my wife anymore. My anxiety is heavily focused on the social aspect, I can't talk to a stranger for more than about 2 minutes while alone, and then even when with my wife she has to input on my behalf heavily. My insecurities and paranoia are centered on my own self critical thoughts, I have lived the better part of my life believing I am scum, worth less then the air everyone else breathes, undeserving of happiness, I was a huge self saboteur, used to self harm a long time a go. This year has been horrendous, we lost out baby, was to be our third child, at the beginning of the year, we had to make the choice to end the pregnancy early, then coronavirus happened, getting stuck in the house, not a huge loss for me being a huge hermit and anti social and full of anxiety, more of a impact on my wife though. Which leads to the past week, I thought I was handling this year better than I actually am, thought I had everything under check, more motivation, less shouting in my mind, calmer and cooler. However this is not true, my wife, whom I should clarify we have been married for 3 years, together for 9 years and known each other for 15 years, best friends, we are each others soul mates, not a term I really like to use but it is the case for us, which is why I am having such a difficult time. My wife has started doing a great thing, doing things to make herself feel better, just little things, getting dressed daily, started yoga, make up on daily, she also deals with anxiety and not liking herself, so it's great that she is taking steps to feel better in her own skin. She watched a lot of YouTubers, especially The Sims tubers, which led to twitch, which led to other streamers that don't really play games she's interested in, but the people themselves are grand people, then she becomes friends with some of them, super, we are both friendless, have been for ages, just been us, especially this year, this took place over a few months, then this past week, she became best friends with one of the streamers, male, straight, long distance girlfriend, has issues of his own not my place to say. He needed a friend the other night, my wife was there for him, good, answered the phone to him, the only person she will talk to on he phone is me, has been for years, she has huge anxiety when it comes to phones. First time I felt it, paranoia, jealousy, the undeservingness, then I thought I picked up on her being secretive, putting headphones on, so she doesn't distract me, taking her phone upstairs on a night more, talking to this new friend, a lot, like the level we did when we first got together, like when you have a crush, I got so stupid with it, started ignoring my wife, acting like it was falling apart, when there was no evidence of what I was thinking, in fact the evidence proved the opposite, my wife still told he daily she loves me, there was no gap, no love lost, she was just, or is just having a new friend, and her own anxiety makes he need to talk that much and respond fast so in her words doesn't upset anyone, she finally pulled the truth from me, and understood me, understood why I was being this, why it hit me hard, and I got over it for a day, then got stupid again, my paranoia and anxiety niggling in the back of my brain, shouting at me that something was happening, I got quiet again, we had another good cry and talk and I told her more of my feelings, again got back to normal, then without realising I was still judging her, kept looking when she picked up her phone, this was yesterday, we argued, cried, talked and all the soppy stuff, she still loves me, and now I hate myself even more for letting things get like this, I loathe myself on a daily basis, my biggest flaw is how critical I am to myself, every time I have looked in he mirror today, I have felt physically repulsed, just wanting to hurt myself, punish myself. My wife has offered for me to talk to her friend, even asking me to just lurk on the streams, join in when I'm ready and join the group become friends, or at the very least find someone to talk to, make friends of my own of I can't join hers. So TLDR, I am a mess, need advice or just a friend, I have no-one, don't want to worry my wife more than needed with my inner most thoughts, but I can't keep going on like this, I am so angry at myself right now, like I am the devil incarnate on my own eyes, I usually play video games to distract myself from my thoughts, works for the most part, but right now I can't do it, I have no interest in anything but despising myself and wanting to make sure I don't upset my wife more, the only thing in my life that matters to me is making my wife and children happy, somehow giving them the life they deserve, but I think I need to do what my wife is doing right now, find a way to be happy with myself or at the very least for the mean time not hate myself so much. I profusely apologise for the length of this super essay, but I don't talk to anyone at all so, I have less social skills than a limbless mime, so I find it hard to condense or just talk, sorry."
Anxiety,Doubting my own anxiety,"Last night I couldn't sleep thinking that maybe my anxiety it's not anxiety. Maybe I'm making up this symptoms/feelings in my mind just to ""call someone's attention"". Maybe when I can't breathe it's just me pretending and those thoughts drove me crazy. Do I really suffer from anxiety? Am I doubting myself due to anxiety?

Btw I do therapy, I know I have anxiety, but sometimes I'm not sure, sometimes I feel like I might be overreacting. Everyone shakes right? Everyone has doubts?"
Anxiety,I went to the dentist today after 10+ years of fear,"I've had dental anxiety since I was a kid. I had bad dentists, they were mean and condescending even wen I was a young adult. My parents never cared to teach me proper dental hygiene. My sister got braces and has perfectly straight white teeth. Mine are literally rotting out of my face(well, just one right now...)

Anyway. I missed my first appointment and they rescheduled and it was today. Everyone was so nice I almost cried. I know my teeth are bad and they didn't lecture me or treat me like a child. They explained everything going on in my mouth and we're working on a treatment plan. They did a cleaning and he said I did great, and that he couldn't even tell I was nervous. I have two more deep cleaning sessions in the next few weeks... Best present I've given myself.

I'm so happy I did this and just like all the other things I've been pushing myself to do I wish I had done it sooner.

Anxiety,I had the worst panic attack of my life today,"I had the worst panic attack of my life today

To give some back drop I’ve been struggling more severely with anxiety and panic attack issues over the last year or so more than I have in any other time in my life. I’m a 30 year old male, Married, and moved about a year ago away from where I grew up to live near my wife’s family. 

Today was a pretty ordinary day. We had plans to go visit my wife’s brother who is in a home of sorts due to his cerebral palsy and non verbal nature. After that was to spend some time with her parents for dinner, and then do some grocery shopping as we have been slacking on doing our weekly grocery run. Throughout the day now that I look back I could sense something rising within me. I felt my vision was kind of skewed in a sense. Nothing was out of place but.. I felt out of place, if that makes sense? This has been an ongoing issue with having physical symptoms as such. Sometimes tightness and pain in my chest, sometimes a knot in my throat that makes it hard to breathe. All things I’ve been working on coping with while having these symptoms. Spending time with her brother was splendid as usual (he’s actually very charismatic and fun to be around). Dinner with her family was great. They are truly my new parents in a sense as mine in my home state are not as easily accessible to talk or be around. 

Then we get to the grocery store. A mildly busy but rather large grocery store that we wanted to visit and try shopping there for fun honestly more than anything. The second I got out of the car I felt my throat almost gripped. With no warning, no rhyme no reason. Just tension. I tried to play it off as something not so serious as I usually do and go through my routine of talking to myself. “Your having some anxiety   it’s going to be okay, just breathe.” But as we progressed through the store and the more we went from aisle to aisle it became more evident that this lump in my throat was getting tighter. My brain started it’s usual mixed feedback loop of “it’s going to be okay nothings wrong” and “this feels different than before.. maybe somethings wrong.” As we walk the aisles my chest begins to tighten. I feel pain, not a lot of pain but enough to be noticeable and cause it to grab my attention. At this point my wife knew something was up. I wasn’t being as attentive to what we were shopping for and simply replying with yes and no or maybe. I confessed “I’m having some anxiety. I don’t have my medication on me but I’ll be okay.” My wife’s truly an amazing woman who I am so blessed to be with. She knew I wasn’t okay and needed to get home to take my medication and try and relax. We got our groceries, paid, and packed up for home. 

On the drive home I began to notice pins and needles in my hands. Then almost a sensation as if they were on fire. I was still unsure if I was really in full blown panic mode or if I could get home and get my meds and meditate before it got worse. We pulled into a parking spot outside our apartment and my worst nightmare came true.

As soon as I parked the car it was if all of this pent up anxiety exploded in a single moment. My feet and hands felt like they were on fire. I couldn’t breathe. I was staring straight ahead into nothingness and it back at me. A wave came over my body “you are dying” it said. Every fiber of my being screaming internally that I was losing my mind. It was as though I disassociated with my surroundings and I was no longer me. I was dizzy and filled with dread. My wife held my hand as inaudibly motioned I needed to go. She walked me inside to our apartment and I took my medication, went to our bedroom and turned off all the lights, hid under a blanket and cried. 

This lasted for maybe an hour, the anxiety piece of it until the medication I take took it’s effect. I was I’m shock. Still am in shock. I’ve had panic attacks with some similar feeling but this... It felt other worldly. It has truly made me feel broken and I am so in fear of something like this happening again. 

I share this in hopes that others who experience things like this don’t feel alone. And to know I’m not alone in what I feel. 

Thank you."

Anxiety,Anxiety Dreams,"Hey guys!

So I have pretty much considered myself a lucid dreamer for a while; I am starting to realize this is incorrect terminology. 

Some people talk about their dreams like they are watching a TV show, but my dreams are very much real and a warped world. 

I have had very very VERY vivid dreams my entire life to the point that I have to be very careful what I put into my brain out of fear of my dreams. An example would be that I refuse to watch any zombie movie or any video game related to them because I once had a dream I was eaten alive and very much felt it. 

I have been looking into anxiety related dreams and found that a dream I had the other night fit the bill. It was a dream regarding my brand new vehicle being stolen from me. Another vehicle turned into a watercraft at a cheer competition and everyone had to evacuate because of a hurricane. There is obviously a lot more context to this but much of it can be tied to my life and past experiences. 

It is very hard for me to explain my dreams to people and they do not seem to understand the extent to which this affects me. I tried to explain it to my SO but got frustrated and it turned into an argument because they would not listen. I want to solve my anxious issues but I don’t think I can do this without having the words to explain my dreams. It causes me to have a fear of sleeping sometimes purely just due to my vivid dreams.

My dreams don’t feel like they’re dreams. They feel like I’m transitioning into another world and back. 

Please share your dreams and if you’re have had any experience with this or even if you have the words to help. 💜"
Anxiety,Took today off from work.,"I called out of work today. I actually feel pretty guilty about it, but lately I've been very mentally strained (even while I'm on antidepressants), and the mere thought of going to work today made me miserable. I've been under a lot of stress lately. 

So I'm gonna shower, eat some good food and get some rest. 

Make sure to always take care of yourself, guys. (:"

Anxiety,Valdoxan tips and tricks for drowsiness,"I've taken SSRIs for a few years, however the side effects were beginning to impact my relationship, so it's been a process to change meds the last 6 months.  
I'm currently on 50mg Valdoxan, and it's been fine, except for the drowsiness. 

Previously, I'd sleep for 7-9 hours and mostly wake up feeling refreshed. Now I sleep for 9-10+ (9-10pm to 6:30-7am) and I'm already so drowsy, yawning and wanting to go straight back to sleep from the second I wake.

I've now leave my blinds open, being woken up by the natural light. 

I've started to get out of bed and go for a walk as soon as I wake up. Otherwise i'm just so tired and will lay on the couch and dread the day, which triggers anxiety/depressive thoughts. 

I'm thinking maybe to take them earlier in the evening, so it wares off earlier? 

Any other tips or tricks to help curb it?"
Anxiety,Rant(?): I’m... feeling a lot of things.,"Hi there everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place to be posting, but I really hope that if it isn’t, you guys could direct me in the right place to post. 
I’m sorry about the formatting, I’m typing on my phone. I’m using a second account, because my main account has details about my personal life which I would prefer not talking about. 

I don’t really know where to turn to, or what to do when it comes to my anxiety. I’m a high school senior, and there are a lot of things going on. There are the obvious things that seniors face, like college, final exams coming up in March, lockdown (which has gone on since March, in my country). 

But other than these things, everything seems to be falling on top of me... it all seems like too much for me to handle. I’ve faced anxiety since eighth grade, and now I feel like I’ve finally reached the brink.

I have no one around me to trust, or talk to completely openly; there’s family, but they have their own issues, both on an individual level and with each other (I wish I could elaborate on this, but I really can’t because of personal reasons.) Then there’s the friends aspect, where for some reason I feel like everyone has gotten so close to each other whereas I’ve just slowly fallen into my own hole, with no possibility of climbing out from. 

I’ve tried seeing my school counsellor, and she’s surprisingly been incredibly helpful, but I feel like I’ve hit a dead end with her too. I’ve tried to get better, do all the things that people say improve your mental health, but it just made me feel worse; the failure of completing such small and simple tasks make me feel so much worse about my own existence. I’ve felt myself losing my appetite, my ability to study, and my ability to sleep. 
In the recent months, I’ve found myself actively telling myself to go take a nap, and my answer to most things being ‘I want to sleep.’ Even when I’m not really tired. 

I don’t understand what to do, how to stop myself from getting worse. On top of all this, I have a younger sibling, who is the only person who can understand anything I’m saying, but I’m scared that if I tell her too much about how I’m feeling she’ll become incredibly stressed and end up spiralling about my issues. I don’t want her to face the problems I’m facing, but I’m failing at that too, because I’m seeing the same signs as I saw in myself years ago, in her. I just want things to be okay, but they’re not getting better, they’re only getting worse. 
 
I’m sorry if this post is all over the place; I really have no understanding of what I’m feeling right now."

Anxiety,"Boredom, loneliness, and uncertainty about the future have brought back my anxiety and depression.","For some time I was feeling fairly well and hadn't experienced any major anxiety or depression.  However, the last couple of weeks have brought things back into full swing.  This weekend and last weekend, I haven't really gone anywhere and just stayed home.  I thought it would be relaxing just to sleep in and not do anything.  However, I noticed myself getting feeling anxious and getting really depressed.  I then realized that I haven't left the city for nearly a month.  It was made worse by the fact that my wife was gone this weekend to visit one of her friends.  Then there has been the stress of CoVid and the US election.  But most of all, it's the uncertainty about the future.  I mentioned in [another forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/jfxqxq/i_want_to_do_a_career_change_but_im_afraid_that/) that I'm wanting to return to the US and get out of English teaching.  (I teach English in South Korea.) However, I don't know the first thing about changing career paths or where to look.

Anxiety,Anxiety and guilt,"I’m in my 30s, female and diagnosed with GAD. 
Recently I have been feeling guilty about *everything* and I mean everything. I will consider calling someone and then not get round to it and feel so guilty even though the person I was gonna call has no idea I had planned to call them.

I read a magazine and threw it away and then spent the rest of the day feeling guilty that my mum could have read it (she probably wouldn’t have!). I’m moving house and feeling guilty about leaving the old people who live next door as we sometimes shop for them etc. 

It got to the point where my dad asked if I wanted something and I said no thanks I don’t need it and then almost called him back to say I’d take it anyway just so I didn’t have to say no?

I think I definitely have some issues about people pleasing and never wanting to let anyone down even though the things I feel bad about are things most people wouldn’t think twice about.

It’s getting ridiculous now I spend half my time worrying ive disappointed someone or done something wrong. Anyone else feel this way?"
Anxiety,Residual feelings of guilt,"I’ve (23F) been reflecting on the past few months, and I find that there’s some lingering guilt on actions I’ve taken that I’m not proud of, but I know have helped me at the time. I unraveled, in the sense that I overshared some things about a breakup I was going thru for the sake of feeling better, at the expense of the privacy of the other person (27M). We have since worked through it and have slowly found our way back to each other, and we’re both in a much better place. The only thing that holds me back from embracing this new chapter is the fact that I’m not happy with the fact that I overshared to try to make sense of what happened. Problem is a few of the people I’ve spoken to are mutuals, and one is a cousin, whom my significant other will probably meet at some point. It makes me feel guilty because we were otherwise a very elusive and private couple, and I’ve unnecessarily given people knowledge to create prejudices in their head about someone they don’t know at a personal level. He’s a private person in general, and although he isn’t hiding our relationship, he doesn’t see the point in sharing things about our private life. So do I. But I truly was losing it at the time, all I wanted to do was vent. I’m a private person too, but I just couldn’t hold it in any longer.
I occasionally speak to a therapist, and she emphasized that a lot of what I’m feeling or what I felt at the time had to do with me being in a strong trance of anxiety. I might get over it at a point, but it sort of comes back. It’s a recurring anxiety I have, and it manifests itself in the form of guilt. Anxiety is very common among a lot of people, so this might resonate with some of you. I think about things a lot more than I should. It’s not easy for me to let go of something because I always worry about how it’s going to be received or how every one of my actions have consequences and I’m very hard on myself because I’ve always been someone who did very little to jeopardize a situation, for fear of being blamed, but this year was a difficult one for me on the mental health side of things, like most people. I’m sure a lot of people have something to say about how this year has affected their mental health. I basically unraveled and lost all sense of discipline in the one situation I valued and was very careful about. 
I know this might sound like such a non-issue to a lot of you and I would appreciate it if some of you decided to knock some sense into me about that, if you do see it that way. At the same time, I don’t want my actions to downplayed as I find it helpful to also be held accountable.

I used to use the Smiling Mind app which worked for me so I might go back to using that too."
Anxiety,"Everything is going to be ok, I promise!","If you're reading this, please don't give up. Never give up. The odds may feel stacked against you, but there is still hope. I developed a chronic health issue (along with different mental health issues) when I was 15 where I have a hard time controlling my gag reflex and spend almost every morning throwing up. It's exhausting and I've considered taking my own life over it since it has made me feel so limited in what I can achieve, but I have to remember how extremely fortunate I am to be in this position and how many other people are in situations that are far worse. I know that seems like a simple concept, but it's the truth. There are so many people out there with terminal illnesses whose days are numbered, and all they can do is cherish the days they have and make the most of it. That taught me a big lesson that no matter what the odds are that you're dealing with, you can find peace within acceptance. So when you roll out of bed in the morning, ask yourself: Will I choose to be happy today? Or do I choose to let my struggles dictate and control how I perceive myself and the world around me? So next time the odds feel like they're falling down on you, focus on what you DO have control over and maybe say a small prayer or think good thoughts for those who might be having a harder time. Hope this helps someone."
Anxiety,Anxiety because of school,"I live in the Netherlands and I am currently in high school doing A levels. I failed last senior year so I has to redo it and now I am still failing so much.

Anxiety,DAE get shakes when anxious but it feels like you can control it?,Like sometimes I shake my head or arms or legs but it always feels like it's my choice.

Anxiety,I think I have anxiety,"For the past few months I’ve noticed myself being a lot more judgemental, spending much more time on social media and I’ve realised I’ve become socially anxious. I am a 6 foot tall girl, I’m very pretty; I paint, pole dance and model and for my age, that makes me stand out. I’ve lost a lot of self worth seeing how people view my friends and how they’re admired and how I feel I am not. Especially online and parties ect I don’t feel I receive love and recognition like they do, (I shouldn’t even compare what I receive to what anyone else receives, this is something I am trying to practice and actually writing this thought down, I realise this is an unhealthy view but I just don’t know how to deal with it.) I feel the need for outsourced validation at the moment, I’ve been doing affirmations and stuff for myself but I think at this point in time I need more realisation within rather than affirmations. When I go to parties I usually am dressed up, I dance a lot but I do get anxious to talk to those who I’m not close with. I know so many compare themselves to me and it doesn’t make me feel flattered, it makes me feel insecure and anxious because when people look at me I feel it’s in comparison or even jealousy not admiration or appreciation, even some friends. I don’t know it’s a stressful situation and it’s stopping me from enjoying myself. Even at smaller parties or “seshes” I feel uncomfortable and/or anxious like I stand out or like I’m being awkward."

I have extremely rare but also severe problem. I have contacted psychiatrist and therapists but they werent even able to undestand me correctly. Im describing it here in desperate hope that maybe youve heard about something similar and know how to deal with it. 

I have terrible depression (including suicidal thoughts) caused by philosophical ideas such as solipsim, brain in the vat, simulation hypothesis etc. Everybody heard about them in one way or another and even if such thoughts seem to be disturbing everybody are able to quickly forget and continue their life normally. I cannot. The possibilities coming from them have put me in psychological hell, difficult to endure. 

I have firstly understood that there's no way to determine if we are not living in some simulation many years ago. It was a shock to me but i have managed to ignore that fact and live further. Such thoughts have been returning periodically to me in the episodes of something like OCD. I could not stand idea that not only i cannot be sure if this is the reality but also that there is not even a single theoretical being able to prove that. Such thought has been giving me the feel of absolute despair and hopelessness. It was already terrible but later even worst ideas have been invading my mind: what if im only some artificial ming in an artificial world created only to be tormented? what if in the very next second i will be put in some kind of surreal torture only because creator of such simulation decided that out of a boredom. I'm not able to disprove that possibility and i cannot stand it.

Between such episoded i was able to live normally, episodes have been passing naturally. But the thoughts have returned last week and it's far worse than ever. Im in the state in constant hopelessness and paranoic fear which causes nearly phisical pain. Those feeling are so horrific that i cannot prevent myself from considering suicide. I just want this torment to cease.

Worst thing is that i dont have classical mental illness. I have never had hallucinations or similar symptons. I'm simply afraid that people are equipped with some kind of the natural defence mechanism against such thoughts which im lacking. Im taking sertaline but i'm afraid it will be not enough. 

Maybe you have heard about something similar. I would like some miracle to happen and let me live normally but im afraid that it's not possible."
Anxiety,Political commitment with anxiety?,"I suffer from (social) anxiety and I am unable to participate in protests. However, I feel the need to support the antifascist movement but I don't know how to do that without triggering my anxiety? Does someone have a similar feeling?

It's like I really want to help make a difference and I feel obligated to but I am so anxious and even just reading about the things happening that are against my political beliefs triggers my anxiety.

I hope someone has an idea of what I could do."
Anxiety,Episodes of Intrusive Thoughts,"This post might contain triggers.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, I'm quite new to Reddit. Recently I've been having intrusive and unwanted thoughts of existentialism. These thoughts and intrusions have been followed by deep sadness and a disconnected feeling from reality. Lately, these episodes have been getting worse and worse. I have no dread of reality and the future so I'm not sure where these episodes are stemming from. 

I am going to seek help from a therapist and possibly a psychiatrist, but  I want your guy's opinion on the matter. To see if anyone experiences the same thing as I do.

Listed down below is a journal I wrote from my latest episode. There are many grammatical errors because I was typing down as I was thinking. This is to give you an insight into the types of thoughts I experience during an episode.

I feel as if I'm detached from myself, reality, friends, and family. I know people can understand me and want to help me but at the same time, i don't know why they should. Why do we feel emotions like we do why were we evolved to gain self-consciousness there's no meaning behind being self-aware yet here we are. Detachment from reality I often experience but I remember the episodes. They come through floods of thoughts that don't have any deceptive meaning behind them. They aren't words they are feelings and emotions, level of consciousness. I understand so much but at the same time nothing. I will learn i would love and i would live, there are so many aspects in life i will never end up exploring and so many places i never visit. So many skills i won't learn and so many problems i won't solve. Life's meaning is life itself, existence means nothing and because of that means everything. Life being a cycle you never truly know how to live until you die. There is no reasoning behind why society exists or why we exist. I love God and I believe in him, however, I just have this compulsion of me wanting to understand ""why?"" I've thought so much that I can only think of thoughts themselves, which is precisely what Alan Watts warned will happen. Similar to life I go through a cycle of thoughts. It usually stems from a moment in my past that said moment can be a random encounter I had with a store clerk, but it will flow to me questioning the existence of the store clerk and the world itself. These thoughts race through my mind in mere seconds, as I don't perceive it through words I perceive it through feelings and emotions that I could interpret. It makes me disassociated with reality and myself as I do not understand how I can interpret emotions into words or why these emotions occur in the first place. I'm afraid of my questions being answered as life itself is based on mystery and evolution. The point of life as i said is to be alive but to be alive means to explore, learn, etc. Without the art of discovery, there is no meaning left in life. This journal works as a transcript for what I am currently experiencing as to put my mind at ease. There is an end to it all, an end to life, an end to civilization, when that occurs couldn't be of less importance to me. As everything that occurs has already occurred. The sense of past present and future is a baseless concept as we all live in all three. The present is a misinterpretation of our minds trying to rationalize our existence. These episodes I'm having are similar as it's my mind working to rationalize my questions and my existence. Without there being things in the world that are irrational there will never be things rational."
Anxiety,Will we ever become normal again?,"I went to a party last night. Derealization was too strong and I realized nobody understood what I was saying, I couldn’t speak. Was completely sober, sounded like Ozzy Osbourne. I had a massive panic attack after that, had to leave. On my way home I legitimately thought that I was in Hell. 
I get so sad thinking back to the person I used to be. I had no fears, I was so confident and could stay out all night talking to people and drinking like a normal person. I had so much fun... I loved meeting new people and being lost in a big party. Had never experienced derealization, always felt present. 
Now I can barely leave my house. 
The panic attacks are too intense.

Anxiety,Continuous tightness in the chest opposed to occasional tightness,"A few months ago my body tensed up and I've had tightness in my chest and neck ever since, no pain fortunately. I instinctively knew it wasn't heart related since it seemed like a surface/muscle issue. Knowing it was anxiety related (I've had just about every symptom accompanying it) and an ER trip confirming nothing was wrong, I've endured and coped with the tightness for 3 months.

It's still not fun. It still plays with your mind. As a follow up to that ER visit, I'm going to get a stress test and a heart electrocardiogram, to (a) ease my conscience, and (b) eliminate anything heart related. I have a question though. While occasionally reading this subreddit, I noticed that chest/tightness seems to come occasionally whenever there's a panic or anxiety attack. Does anyone actually have chest tightness 24/7?"
Anxiety,i feel like such an awful partner,"i get concerned over how quickly my partner can get jealous or paranoid. i know that they like to exaggerate sometimes in the name of humour but there's something sincerely insecure about it underneath that makes me feel uncomfortable because i know that it's not healthy. i feel like i can't really compliment people even as passing comments and it's starting to really annoy me enough that i can't really hold it all in and i feel awful about being petty in those times because they know all this too, they know this isn't healthy either. i know that they struggle with anxiety a lot too but it really bothers me that they insist there's never a time to talk about this properly. on one hand i know that this is so much and so unhealthy but on the other i get so frustrated with myself that i just can't be patient enough. this is a person i genuinely love and care for and who has made my life feel so much fuller and i can't even remind myself to be gentle sometimes, to be a little more patient, to be that one constant in their life when everything feels so draining and overwhelming. i know this whole situation is hard and that we're both struggling but if i weren't such a shitty partner i wouldn't be dragging us down any further"
Anxiety,Crippling Sunday Night Anxiety Before Work,"I hate the feeling of dread/panic when it’s Sunday night and the countdown starts before I go back to work tomorrow. Something about transitioning back to work after a relaxing weekend makes me feel on edge.

It takes a toll on me not just mentally but emotionally, so whenever I go through a nice weekend where I don’t have to feel that emotional drain, all of a sudden I experience this crippling anxiety about ‘having to do it all again tomorrow’. I’m already thinking about the tasks I need to complete in a fast paced environment.

Anxiety,I just have a quick question. I have had social anxiety and this hasn't been helping even if part of it is hypothetical.,I didn't take care of my teeth when I was younger and after 3rd grade never went to a dentist and my teeth are bad. It has always made me even more nervous and I am worried I'm going to not have any at a younger age. I always panic when I think about it and just want to here an opinion from non family members and I currently don't have any friends. If that's the case do you think I would be ridiculed or looked down upon by others?
Anxiety,Does anybody else have severe problems with irrational thoughts and fears?,"Hello :) I’m a 24 yr M, I have had anxiety and on/off depression for the last two years. Something I struggle with is irrational thoughts/fears come into my mind and start to wear on me. I know these thoughts are false, but I keep picturing worst-case-scenarios and endless ""what-ifs"". 
Some examples from the last year:

- I thought that my friends don’t like me and they only hang out with me because I’ve known them for so long and they can’t just get rid off me now. Sometimes I would even isolate myself from my friends because I thought that they didn’t want me around. When they started texting because they were wondering where I was, I thought that it was just to be nice, not that they actually missed me... I also thought that I was acting stupid when I drank alcohol and annoyed people. After a while I actually told them about these thoughts, and they said that it’s not true. Some even said that they have had the same thoughts about themselves.

- I read an article about parasomnia; things people do in their sleep. I read about people walking out of their house, making food and even taking a shower in their sleep. Some days after I slept over at my female friend’s house. Everything was cool and all, I left the day after to go to school. Then my mind remembered the article and I started thinking ""what if you touched her or tried to kiss her in your sleep?"". I feel asleep first and woke up from her alarm.  I honestly don’t know where this thought came from, It has never happened to me before, and I had a girlfriend for 3 years that I slept next to 100s of times+I’ve slept next to probably 30 girls without anything happening. I just got really freaked out, even tho I know it didn’t happen. She even said the day after that she thought it was nice of me to stay the night because she was lonely that day.

-I did coke a couple weeks ago at a party(stupid), then I got really paranoid the week after and I almost convinced myself that the coke had made me bipolar. I don’t know why or where this thought came from, but for a week I was freaking out because of this and googling symptoms and so on for bipolar disorder.

- Small thing: I got scared that I had eye cancer for a while because I had a lot of floaters in my vision. 

Does anyone else experience these irrational ""what-ifs"" and random thoughts that just take over your mind? Why does this happen and how do I deal with this? It’s making me really uncomfortable and my anxiety is bad because of this atm. 

Thanks for any answers :)"
Anxiety,I don't like lying. How do you feel about it?,"I wouldn't describe myself as ""honest"" and it would be a lie itself that I don't lie at all but the idea of lying and being lied upon sickens me. My mum told me how little lies are needed for social interaction since when I was a kid but I almost always refused to do it.

I've read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad few months ago and it describes exactly how I feel about it.

&gt;You know I hate, detest, and can’t bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies—which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world—what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. 

Anyways I was forced to make some excuse recently and it makes me feel dizzy."

Anxiety,Getting high anxiety and getting into my head,Hi guys. I just needed some enlightenment on how to help prevent getting in your head or ways to calm that anxiety that kicks in heavily. I find myself in situations where I so strongly believe a few people don’t want my presence and I convince myself of that. I get so angry and I make it blatantly obvious but they get so frustrated because that’s simply not the case. I just can’t take the anxiety of being a burden anymore. I’m someone who cannot be alone for long periods but when I get in this headspace I believe I deserve to be alone and that I need to just disappear somewhere completely cut off from the world. Not in the sense of suicide but complete isolation. Sometimes I really just hate myself for letting that side of my anxiety show and let that go onto the people in my life. It’s completely irrational but I can’t find a way to block it.
Anxiety,Need your help getting out of my head,"Oh anxiety, the bane of my existence at the moment. And I really need your help getting me out of my own head.

Brief history: emotional abuse by a parent. Constant yelling and telling me I'm not good enough, I'm an embarrassment, they hope I have kids like me so I know what they went through, etc. Experience depression as a kid, and more severely as a teenager and adult. At 18, fell in love with a classmate from first grade. He did not treat me nicely. It was long-distance and he got married within a year of our breakup (after dating for 8 years). Took time to move on but had some issues in my life and couldn't stay in the country I grew up in. Found love in another country, and had 3 years of a difficult marriage. He was unstable, and as was I. We broke up 3 years ago.

Now: living alone. Saved up by myself and bought an apartment. Just got a promotion at work, and have a few good friends.

Since the pandemic, I've faced my worst fear of being completely alone and although I am proving to myself that I can do it, my anxiety has attacked me to no extent.
My neck muscles feel permanently twisted into knots. I sit on my couch watching TV, feeling paralyzed by it. I am exhausted in the day, but can't sleep to save myself at night. I've been meditating, reading, trying to exercise, stretching, etc but I can't shake it off. I've tried EFT Tapping but the relief lasts about 5 minutes.

My eczema has flared to new levels, and I'm too embarrassed to go out because of it. But I'm lonely and sad and overwhelmed, and can't find any relief.

Any words of wisdom or support (even if it's tough love) would be much appreciated. I just feel I've gone so deep into my head that I've lost my way out. I'm usually a positive and strong person, but I feel I've lost my spark.

Thank you Reddit community. "
Anxiety,The Pill That Helped Me A Ton. And Guess What.. It's Free,[removed]
Anxiety,Need some advice,"My wife has bouts of anxiety, fairly often, maybe 4-6 times a year. When it happens, she loses her sh**, throws everything to the ground and starts hyperventilating and having a breakdown (not sure how else to describe it). 

Our current method is that is stick with her, stop her from hurting herself (digging in nails, scratching)and try to calm her down. I try to distract her by telling her to focus on her breathing and try to distract her (talking about nothing). It varies from 3 minutes to an hour"
Anxiety,What kind of involuntary movement is this?,"What kind of involuntary muscle movement is this?

A **single**, brief and short thug in a single muscle, that elicits a brief and short movement in legs, hands, back, shoulders or whatever. It surprises you and, when you try to reproduce the same movement on purpose, you notice you're now activating multiple muscles, instead of the single one that's just fired by itself.

Would call it a **twitch** or a **jerk**? Or else?

Does anyone have it similar independant of anxious attacks?

How to they feel to you?

I do have general anxiety and health anxiety and I've had it for two years now. A few months ago I started to have nervous system symptoms (first tremors, then vibrations, then full-blown pain and pins-and-needles) and now these... ticks. They prevent me from falling asleep sometimes. And, with nervous problems, I'm afraid it's being caused by something else and nasty."
Anxiety,On stuttering...,"Imagine if you will two short scenarios... 

One is a life where you're living with daily anxiety. Anxiety that was so bad you stutter when you speak - among other unpleasant and tiring feelings, quirks, coping mechanisms and moods that come with the territory - a viciously exhausting and seemingly neverending cycle of stuttering because you have anxiety and your anxiety getting worse because you're stuttering. So as a result you hardly can speak more than a couple sentences at a time. Short, sweet and to the point, no stumbling over words. But even so, you try as fucking hard as you can to be a normal 'human'. Regardless of the overwhelming pressure and nausea that follows lengthy conversations, you constantly force yourself to go out of your comfort zone 'where you grow' at the cost of consistent panic attacks due to the addrenaline rushes from severe spikes in anxiety. 

Now imagine being someone who mocks a person because they stutter over a few words. Imagine being the person who makes someone feel as though they would rather just never speak out loud again. The person (or even one of the people) that someone sees in the back of their mind ••• when their throat locks ••• and they're no longer able to hold a conversation ••• as they feel their mouth fumbling over a simple word ••• a word a young child can say without hesitation. Imagine that being one of the memories that someone associates you with. Imagine someone thinking of you and a pang of panic and shame stings them. All so you could get a quick giggle/addrenaline rush; a moment that you'll probable never even think of again. 

That person in the second scenario? Don't be that person. Please never be that person. It's literally free to not do that. 


Just a reminder to be kind to those around you."
Anxiety,Can panic dissorder lead to impulse phobia (ocd) ?!,"I noticed something weird during my panic peiodes, when i'm really low on energy and depressed i get flashes, ideas of doing somthing stupid like jumping in the sea when i'm near it or jumping out the window when home.

Anxiety,"Feeling isolated, insomnia, waking up with clenched fists and dizziness all day","Hey all, like many of you this year has been extremely tough for me!

I have been very isolated since March. No job and feel like a prisoner in my own house. I feel like I am losing all my friends and have no real close connections. I was also unlucky to go through a breakup at the start of the year. I have never felt such loneliness and social isolation.

Things don't seem to be getting better, it has been grey and raining for days where I am and we are going into quarantine.

Over the past few weeks I have started to develop dizziness constantly (like being on a boat) and also I am incapable of sleeping more than five hours. I have no problem falling asleep but I always wake up around 3-4AM. I am waking up almost in a panic with really clenched fists and tight arms. I have no idea why as I do meditation and am relaxed when I go to sleep. Before I was dizzy, I was going for walks and doing exercise, now I feel incapable due to the dizziness. It is also hard to read or look at any screen. I am monitoring my water intake and eating well also.

I will visit a doctor this week but does anyone have any advice for dealing with this?"
Anxiety,noise and touch sensitivity,"is it normal to be really finicky/sensitive about stimuli? esp noises and touch? i don't know if this is a symptom of my anxiety or maybe I'm just too sensitive ;; 

for example, if i start feeling a blanket is not sitting on me right or my shirt isnt sitting right on my shoulders, or that my hair is annoying, i literally feel my heart rate increase and start feeling physically anxious. i have to fix it and if i can get it to feel *right* i only start getting increasingly upset.

another really bad one is noise. whenever my dog starts to bark i jump really bad, my heart starts racing and I'll almost immediately be on the verge of tears. even smaller noises like someone coughing, videos playing from someone's phone, etc. if my brain decides it's out of place or distracting i find myself getting mad??/upset so quickly and i have to put on my headphones to drown it out. 

I've noticed these feelings gets 2000x worse if I'm in the middle of a panic attack or am on the brink of one. every single sensation becomes really disstressing and overwhelming :/

i ask because i feel like it's actually been taking away from my daily life recently and I've been thinking about it a lot. i have no clue if this is a normal symptom of anxiety, and when i google it i get a lot of results about actual sensitivity as in the ability to process sound.



tl;dr: i am very sensitive when it comes to touch and sound, stimuli i don't like makes me anxious, sometimes overwhelms me, and puts me in a horrible mood. is this a symptom of my anxiety? does anyone else deal with this?

Anxiety,"Need advice, newly pregnant","So, long story short — I stopped taking medication last year and felt totally fine for about a year, but then I started having some troublesome thoughts that have caused muscle tightness which has led me even deeper into rumination and my habit of having anxiety about my anxiety... 

My husband does not really agree with medication and that’s what prompted me to stop one year ago. I just found out I’m 7,5 weeks pregnant. I talked to my OB and she prescribed me the same medication assuring me it was safe and the risks were very minimal and wouldn’t cause any permanent damage for the future baby.

My husband got SO ANGRY with me and feels that I’ve lied to him for the past year because I said I would “try” to stop medication. He also thinks I have an addiction to this medicine...which doesn’t really make sense to me. I just don’t want to spiral down to a bad place while I’m pregnant and I just don’t think he sees it that way. He is in denial that I’ve really ever experienced severe anxiety in my life (OCD/anxiety/depression).... is he right to be angry about this?"
Anxiety,Is workplace bullying common ?(23F),"



I recently did an internship on a tv set as a production assistant. My managers gossiped about me behind my back, would scream in my face and call me a stupid b*tch end if I didn't do something right away and precisely correct, I would be yelled at more. I was venting to my friend Audrey about it, and she was very unsympathetic.




She told me it was my fault for that happening to me because im awkward and shy. She worked years in production, and she said she would bully the insecure production assistance and the culture of it was normal. She says that if her assistants were not perfect, she would embarrass them and make it known they were worthless. She says I need to grow up. Is workplace bullying normal? Does workplace bullying happen a lot?



tl;Dr: I was venting to a friend about getting harassed at work, and she rolled her eyes at me and told me it was my fault. She also said workplace bullying was typical and accept it."
Anxiety,Public panic attack at hairdressers ... worth explaining myself ?,"Public panic attack due to being triggered. Is it worth explaining why ?

Is it a bad idea to tell someone what happened ?

Weird story. To summarise 
- my dad got really mad at me when I was younger for no reason so held me down and cut off a significant proportion of my hair because he knew I loved my hair so wanted to punish me (#Normal #Tranquil #NotAtAllTrailerTrash #WeAreNotWhiteTrashOhWait ...  )
- developed fear and massive anxiety of haircuts for years and grew my hair out super long like past my butt
- I started getting haircuts with a guy I trust because  I was looking really ugly. Over  a  year ago I got a big haircut ( like 10 inches off) my hair was still long but normal long 
- I told this man how much to cut off and he grabbed the scissors and literally cut it off all at once without warning me. Although I asked him to do this, this is like what my dad did so it threw me into a public panic attack. Can you imagine how embarrassing that was. Sure you can. I started to freak out and was shaking and basically came across not only really in an odd way, but really rude. Objectively, it is pathetic to be freaking out about a haircut . I came across  like I didn’t like it, but that was not the case, I was just not able to think straight because of what previously happened. I really loved my hair and was very grateful to this man. Just did not come across that way. 
- I have never come across so badly and spoilt in my life and although this event happened more than 1 year ago, it still haunts me and causes me severe anxiety. I wrote an apology email (lol cringe kill me now ) and saw this hairdresser again before the pandemic and apologised to him and made a joke about how I was shocked to look less homeless and that’s why I was freaking out. 
- i need to get another haircut and I’m thinking about telling this guy the real reason why I was scared of haircuts. He does not know because it’s awkward to tell someone “my dad cut off all my hair for shits and giggles Lo!Lz "" but the thing is, I want to because I want to explain  why I came across as rude and panicked and why I was scared of haircuts because let’s be honest .... it’s really odd.  He knew I was scared of haircuts but I told him it was because I got a bad haircut once (which is not exactly a lie ) 
- but at the same time, I feel like it’s a potentially bad idea that I will live to regret and cause me a lot of self hatred and “why the fuck did I think it was a good idea to tell this man that, what the fuck is wrong with me, I need professional help (which is true, but regardless) I should Kill myself etc” 
- obviously I won’t tell him it was my dad who cut it off but someone ... to try and make things less awkward ... but it’s just very uncomfortable to admit you know. My best friends do not even know. When I had short hair I just said I cut it myself. Because it’s very shameful to say my dad cut off my hair. 

Or is it better to swallow my pride and ego and just come across like a pathetic freak who is scared of haircuts. Hmmm. Advice welcome :)"

Anxiety,Can you guys please tell me if this sounds completely nuts or a kind of reasonable fear? (SERIOUS REPLIES ONLY),"What I would like with this post is for you guys to tell me, HONESTLY, whether what follows could be considered exaggerated fear/anxiety or legitimate psychotic paranoia. Please respect my request for honesty as I'm in a lot of distress right now. 

Basically, I was on holiday with my father, stepmother and two brothers, who are still kids. We went out to a bar for a meal. Sitting on a table very close to us there was a man sitting by himself. He was clearly a bit odd; he was talking to himself a bit and was moving his phone up and down erratically. He also looked odd and was dressed in a strange way, but I know it's unfair to judge people based on this. At one point I got up to go to the toilet, and when I came back he was making unsolicited conversation with my dad and stepmum. They were clearly a bit on edge for the rest of the meal. After my dad asked for the bill the man got up and left, but when we went to leave five minutes later, he was standing in the doorway of the bar. My dad and brother simply walked past him, but I actually asked him, ""Are you coming in?"" He replied that he'd forgotten his COVID mask. We then walked into the side street where our house was, I glanced behind me and the man was walking behind us. At that moment I thought, SHIT, this is actually going down. However, he eventually crossed the road and went into a kebab house. My dad and stepmum were also glancing over their shoulders. I ruminated about this for the rest of the night, considering the possibility that he WAS following us and decided to retreat at the last minute. Maybe he'll try and break in later? I thought. He easily could've seen us open the door of our house. I wasn't convinced of this by any means; I simply entertained the possibility. However, I did entertain it enough to push one of the beds in my room against my door; I was afraid to sleep without doing this. I also considered getting a knife from the kitchen just in case, though I didn't do this in the end. 

Thanks for reading (and for any replies in advance)."
Anxiety,I just realized how much effort I put into being better and how draining it is,"Hey there. 

I (F23) have anxiety and depression, 5 years and counting.
3 therapists, 3 physiatrists, more medicines than I can count, skin issues, endless nights awake.

I've tried so many years to ""get out"" of depression and anxiety that I realized that I'm drained. I put way to many efforts into this, and the results are not as bright as I would like to. Doing a meditation today I came to the realization that I can take a day off in trying to get out of this. A permission to be sad and anxious and not trying to fix myself desperately. 

The worst thing about it is that I think all this effort traduced in more anxiety and depression, due to the fact that I'm not getting much better.

I think is important that sometimes we take a step back and look at anxiety or depression as a separate thing. As a condition. As something out of our total control.

Hope you are having a great day. I'm taking the day off."
Anxiety,Is anyone else just feeling anxious constantly at the moment?,"Normally my symptoms and anxiety are manageable, and I’ve done a lot of work to get there. As much as I have some bad day sometimes, they seem to be constant at the moment, which is probably symptomatic of all of the restrictions due to COVID and being stuck in the house, and not being able to do anything I want to be able to do. But just at the moment all my symptoms are horrible and doing the simplest things even feels like a struggle. Anyone else?"
Anxiety,Anxious of upcoming surgery,"I am getting my wisdom teeth out this week, I don't know if that is actually considered ""surgery"" but I have never been put under before and that is where most of my anxiety is coming from. I think most of my anxiety stems from the fact of not being ""in control"" and not knowing the actual outcome,  I always look up stats and it always says there is like 0.001% chance of something going wrong and not to worry but I usually worry when it's not 100% chance of nothing going wrong. I also was looking up stuff to try and ease my mind about the surgery and then accidentally find articles like ""Teen dies from 'routine' wisdom teeth surgery"" and that just freaked me out even more. Any suggestions of how to get through this?"
Anxiety,Buspar headache,"Hey all: I am have been on Buspirone for nearly 10 days -- 10 mg at night to see how I am affected.  I am supposed to add 10 mg in the morning in a few days. I feel a slight improvement but I do know this drug takes a while. I don't know if the drug is giving me headaches but it is likely that it it is because they come on at night. So my sleep is not great. My doc says she believes most of the side effects go away. This drug won't be doable for me if it doesn't. So, I am just going to hang in there but I am wondering for how long?"
Anxiety,Meditation with anxiety and racing thoughts ?,"So I’ve been struggling with multiple mental illness diagnosis for a long time, that causes horrible anxiety, racing thoughts and flashbacks. At this point it’s constant, 24/7. And I’ve tried just about everything. I’m on 4 different psych meds. 
But I was wanting to try meditation to slow down my thoughts. I just don’t know where to start. I have no idea how to meditate, especially when I can never clear my brain. 
Can someone help me and maybe give me some tips for meditation with anxiety. Thank you in advance."
Anxiety,Cures for Anxiety Nausea?,"Hello all. My anxiety makes my stomach super sensitive, to the point where I throw up at the drop of a hat. Does anyone have any remedies for this? Obvi nothing is gonna straight up get rid of it, but any and all advice will be appreciated. 

I’ve tried: Pepto Bismal, omeprazole, metoclopramide, salty foods (to absorb stomach acid), eating bland foods. Actually, what I have found to be the most helpful is chewing mint gum. 

Thanks for the tips!"
Anxiety,Will shortness of breath go away?,"I apologise as I know this question has been asked plenty of times but I’m really frustrated. It’s scary at worst and annoying at least as I have to concentrate super hard when taking deep breath. I have to pause my Netflix show every few minutes to do this. 

I don’t have COVID symptoms or any other pain so I think it’s related to anxiety (I have been quite stressed &amp; anxious more than usual lately). I’m mid 20s female and just a lil bit overweight but been taking walks in the park to mediate this. Maybe it’s the sudden exercise? Although it’s just walking...

I can’t go to GP or A&amp;E as 1) I don’t want to put pressure on staff if it’s anxiety only 2) I don’t think they will see me. But like I said, I don’t have other pain so I think it’s anxiety.

Tldr: been having MAJOR shortness of breath for a few days now, will it go away or permanent?"
Anxiety,"I don't even know what kind of anxiety this is, or if this will even make sense, but here's a stream-of-consciousness kinda thing about my day in an attempt to explain the way my dumb brain works.","Disclaimer: I know this probably sounds absolutely fucking crazy but I promise that I'm mostly functional and outwardly sane, and that this is a creative abstraction of the sort of racing thoughts I get on a day-to-day basis.

It's late and I'm lying down. I had a good day overall, went fishing early and only had a few sporadic episodes of thinking ""I'm starting to feel a little odd. Am I going to have a panic attack today or start to faint but I try not to think that way, so I blink hard, wipe my eyes, try to get back to the present. It happens a few more times but I enjoy myself. On the walk back I feel odd again, dizzy, nauseous, I think about DEATH. Drive home is uneventful, we talk about video games.

When I get home I shower and try to relax, but my mind goes to DEATH and I suggest going to lunch with my partner, I unplug my laptop in case my dogs decide to chew through my laptop cable and get electrocuted of something even though they've never shown interest in it. I suggest getting lunch to my partner and we get in the car and DEATH and I feel odd, my body doesn't feel right, what's wrong with it? I blink and rub my eyes again, I do that a lot to try to...what? Reset things. A nervous tic I guess, makes no sense. Why am I like this? I take medication, I go to my psych, I went to therapy. What if one of my episodes happened right now in the car on the way to lunch and everything just went white and slipped into DEATH and that was just the end of it?

Lunch is delicious and I feel mostly fine but my migraines/seizures/whatever the fuck they are have happened in restaurants before and it could happen here, and if it did happen it could be something worse. Just breathe. You're alright. I hold conversation but it feels automatic, like I'm not even thinking about the words before they leave my mouth, like the part of my brain responsible for conversation and my outward persona is separate and distinct from whatever the fuck this is. It's awful but being alone is so much worse.

When I was alone I keep myself occupied with school work or video games but my mind always goes to DEATH and what is wrong with me? I even notice my nervous tics when I'm alone. Internally some part of me groans, some part of me screams, some part of me wants to cry. Everything hurts and everything feels so awful and wrong and it's always going to be like this. I'm never going to get better, but at least outwardly I seem normal. How long will that work? What part of my mind will deteriorate first? If it's this bad in my early middle-age, how bad will it be with my old, addled, senile brain? Or will I even make it that long? Don't think about that. Breathe.

The rest of the day is uneventful and fine and mostly happy like everything else. I lie down and I feel weird and I try not to think about DEATH, I mean I can think about it superficially but try really hard to not engage with it, and think about the real inevitability of it, or think about the way that my life is slipping through my fingers while I'm lost in my own mind, like a labyrinth and the minotaur is DEATH don't think about that pay attention to something else but DEATH is there DEATH behind me and there's no escape from it or even the terror of the mere thought of it. Blink hard, breathe, but it's bubbling up inside like always, threatening to spill over; the pain, the fear of the pain, the sorrow of that fear, emotions spilling out and forming into more complex shapes that there are no names for. My consciousness scrambles through the grooves and ridges of my diseased brain until it, exhausted, collapses into sleep, and in that liminal space between thought and dream waits DEATH."
Anxiety,Medical anxiety after grocery shopping,"Yesterday, I had to go grocery shopping, and while the store was largely empty, everyone was wearing masks, I had on a sealed N99, and I stayed more than two meters away from everyone most of the time I was there, I _still_ have coronanxiety.

How do I convince myself to stop worrying?  I checked the risk profile using an app, and, based on crowding level, duration of visit, mask protocol, etc., contraction risk is estimated somewhere between 1 in 10^6 and 1 in 10^8 - but I am still panicking."
Anxiety,Losing eyesight (major anxiety),"
I  dont really know what this is, but my diet is really bad and it consists of fries and fast food. When I wake up every day my eyesight just fades into darkness for about 20 seconds, twice. I worry about this because ive read on Google about some going blind. 

I lie awake at night thinking about farm animals, escaping, dead, morbid things. My head drives me in a bad way. I have scalp dermatitis and it scare me. I can't get treatment for it in Hungary

I think about haunted things like goats. A controlled mindset and others too. Thought id just get it off my mind!"
Anxiety,Constantly worried about people's thoughts,"Throwaway account. I'm constantly thinking about other people and their opinions on everything. It has gotten so bad that I have a fake conversation with them in my head and I predict how their reactions will be. Whether it would be positive or negative. This has been a thing for years. I used to take xanax but that stuff never helped in the long term so I quit that and I don't want to take any more pills. I contribute this to my low self-esteem from being bullied for years from a ""friend"". He was my friend during lunch with other people but during gym, he would smash my head against a locker or choke me very often. I didn't want to fight him since he appeared nice during lunch and I left it at that. I wanted to get on his good side so I was anxious as to how he would react every day.


I am in my late 20's now and this happened in Jr. High. Deep down I know this is in the past but I cannot seem to shake the anxiety. I have spurts during random days where I do not feel anxiety. I have digged deeper and deeper into my past and I am certain this is where this has started. The anxiety just won't disappear. Anyone have any pointers or suggestions?"
Anxiety,Anyone just been sitting there when you think of a thought and then you get a wave of scared overwhelmed feeling stomach turning and a dropping feeling all over body and then it Goes,
Anxiety,Don’t give up!,"This is for anyone who is struggling and needs to hear this. Anxiety will never last forever, it only lasts for as long as you let it. If you do not mind, it does now matter. I have struggled with anxiety, now more than ever during quarantine, and i’m am just here to say i understand and i know this is the hardest thing it feels like we have ever gone through, but things will get better. Each day work on one thing, it can be eating, or just focusing on breathing for that day, but no matter what, do not lose hope, we are so much more than anxiety. Stay strong everyone"
Anxiety,What are your hacks for living with anxiety?,"Do you have any healthy, non-avoidant hacks for living with anxiety? For example, I like to arrive early to social gatherings because it gives me time to scope out the place and see people as they arrive. I still challenge this by not always arriving early, but it helps when I have to be somewhere even though I have a lot of anxiety about it."
Anxiety,I’m graduating in 7 months and I have no idea what I’m doing with my life.,"Today anxiety has overtaken me. It feels like a hot pit in my stomach and I can’t shake it and it’s never felt like this before. I graduate high school in June and I keep trying not to think about it and pushing it off.

My only somewhat plan is to not go to college and go into real estate, because college is a lot of money and it’s not needed for that. I know it’s super risky though even though it could be very profitable. 

My friends are all going to college and they can’t stop talking about it and it seems like they’re all silently judging me. Even my guidance counselor seemed to give me a look of disapproval for doing so. My parents didn’t go to college though and they haven’t helped me at all. I have no idea how to apply to college or anything anyway. I just want to cry.

My family was very poor when I was little and I don’t ever want to be poor again but I don’t want to be average either. I just don’t know what to do. I have no models for success, nobody to look up to. I feel like I’m gonna fail no matter what. I have a million assignments to do by tomorrow and my anxiety won’t let me do anything all morning.

I know probably nobody’s gonna read this but it was helpful visualizing my thoughts by writing them.

TLDR: I graduate this year, My parents didn’t go to college so I don’t know what I’m doing, I feel like all my friends are doing well but I’m gonna fail no matter what."
Anxiety,"Getting angry, enraged, or scared of situations and scenarios you’ve created in your head.","
I experience daily where I create a fictional scenarios and situations in my head then actually start to get angry. I hate it but I can’t control it and it gives me a panicky feeling."
Anxiety,Ugh anyone else out there gag/dry heave with anxiety/nervousness?,I swear I cant be the only one😫 it looks like it got worse this year
Anxiety,Constant embarrassment,"Hey! I’ve returned to school and since then my life has just been a re occurring series of embarrassing moments. I also tend to overthink aswell so that doesn’t help :( 

Two days ago in school we were having a debate and I kind of mucked up and everyone started laughing at me and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since (even my teacher gave me a wierded out look). Then that same day during my lunch break when I’m having a conversation with someone they cut me off to say, I’m not trying to be rude but I don’t even know your name. And yes this would have been fine if it wasn’t for the other ppl making it worse saying things like ouchh and that’s embarrassing etc. Then today someone texted me and mid convo they’ve just left me on read! Like wtf... then someone else viewed my story then left me on read too??? 

It just makes me feel like crap like I just want the ground to open up and swallow me type of crap. It makes me so annoyed with myself and I think I should just stop talking to avoid this but if anyone has any suggestions please let me know, any advice I’d appreciate."
Anxiety,Anxious of getting Anxious,"The most terrifying parts of a panic/anxiety attack for me is the physical sensations that come with it, fast heart rate till chest hurts, feeling too hot or too cold, shakes, and depersonalization/derealization intensifying.

It's so distressing to the point where 70% of my panic attacks are due to me worrying about getting another one, or being tired of having them.

How do you guys deal with this? What mentality helps with this type of anxiety"
Anxiety,Health Anxiety,"I get the worst anxiety when it comes to my health. I’m actually a fairly healthy person. But I come up with every worst case scenario when I find anything at all abnormal. And I think this is it. It’s terminal. I google everything and decide it’s the worst case scenario. Then I get panic attacks and anxiety over it, making me feel ill. Then I decide I need to see a doctor. Usually when I go to appointment everything is fine and nothing wrong at all. But what if something was really wrong one of these times? What if I have an incurable illness. I know this is hypochondria, but what are tips to work through the doom scenarios that play constantly in your head? How do you stop that thought process?"
Anxiety,Anxiety is coming,"It’s in my stomach working it’s way up. I feel the anxiety coming for me. I hope posting helps, but it won’t because nothing helps. It’s in my stomach like I got punched and my chest is sunken in. My arms are tired and I want to scream it away. I’ll be shaking soon"
Anxiety,Palpitation question,Does/Has anyone ever had heart palpitations 3 or 4 times in a row? Like 3 beats in a row that lasts a few seconds?
Anxiety,I'm heading towards a rough spot and I don't know how to stop it/handle it,"To make this as short as possible, I've had anxiety issues since I was 11 (am now 18) and been to therapy more times than I can count. I was in 50 % sickleave for 2 years and I was on antidepressants for 2 years until I got declared ""healthy"" or whatever in june. I had an amazing summer where I met my first boyfriend who's also really great but haven't seen me anxious in the slightest. 

   I now study 100% again which in itself is really really hard. I struggle to stay a whole day and there are even times where I take the bus to school to then take the next one home because I couldn't handle being there. 

   Having my first boyfriend is really wonderful and I love him, but I have a hard time adapting on how to handle my anxiety when another person is involved. Usually I isolate myself until it goes away and I can't really do that to him. He doesn't understand what my disorders (GAD and social anxiety) means which I totally understand! And I know I should explain but  I also don't want tell him the dark stuff because I don't want him to change what he thinks of me. He fell in love with the person I was in the summer, a bubbly, fun girl that seemed to never stop talking. And now I can barely get a word out sometimes. 

   My parents are starting to get worried, so are my friends. I know I can handle it but it's stressing me out and I should just talk to a therapist again but I don't want to because it costs money and I don't want to feel defeated (NOTHING WRONG WITH SEEKING HELP I JUST DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT THAT I NEED IT AGAIN). What should I do? My grades aren't slipping yet but I have no energy to study and everything just feels so overwhelming all the time. Like I can never catch a breath."
Anxiety,Have you ever felt like your anxiety has a silver lining?,"Hi guys - just found this sub today, and it’s great so far, seeing how common these things are and that I’m not alone or fucked up somehow... 

My anxiety has been really rearing it’s head recently, after several years of being more or less under control. I feel anxious about almost everything, even completely invented scenarios in my head like “what am I going to do if all my friends and family die or turn on me for some reason” or “what if I say something stupid and untrue in my sleep and my partner leaves me” (though typing those two examples out makes me feel really ridiculous 🤦🏼‍♀️)... anyway, I was feeling sorry for myself recently, and a little positive thought crept in. Because of my (less irrational) anxieties, I actually sometimes feel more prepared for certain parts of life. As I consider the worst case scenario in any situation, I will usually not be caught off guard. When I had a bout of anxiety about suddenly becoming destitute, I started saving money... I had anxiety about my appearance, so I started to look after myself some more. Don’t get me wrong, in a great many instances my anxiety has held me back and prevented me from doing things I would have liked - but it made me feel a little less shit thinking that every once in a while, I can use these lemons to make a small glass of lemonade.

Anxiety,Can anxiety make it seem worse than it is?,"My anxiety always try’s to tell me I have schizophrenia or dissociative personality disorder and Bipolar disorder and I always get anxious about it. I’m dissociating and I feel weird but I know that’s a common anxiety thing to happen but I always jump to the worse conclusion, I’m also wondering if anxiety makes it hard to speak sometimes, sometimes my words are jumbled and sometimes I just don’t know what to say at all. Idk I’m a little nervous"
Anxiety,EVERYTIME I THINK IM GETTING BETTER I GET A STUPID PANIC ATTACK AND THE ANXIETY GETS WORSE THAN EVER.,"I feel alone and like the people I tell about my anxiety and how it makes me feel think I’m crazy. I try so damn hard to just let it flow. But when my thoughts tell me I’m about the drop dead and I start feeling weird body sensations, why am I supposed to do?! I’m tired of this. 2.5 years of fighting with myself I hate it and the worst part is that I still can function just fine so everyone thinks I’m fine. IM NOT FINE."
Anxiety,Please help me remember that it does get better.,I’m struggling. I used to be a happy and upbeat person but 2020 has shattered me. The guy I thought I would marry cheated and broke up with me. I’m an educator and it’s really scary and challenging right now. I just feel so anxious all the time and I feel like it’s never going to end. I feel like I won’t experience joy again. Please remind me that I will and that this pain is temporary. It’s so tempting to use my eating disorder as a crutch but I’ve been in recovery for years and I know my heart wouldn’t react well to going through the strain of starving again.

Anxiety,Does anyone know if vaping causes your anxiety to get worse or does it calm you down?,"I'm just really stressed and lately I want to try vaping cuz I see my co workers do it, I've smoke weed in high school but I stopped shortly after.

Anxiety,Is it narcissistic or just anxiety?,"I am trying to do homework, and my grandparents keep saying that I'm not the only one struggling with it, and my dad said that when I think about myself its narcissistic. I'm not sure if I'm being narcissistic or just want to worry about myself for a bit? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"
Anxiety,Is my friend doing the right thing or am I just selfish,"I feel really anxious when talking to people. I often end up blocking them because I feel really anxious and I'm ready to do anything to get out of the situation. I never talk to anyone irl. I just can’t talk to people. I sometimes end up deleting all my social media just because I was talking to someone and it made me feel really anxious 

I have an online friend. I'm grateful for him because he forced me to talk when I just wanted to leave. Without him I wouldn't have anyone. And I sometimes feel comfortable talking to him but most of the time it just makes me feel really anxious. But he forces me to talk. He says I have to at least try everyday but I have tried to tell him that once I try and feel anxious again my whole day is ruined and I don't want that to happen everyday. I have tried to tell him that I can't talk to people. I have asked if we could make a compromise but he said no 

He doesn't allow me to go more than 2 days without talking and when I tell him that I feel really bad and I won't be able to talk for a while he keeps saying ""please talk please"" and it makes me feel like the worst person ever so I talk to him even though I don't feel comfortable. And whenever I ask why he forces me to talk he just says ""idk"". Like I dont think he understands how bad he makes me feel everyday. I have tried to tell him but he doesn't understand. I feel trapped and misunderstood 

I would just cut him off but he is my only friend and I'm so lucky to have a friend and I care about him and he is nice and caring and he is my friend after all. I don't want to lose him and sometimes he makes me smile and if I left him no one else would ever talk to me. I'm not someone people want to be friends with"

Anxiety,Does anyone else worry constantly about running water?,"I tried searching through previous posts and couldn’t find this specific topic.

For around 4 years now I have an obsessive worry about leaving water running in my house. Most specifically I am worried that I have left the tap on after washing my hands in the bathroom or kitchen. It has become quite a dominating feature of my life and my camera roll is filled with pictures of taps that have been turned off.

I have never, ever flooded a room or left a tap running in my life. I believe the anxiety comes from the thought that I will flood a room/building, cause damage, and be financially responsible for it and it will bankrupt me.

It has gotten to the stage where I will spend a very long time checking and double checking and taking pictures before I can leave a room or the house. I purposely use the bathroom before my partner at night time and ask him to check for me. We have discussed it and him indulging my anxiety isn’t healthy for either of us so I’ve stopped doing this.

Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, have you overcome or alleviated it in any shape or form?"
Anxiety,Buspirone or Lexapro and anxiety-induced hand tremor,"Has anyone had success with buspirone or Lexapro (or any other medication) for treating anxiety-induced hand tremor? My hands shake terribly. Sometimes I wear wrist weights around my house and this seems to help but obviously this is impractical most of the time. My hands shake whether I’m anxious or not, but it’s much much much worse when I’m experiencing anxiety and when this happens in public I get very self-conscious and this in turn makes me even more anxious."

F*ck i’m sorry i’m just panicing alot.

I don’t even know why it happened. Like i’m just really overthinking literally everything and can’t calm down and i’m just like crying again. 

How can i calm down quickly because i don’t want to go to school with being really anxious and people knowing that i have been crying.

Anxiety,A typical day of work goes like this agoraphobia and anxiety,"Anxiety all time high what do I do.

Biting them 24/7 nailed bit down as far as they can go, mouth bleeding from biting them. Can’t focus meds don’t do shit, pretty sure my family think I’m a actually a lazy pos. Everyone at work thinks I’m a joke, basically sure I suffer from extreme agoraphobia from bad experiences at work. Only tome I feel normal is when I’m at home on my computer playing games and listening to music. I can’t go in public for long periods of time or I feel anxious biting my fingers constantly chewing on my

Anxiety,Quarantine really has me messed up,"I’m 17.

I’ve had some slight anxiety in the past, but nothing major. I had my first anxiety attack a few weeks ago, because I was so nervous for my driving test. I couldn’t go to sleep at all and my heart was pounding. I honestly think that if everything was normal, I’d still be slightly nervous, but not nearly as nervous to stay up all night and not being able to sleep while being out of breath.

I really don’t want to feel like that ever again, and I think it’s all because of quarantine and my disconnect from the outside world. Any advice?"
Anxiety,Clingy/Jealous because of Anxiety?,"Does anyone else struggle with paranoid anxiety about their partners potentially cheating/losing interest/leaving you?

If you do, how do you deal with it? I generally remind myself that I am loved and it’s just the anxiety talking, but sometimes the tricky thoughts win and I verbalize my insecurity coming off kind of clingy...

Maybe it’s the right move to be transparent about this with my partner, but I don’t want to use my anxiety as an excuse to be toxic/jealous/clingy. 

Furthermore, as a guy I don’t want to come off as weak or broken to my partner. I realize this is maybe a silly fear to some but it’s a fear of mine nonetheless. She knows I have anxiety but I work hard to keep it from coming up.

tl;dr If your anxiety makes you want to be clingy/jealous towards your partner, how do you handle those feelings in a healthy way?"
Anxiety,anxiety sleeping at friends houses?,"ive always had this irrational fear about being the last one asleep. even as a kid, i remember telling my parents to stay up until i fall asleep- and it carried on as the years went by. now im 17 debating if i should go home at 3 am because i cant sleep. does anyone else get anxiety sleeping at other peoples houses? and if you do- how do you overcome it? if you dont, just leave any words of encouragement lol. thank you &lt;3"
Anxiety,Feeling very anxious because of relationships,"Hello guys! 

**Introduction**

A story about M23 and F20.

I wrote quite a long text trying to keep everything that I find important. I’m trying to write it so it would be easier to read and perceive, sorry if I fail in that. Please feel free to write your honest opinion, don’t worry that you can hurt me, I like to get a justified criticism. Thank you for any suggestions and feedback.  
Let’s call the country she lives – A, the country I live – B, and the country we visited – C.

**About me**

I am a 23M. Software engineer, good enough, spent all my childhood studying this area. After last year graduating got an offer from the top company I always dream to work in.  So moved from A to B. And working here for a year.

Had one ex in my entire life, there was a 4-years long relationship and it appeared she dated with two people at the same time for a few years. I think it affected my complexes a bit. We broke up a year ago.

**Keep in mind**

* Lockdown makes lots of things harder.
* I had only one girlfriend before and she cheated on me.  We didn’t live together.
* I have some health problems and I feel physically very bad when I worry a lot. So sometimes it is even hard to wake up after the quarrel.
* She says she is choleric and sometimes she can’t control herself — she feels guilty after shouting at me and so on. But she can shout for 5 minutes and feel good after that.
* On the opposite, I never shout at anyone, not very emotional but these quarrels affect me a lot. Even after a small one, I can worry the whole day.
* I have difficulties with choosing something. Food, flights,  hotels, toothbrushes, etc. I always feel too responsible to make it easy.

**Full story**

**Acquaintance.** I met her online in May,  she is from A. We had interesting conversations, I liked spending my time with her. We walked “together” sharing the videos. Then we started dating in June, it made sense for me since I really-really liked her, didn’t feel that for a long time.

Then I got sick and needed to have complicated surgery. She texted me all that time, said she was as sad as never before, cried so much. She also complained that she doesn’t know if she needs these relationships because she never met me but feels so bad for me. She tried to drink, spend more time with her friends, some of those stories hurt me but I was happy if she could feel better.  
After that I got fine, the surgery went good, I was a bit weak after that but healthy enough. So I decided to visit her in A. It was a hard flight because of lockdown, took me 20 hours to get there but I was finally fine, met her and my parents.

Before my arrival, she told me about another guy. He said that he loved her and asked her to marry him. She told me she doesn’t know what to do. She likes him, he is nice, has lots of money, can buy her a nice flat and car, they will have children in a few years,  she can easily spend his money, he would give her everything she wants. But she loves me. She discussed it with me, mother, friends. I said that I want to be with her and it’s painful to say but I want her to be happy. Friends and mother said she has to marry him because it is such a nice change and he lives in the same city. This situation made me feel awful. But she decided to be with me. I asked if she can stop talking to him because it makes me feel pain. She said ok, but it appeared he called her after that and asked to be with him a few more times.

When I moved I found a few friends here:  2 guys and 1 girl (let’s call her F). Both guys retired and I talked only to this girl. We are just friends for a year, never had anything, she had a boyfriend and I always supported her. But my girlfriend was jealous of her so I didn’t spend that much time with F as before. One time I was helping F to buy a bike my girlfriend met a random guy on the street who asked for her phone number, she agreed,  then they went for a walk together. This time I was jealous but she said if I can do that why she can’t.

After my arrival, we started living together.  It was good enough, I liked it. Cared a lot about her, my cooking skills are about 0 so ordered the food she likes, gifted her something she wanted, carried her. We had quarrels daily or something like that but they were small. There were a few large tho.

**Large quarrel #1.** On one of the first days of my visit my ex knew I was in A, she came to my home and we had a conversation: she asked to be with her again and so on, I replied that I have a new girlfriend I love, not blame the ex in anything but can’t date with her.

Two weeks after my girlfriend took my phone and read all the messages from her. I just archived the contact so didn’t see the messages but she still was able to send them. It appeared my ex wrote she is very sorry for everything, described her visit. I didn’t read the messages friendly speaking, my girlfriend asked to delete the whole conversation with all the history.

So after this situation, she said I lied to her, talked to my ex, saw her, it is almost like cheating. It was a very very hard day but she finally forgave me. I felt really guilty at that time.

**Large quarrel #2.** We were discussing how she can move to me to B. Because of the lockdown, it was harder and she couldn’t get a touristic visa. The options I found were language school, marriage, studying, working.  She is still studying and doesn’t know the language so finding a good bachelor program here seems to be impossible. The same goes for the job. Then she asked what I think about the rest two. I said that I don't know, but I don’t really want to marry just to get a document about that. I want it to be a very happy thing in my life but I am not ready now. She shouted that I don’t love her and if I did it would be easy for me to do that. Then she slapped me for the first time. She said that I’m like all the other men, the same motherfucker, can’t do anything important. Reminded me about that guy who asked her to marry, said she didn’t love him but he at least could do that to her and she loves me but I can’t.

**Small quarrels.** One day we were discussing previous relationships and she is very jealous of my one. I still don’t know how many she had, only know there were much more than 150. I said one time it hurts me and she said we either break up or I accept her. The problem is I accept her now and accepted before but it still hurts, I think about that way too often and can’t even discuss with anyone.

She also said I have too many girls-friends. I really have some. I have a lot of male friends but they never write to me without a solid reason. Girls can do that. I have 2-3 friends-girls, one is married. But I stopped talking to all of them, created a new account in messengers to talk only to girlfriend. Still using it but she said a few times I’m trying to hide something from her and checked my previous account. There was nothing special obviously so we were fine.

**Vacation.** I asked my employer to work from A for a month. After a month I had to go back.  Wanted to spend a bit more time with her, so take a 1.5-week vacation and we went to C with my girlfriend. It was a very lovely stay. We lived near the sea, it was great weather and a great place. I was happy to be with her, I guess it was the happiest days of my life.

On one of the last days there, she asked what we will do if she can’t get a visa. I said I will regularly fly to visit her. She asked there are other ways, I can marry her for example. She asked if I will do that and I didn’t know what to do and was thinking, she was angry and sad I didn’t answer and left. Then she returned, we were discussing it, she said that everything will be the same, why can’t I do that. I thought “ok, fine, I love her” and asked her to be my wife. She was waiting, went to the kitchen, then returned and start asking if I really need, if I am sure if I really want it. And I answered I am not really sure, it is scary but I love her.

She cried a lot, shouted at me that I ruined everything and we are breaking up. That first I didn’t answer her, then asked to marry her and then said I am not sure about that. I was very guilty about that, asked to sorry me. She slapped me. I begged her to stay there a few more days because I already bought a back ticket for her. I can even leave myself if she wants. She said I should, thrown the neckless — my first gift. Then I asked her to marry again, said I am sure.

On the last day we were in C she asked me to buy her a ring. I said ok and while we were walking before the flight we checked the jewelry store she liked, it was closed. So the whole day I was looking for something but not telling her, didn’t find anything good. At the end of the day, she shouted at me again, said I can do all the small things for her but can’t do the ones that are really important and she always has to ask. She selected a nice place to say that because there was a jewelry store near us,  I asked her to go together and choose the ring that fits good.  She said I can’t do even anything myself. I went there, there were not very many of the rings, I didn’t like most of them: large stones, weird structure, materials she doesn’t like. I found one I like with many small stones with a nice shape. Bought it, gave it to her, but it was too large and from her face, it looked she didn’t like it. She said thanks, it is good and so on. Later she said sorry, that she won’t ask me about such things because it looks easy for her but she forgets that some people just can’t make a good choice. I felt really sad at this moment. 

Then I escorted her to the airport, we said goodbye to each other, cried, said we will miss each other, and promised to meet soon. I spent 4 hours to get to my airport and just before the flight she came to A and sent a photo of the new ring she bought instead of my one, she said it’s nice and she loves it.

**Now.** And now she talks so much about the wedding. She's planning thee dates, the rings, etc. And she's sometimes sad or angry that she feels she makes me do it and I don't support her enough.

**Conclusion**

Sorry for writing mostly the sad parts of our relationships. There are so many good things, I love her very much, I appreciate all the time I spent with her, she means so much to me and I am scared to lose her. I feel bad living alone now. She is planning the marriage and how she will come to me. And I can’t understand what I want. I still afraid of the marriage, I want just to live with my girlfriend because I didn’t have such experience and she has a lot of that. I see two options only: to lose the person I love so much and to marry being unsure about that. I wish you my friends can suggest something to me. Feeling very anxious and can't sleep or eat because of this."
Anxiety,Self isolating!,So I’m having to self isolate for 14 days due to being exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID 19. I’ve been doing well with my anxiety recently but this sort of situation has the potential to put me in a really bad place. I usually find exercise and being outdoors keeps me in a good place. Anyone got any good ideas to keep me going through the next two weeks.
Anxiety,Anyone else feel completely fearless after a panic attack?,"Luckily I get full-on panic attacks very rarely, but when they're finally over I feel amazing. I'm so exhausted that I don't give a shit about anything anymore and it feels strangely freeing. Unfortunately that feeling only lasts for a few hours though."
Anxiety,Fuck flying,Only done it once when I was a kid. I know if I flew again I'd be like the guy from the twilight zone.
Anxiety,I have been producing more Saliva then usual... Is it because of anxiety?,"Well, about three or whatever months ago i was just recently having these anxiety and panic attacks... A lot of things have been happening in my body like dizziness, light head, or like you feel like you lose Consciousness i have also been getting a heavy feeling on my chest or i feel like something is pulling my chest down... Or like there is something in my throat preventing myself from breathing is this all of because of anxiety?"
Anxiety,Booked my first therapy appointment!!!,"Title says it all honestly, but I wanted to add than I’m so proud of myself for finally taking action. 

I really hope it helps. Right after ending the call my anxiety was quite high because speaking on the phone always has this effect on me but still I did it!"
Anxiety,oh well. just got prescribed sertaline/zoloft.,anyone else who remember what it was like to start with it? im supposed to start with 25mg a day.
Anxiety,"Anyone else suffer from public speaking anxiety, where you would rather quit your job than have to present something in front of your peers or leadership?",What did you do? Did you end up quitting or powering through the anxiety?
Anxiety,I hate random Anxiety.,"So, it is very easy for me to snap myself out of an episode if I can justify why I'm anxious like I am expecting something or over-excited about something and start stressing over that.   


What I really struggle with is random anxiety. I am sure you all know what I mean. Your sitting on the couch, enjoying a nice evening and then BAM you have that pit in your stomach and feel like everything is wrong and million little things that wouldn't phase a ""normal"" person pick away at you. I hate this so much and it always seems to get me and I end up being in that state until I am able to distract myself or go to sleep. It sucks, it really sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to vent as I hope it will help me or maybe some of you will relate and not feel alone."

Anxiety,How to deal with anxiety around getting to places on time? It wastes my whole day.,"If I have a meeting at 3pm, i start worrying about it at like, 12pm.  I, general, I work my way backwards and talk myself into worrying about it way too early.

My thought proccess goes like this :

**""So, i need to be there at 2.30""** (self imposed early arrival to ensure that when I arrive, I can navigate any fiddly details around where exactly to go)

**""So, that means I need to leave at 2.00""** (even if it takes 10 minutes to get there, ill allow half an hour)

**""So, that means i need to start winding up at 1:30..""** (even if im already dressed and ready, i still feel it takes me half an hour to leave..and it sometimes does due to me double checking everything...)

..and like..at 12, ill start to get anxious that this 1.30 time is coming up..Ill be distracted and look at the clock every few minutes (Even though I have an alarm). 

The more important the meeting is, the more of my thought process goes into it.   
The more uncertainty around the route, the more buffer time goes into each step..

An important meeting at 6pm will basicly ruin my whole day."
Anxiety,how do you deal with the anxiety that everyone hates you for some reason?,"i can’t help but feel as if everyone hates me or thinks i’m stupid. i really want to stop caring, but i honestly can’t. and it gets so bad that it affects everything else — i can’t study or sleep because my thoughts about being hated are distracting me. pls send help :("
Anxiety,I hate this,"I’m a uni student and ever so often we’d be placed into small groups to discuss a case with our lecturer. In year one I was always so shy and I never really felt confident in answering or contributing to the discussion. This year I’m literally forcing myself to change that. 

Yesterday we had another discussion and I may have interrupted my lecturer to contribute. When it happened I got so shy and awkward and it completely slipped my mind to apologize because she stopped to listen to me. 

Anyway, my brain has been torturing me about it since and random thoughts about past situations are popping up. 

I feel so bad. My brain is literally just trying to pin me as a horrible person and it sucks because throughout my life I felt like I needed to prove to myself and others that I am a good person sigh"
Anxiety,A kind of jerk or jolt while trying to sleep,"Is it just me or you guys also sometimes experience a kind of a jerk when trying to sleep at night?It happens to me when I eat heavy or spicy dinner ora meat like a goat meat (but not a chicken meat). And also i get startled several times a day...I have done ECG,Echo, Thyroid and everything are normal."

Anxiety,Waking up early in the morning,"I have no trouble falling asleep but I always wake up at 5am-6am. sometimes I wake even earlier, in the middle of the night around 2am. And spend the night in between sleep and awakeness. 

I hate it"
Anxiety,It’s been a terrible day for me and anxiety,"I have been thinking a lot today. Every day, I surround myself with pessimists. It’s affecting my physical and mental health. I feel like I’m losing my sanity. I feel alone, scared and consumed by darkness. I don’t have anyone who understand and can talk to me. It’s breaking my heart. I don’t know how much I can take anymore. Doom and Gloom comments and news make me much worse. I don’t understand how one article is enough to throw off. I’m not refering to a specific article. In general, All It takes is one article or comments from internet to ruin my day. I can’t explain why I act this way."
Anxiety,"I always get started when I try to sleep in the afternoon, literally even if someone peaks in the room","I am M(20), I get tired after the hours long lectures and try to nap in the afternoon,but somehow always I wake up with a shock.

Anyone relates to this? Can someone help?"
Anxiety,It's been such a horrible week...,"My anxiety has been up all week,I started getting chest pains. And I find, it's starting to trigger these weird suicidal thoughts. Like...I just want to not deal with anxiety anymore...or for anyone else to have to deal with it"
Anxiety,Hypochondriac nerves,"I suddenly got very anxious. This is my first shift at 911. I will be staying the night here because we have a hurricane coming.

I am  hypochondriac so now im wondering if ill be ok here. Will I pass out from dehydration or low blood sugar? Will I get dizzy from the two? I don't have any health problems besides anxiety but just right now I have all this going through head. 

Plus im very VERY tired right now. I need a cup of coffee."
Anxiety,My doctor finally listened to me!!!,"After changing doctors several times, I finally found a doctor I was comfortable around. And when I decided to open up about my anxiety she actually listened to me and didn't make me feel like I was imagining things.. It's really nice to finally have a doctor that takes you seriously and I hope this is a step in the right direction for me"
Anxiety,My anxiety has never been this bad.,"I think my anxiety is triggered by feeling not in control. The fear that I have no real control over my life. And the fear of conflict. Those 2 are pretty big for me. 

Lately I’ve been waking up with severe anxiety. I feel sick to my stomach with anxiety. I just want this to end."
Anxiety,"What do you do when you ""hear"" yourself overexplaing something you already complained about a million times?","In my case it's more about health issues. I try not to feel pity about what I'm feeling and I am aware that overthinking about it makes the actual physical pain worse. So what I try to do is take it easy but sometimes I am ill for so long that I get bored about it and I hate when I have to tell someone about it. Because they're normal reaction it's just ""Ohhh, but you're not that bad"" (even doctors). 

So what can I do to not feel self-cringed about what I say and also to not take health as if I were to die any second?"
Anxiety,Differentiating between anxiety and social anxiety,How do I know if I have anxiety or social anxiety?
Anxiety,Guidance Please?," Hi everyone,

So, I've been freaking out a little bit over the last couple of weeks. I'm 25, my BMI is exactly where it should be, but I lived a very sedentary lifestyle (no exercise really) between the ages of 17 - 23. For the last two years or so, I haven't been on any form of steroid inhaler, and only used my reliever before exercise. Over the last couple of months since Coronavirus started (I did also have a bronchitis type infection in February, could have been Corona, who knows.), I have found myself feeling 'breathless'. I went to the doctor, I've had bloods done (they were fine), and I've been put on 1 puff of Clenil Modulite morning and evening. I do also suffer from anxiety and have done for many years, but I am not medicated.

Now, I'm not entirely sure if I am breathless, or if its all in my head. I'm very 'conscious' of my breath, and I can focus on it quite a lot sometimes. These are my symptoms:

1. I 'feel' out of breath when getting of the sofa. I'm not sure if this is breathlessness, or I notice an increase in my respiration rate because I've gone from sitting to standing.
2. I have a VERY minor audible wheeze when I open my mouth wide and exhale gently... I don't THINK it comes from the lungs, but it does disappear when I take a bronchodilator, which does concern me.
3. I live in an apartment building, and my flat is on the second floor. It's 60 stairs to reach my floor. If I run/walk up the stairs to my apartment, I can be left out of breath for a couple of minutes. Is this normal?
4. One further example: yesterday I walked up a hill which is 1.1 miles in total. The whole way is a hill and it's relatively steep. At the top of the hill I was quite out of breath and felt pretty weak, I waited 11 minutes to see if my breath would come back, and it got a bit better but I didn't seem to recover super well. I took 1 puff of my blue inhaler and I seemed to recover quite quickly. Firstly, it concerns me that I need to take a puff just from walking up a long hill, and it bothers me that I need to take it before exercise otherwise I feel pooped.

I'm really freaking out that I have COPD or some other horrible disease which is causing me to not breath as well... I would really appreciate some guidance/opinions."
Anxiety,Anyone else get the anxiety shits?,"Throwaway account because...not sure if I’d like this tainting my public acc....

Am I the only one who gets the shits when I get anxiety?!? Along with the typical stomach feeling, restlessness, etc......it’s so annoying. ESPECIALLY if it’s anxiety when you need to go somewhere - come on body, I don’t have time for this!!!!! So annoying."
Anxiety,Stiff joints on Lexapro? 😐,"Anyone else experience this? I only get it on my right side. Fingers, hip, arms, legs, neck. Thanks!"
Anxiety,Help pls,So I’m 16 male healthy extreme health anxiety so my new doctor told me that my anxiety meds alorazolam where bad for me considering they can become addicting it’s a high dose it was a 1 mg so he percribed me something else it’s in the same category as Zoloft etc so since really yesterday Since I stopped taking i feel so weird like I feel like imma pass out drop dead my body feels like it’s burning I feel lightheaded and so weird idk why It’s almost like maybe I’ve become addicted I feel like I need it the alprazolam idk if it’s the withdrawals symptoms or maybe something is wrong with me and my health and maybe I should go to hospital idk why I feel like this help pls is this normal?.
Anxiety,My anxiety of losing control is getting too intense for me.,"For context, if needed, 16M with GAD. 
So recently I've started taking Seroquel 25mg for my anxiety, and while it did help partially I've noticed it made my anxiety of losing control more and more intense. In my past I've lost a lot of good friends and even best friends because I let out a saying that caught me off guard when I wasn't that aware of my actions, because I was tired or on medications or any other thing that made me not fully aware of myself. I do have a tendency for making tactless remarks and sayings when I'm not in control of myself, and the anxiety that I might lose another good friend because I'm not in control and I insult them or hurt them got so much stronger and it frightens me. I've come to the point where I isolate myself from everyone when I'm tired or even when I have coffee or energy drinks or just simple meds because I don't feel like I'm in control of myself. How can I tame my anxiety and feel half comfortable talking to people when I feel that I lost control of myself? Sorry for my English, I'm not a native."
Anxiety,How to get over old friends?,"So recently I cut off 95% of my online friends. For almost over a year and a half my only source of interaction was through Discord, where I made my best friends through a community. I ended up in a very unhealthy position where I would rely on this group of 15+ people for everything; help, comfort, socializing, etc. Took me a while to realize they weren't actually very good people and treated me pretty poorly, and after months of denial I finally left and forced myself to go out and fix my shit. Since then I've made a somewhat strong friend group in real life which I'm proud of and leaving that server seems to have fixed so many of my problems. But, now I cannot seem to get it out of my mind. It feels like every day I regret leaving despite knowing it was for the better and I can't stop thinking about them and how much time I spent doing stuff with them. Almost everything I do reminds me of them. I really just want to move on but it sticks. We used to talk about how we would all meet once we graduated, how we'd be best friends and stick together forever,,,, and I know all the nice things they said about me weren't genuine because of later events but it feels like I dedicated so much time to them and I've lost so much by leaving. I still see their feeds on social media and I don't want to outright block all of them but I also don't want to think about them. The only person I still talk to from that group was someone I met just before I left through a mutual. She lives a state away and agrees with the reasons I left and we still talk regularly which makes me glad, but then that kinda makes me feel like I'm not really doing what I intended by leaving to better myself. I'm kind of at a loss and I'm not sure what to do, it feels like every thought contradicts each other. I'd really appreciate any advice, thank you &lt;3"
Anxiety,Stop! Please read my story. This can help you ( possibly),"This was my personal experience.

I too had problems like overthinking, sleep problems at night, and many others..

Some of my earlier habits, which was responsible for my anxiety-
1) waking up late
2) eating no raw fruits and vegetables
3) no exercises
4) overthinking
5) no time management
6) no daily plan
7) used to listen lots and lots of songs
8) not socialising much
9) no meditation.


I wanted to change. I started taking baby steps and it took me 2 year to transform 180°. Yes I am totally a new person now.

So how I started- { took baby steps)
1) Firstly I changed my diet. Slowly. I started eating fruits daily. Avoided pizza &amp; cigarette. Earlier I used to smoke daily. Slowly once in week then month's.  What we eat, is what we become. I turned vegan. It was damn hard, damn hard. Can't express in words. The hardest part was to quit smoking. Anyway, after my vegan diets for around 2 months .now My mind was calm as compared to before. 


2) Then, I started a very simple yoga practice. Called TRATAKA ( this yoga involves starring at a black point In a white background. I used to do trataka for about 10 minutes every day. This improved my concentration exponentially. But it took around a month's of daily practice of about 10 minutes.

3) I started to write about my awareness of breath. Everyday, I wrote, for how many hours I was conscious of my breath out in 24 hours. For the first week, I noticed I was only aware about only 30 minutes in 24 hours.  I worked on it. And I reached 5 hours. I was aware 5 hours out of 24 hours of my breathing. Inhale and exhale. This changed my life.

4) started loving nature. I would simply see rising sun, Stare at flowers for long. And others

5) started doing simple yoga.

And many others.


Result-

For the first month, the results were low. 
From the second month, I was noticing tangible results.

Now, my mind was calm. Now I responded, rather than reacting. Also, my overthinking is gone now. 

My suggestion-
Start small. Take baby steps for your improvement."
Anxiety,Propranolol!! Advice!!,"After talking with my dr again, I told her I didn’t like the odds of Wellbutrin either helping or hurting me 50/50. 

So! I mentioned Propranolol to her and she said it will likely be the best one!! 

Any advice on it? She told me I can have A DRINK in the evening, but honestly doesn’t advise it at all. I can take it as needed and if I don’t like it I can quit!! No side effects! 
She’s also getting me the lowest dosage possible!!"

Anxiety,"Constant waking up angry and sad crying from nightmares, shaking my limbs in bed","Yesterday I've worked 12h on my second shift as a manager and I'm feeling exhausted.

For the numerous time today I woke up crying and tossing in bed, being unable to feel anything else than some pressing sensation in my chest and total emptiness. Literally just violently shaking off my limbs as if to get something off me. Every morning. Like I hate when by waking up I'm realising I'm in my own skin.

As I wake up, I want to cry even more. I don't even know why. My brain is still unconscious. I just feel the need to do it and can't stop.

My dreams have transformed into full blown night terrors which do not wake me up at night but I suffer in the morning as I gradually wake up from them. Maybe because I smoke before bed to calm me down these nasty fuckers appear at morning. (My sleeping pattern might be damaged)

They started about a year ago and if before they were somewhat randomised, including happy dreams here and there, now it's the same thing again and again. It's always just me travelling through stations in the UK (where I moved about 4 years ago) and being unable to get anywhere and not catching any transport. And I'm always late for work in my dream. People are usually hurting me. I'm always anxious and travelling.

I know this is related to my anxiety about the future and having to start a completely new path. It's a path of transformation hence dream symbolism travelling = changing. 

I was woken up to my boyfriend having sent me a picture of roses in a fleshlight jokingly saying he found the perfect place for his roses. We recently went through a very rough patch and got back together. I texted him this morning I was feeling a bit hurt by this and he just unsent it and asked me why.

I know it's small things but I haven't mustered up the strength to reply to him. I feel on edge all the time.

Does anybody know what can help me because I'm feeling totally clueless at this point ... I can't even rest properly. If I take a nap during the day same dreams reappear again! 

I'm taking citalopram 10mg. I had a phone appointment with a doc to try and up the dose but I totally forgot about it when he called me at work. I quickly apologised and asked to move it to another date. I feel so worthless. I'm just wasting people's time."

Anxiety,Always feeling bored and restless.,I can't start or complete a task. I have a lot things to do(college work) but I can't do anything. I want to pursue a hobby but I can't. I feel like I want to do something but can't. I want to get rid of this. Need some help.
Anxiety,Crumbling,"""Things do get better, trust me I've been there"" - ADTR

Hearing that lyric made me realize that for me, things don't get better. I've said it before and I still say it. The sadness and hopeless feeling just shifts around... I don't really 'get better' 

The past two years I have worked very hard to learn new ways to exist, to recover from an eating disorder, to work on my self-transition (transgender person here), and to cease my self-harming habits and learn to love myself and find the things about myself that I like, even if not everything. 

What I have learned is that although I used to believe something was deeply wrong with me, there is not. And one might think that revelation is helpful, freeing, but it isn't. It just makes me feel like a prisoner even more. There's nothing I can do to 'fix' me, because that isn't something that needs to happen and can't really happen. This is me. This is who I am. And that isn't liberating. That is hopelessness inducing. I hate the way that I am. I hate who I am. I hate myself. 

The past two years I have been through the highest high I've ever had, and the lowest lows I have ever had. The high didn't last long. The lows last too long and continue to this day. It doesn't go back up. All the walls to the castle I was building for myself have come crashing down. The innerworkings and foundation for my castle have caved in. I feel like I've come nowhere. I have rehabilitated my body and am no longer a slave (physically) to my eating disorder. Mentally I am still just as plagued as ever. I tried to transition medically and start coming out to people, and that came to a dead end halt as my anxiety took over. My therapy is going nowhere and we circle around the same things most of the time. Recently I did have that revelation of nothing is deeply wrong with me. 

Yet...this just leaves me with the utter most hopeless feeling I've ever had. 

I'm young, in my 20's, I work in an office job, a cubicle, doing meaningless work and trying to falsely convince myself that it means something, that I am valuable for what I do. It isn't so. My job could vanish in a day and life would go on. My company would go on just fine without me. My work is worthless as is myself. I am owed nothing, I contribute very little, and I am supposed to be a leader of a small team, but I am not fit for this position with the way I am. I can hold myself together perfectly at work. I can feign the leadership mentality, but I'm not actually skilled in it. I've no experience and although I'm gaining it, I don't think I deserve it. I shouldn't be in charge of people. 

No one here knows about the fact that I force vomit or hurt myself or even hate myself. No one knows how I wish I would die in a car wreck on the way home and to work. No one knows the nights I go home and cry or drink and how often I have considered sneaking a bottle with me to my job. It would be so easy. The only thing about the alcohol is that it mixes badly with my medication. 

I want to quit my medications. One of them provides seizure risk, and even though the other is an anti-convulsant, I don't think it will counteract the fact that I may have a seizure some day with the amount of purging I have been doing. I want to quit them so I can purge more and not worry about a fucking seizure. 

My life is a waste and I am a waste. I just hope that my being here provides a stepping stone for others to reach higher places and better places. Otherwise, what use am I to the universe? I don't contribute much. 

I'm a very fearful person, but I hope someday I will have the courage to remove myself from this picture. All the walls of my hardwork have come crashing down with me under it and unable to get out. The walls of the castle I was building for myself are wrecked. Nothing gets better. It only shifts from one thing to another. Nothing gets better."
Anxiety,Can't sleep.. at all.,"I stopped taking my meds for anxiety and depression a few weeks back and I've had some on off days, some days I've felt sorta okay and other days I've felt awful with anxiety. My sleeping pattern is completely flipped, I woke up at 5pm in the afternoon yesterday and still haven't slept so nice then.. I lay for hours and can't sleep at all, I've tried background noise, I've tried quiet, but my heart is racing and as soon as my mind goes anywhere but panic and anxiety, my brain just brings it back.. times like this I wish I had my depression at its max, when I don't wanna be alive, my anxiety is a lot better, I don't care about the consequences of anything.. but right now I'm tired, my anxiety is permanent, I feel sick and soon will just wanna die"
Anxiety,Anybody else experience on and off head pressure and ear pressure that is pretty painful?,For the past two weeks or so I’ve been getting on and off pressure in the front of my head. (Temples and forehead area) it’s not super painful but it’s very uncomfortable. I also have been getting random bouts of pressure in my ears that is pretty painful but it also comes and goes. Has anyone else experienced this and Could this all be caused by anxiety?

Anxiety,Anxiety about spending money prevents me from getting treatment,"I thought at first I needed to ask for advice, but maybe I just need to rant.

When I'm having a good day, sometimes I feel emotionally ready to begin seeking treatment. Based on mild benefit from past treatment, I probably would benefit greatly from the right daily medication.

The problem is that my deepest anxieties are about spending money.

When I sought treatment a decade ago, things were on a good track, but I had to go see a doctor every couple weeks so they could basically say ""do you want to self-harm? No? Ok, we will up your dose by 0.5%, make an appointment on the way out."" Each of those visits was anxiety-inducing for normal medical visit and time-off-work reasons, but also because they cost me $150 ish for a less than 5 minute conversation. I was mildly improved by the medication but probably needed to try a different one, and the idea of the cost of ramping up a different medication via pricy micro-visits was not something I could handle. I basically just cold turkey quit by telling myself I was cured, because of the cost.

I want to try again to get on a supporting medication, and thought there might be opportunity to get prescribed at lower cost via phone or online call...but when I started investigating, it seems like the main ""teledoc"" services universally cost $230 for a psychiatrist visit! That's about 4x the cost of their normal calls for normal situations! And because of my frugality-anxiety, my insurance is a ultra high deductible plan that won't cover anything at all until I pay something like $7000 in a plan year.

It's a vicious cycle for me. I'm irrationally anxious about spending money, so I can't pay for treatment for my irrational anxiety."
Anxiety,Sometimes I feel disgusted at myself for sharing too much,"Sometimes I feel disgusted at myself for sharing too much, I feel like an attention-seeker that wants others to constantly know what's happening in my life or needs to give me advice even though I've just met them. 

It's embarrassing, it's stressful because my main objective was to share a little bit to get them to open up to me, so I can get them comfortable enough with me. But whenever the conversation ends, I feel like I'm driving too much of it, and that I intentionally steer the convo to be about me and not the person who I want to get to know and understand. This is embarrassing, I hate this, I hate that I do this. I know why I do it, to feel secure. 

But I hate that when I panic or get too comfortable, I keep treating living human beings as ""people"" in my head that I just use and dump my thoughts on.  they are people, not thought-dumps. they probably find me annoying

I used to keep myself isolated and ban myself from speaking to others whenever I cross this rule for myself-till I learn to get better. But I know that's not gonna help. I know somehow that being frustrated with myself is not the way to go, but if I keep doing the same mistake over and over again, what else am I but a simple pain? Why can't I just get over it, and be my ideal self?  I hate this. I hate that the best advice out there is to forgive myself because it's hard. because sometimes I feel like I don't deserve it."

Anxiety,Wrote a little something: ✨ On being unafraid of uncertainity and learning to accept myself.✨,"I've always been the perfect planner. The one who'd always have it all 'figured out'. The one who knew exactly what she wanted out of life and where she wanted to be. I couldn't imagine not knowing 'what next'. 

But little did I know, all the beautiful things I liked to achieve, were infact drawn from a place of negativity. A place I wouldn't wish for anyone. Perfectionism at its best. 

Being a perfect person wasn't easy. Let me tell you. 
It was hard keeping up with a facade. Smiling in the face of adversity even when it killed me inside. Taking on hardships one after another, pretending I was doing just 'fine'.  Keeping up with all the unrealistic expectations of myself. But infact, I was not. 

Giving up control has to be one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. It's a perfectionist's nightmare. But it taught me to be free and to value myself more. 

And to take life with a pinch of salt.

Life's supposed to beautiful isn't it?
And not a gnarly mess.

Anxiety,Super anxious when I just wake up?,"I have an appointment with a cardiologist soon and they asked for me to take a reading of my blood pressure and heart rate as soon as I wake up. For some reason, though, i just freak out about it and that makes my reading super high, like VERY high. 

Does anyone else experience morning anxiety and have any suggestions as to how I can relax? My anxiety usually calms down a little a few hours after I wake up. I sleep enough for my age and I don’t drink coffee or smoke. I just wake up and suddenly my brain is in full “we’re in danger” mode"

Anxiety,"I’m so mad, depressed, irritated, and anxious about myself.","I’m 37. I’ve been working as an equipment repair technician for the past 10years. Started in the medical industry and I just moved to manufacturing. I’ve worked my ass off for the past 10years..... moved jobs a couple times because of pay and opportunity. Now that I’m in manufacturing I don’t have much knowledge of the equipment (the company knew that because of my resume). But I’m being treated like a disappointment because I’m not able to fix problems right away. Everything I do just seems to annoy my boss. My boss is 27. I’ve got this kid treating me as a kid. Just today he asked me if I’ve ever worked in a place with regular preventative maintenance. I was so offended... that is what I’ve been doing for my whole career and we’ve spoken about it many times.  I’m trying to not let this hamper me. I’m working my hardest and trying to learn as much as possible. Been coming in at 3 and 4 in the morning, showing up before my boss and always leaving after him. Half my life is gone and I haven’t amounted to anything professionally. Everything I’ve worked so hard for doesn’t mean dick. I’ve seen my friends and family all build their carriers and move forward. But I’ve just been moving backwards. I’m not a shitty worker... I care about my work and what I do a lot. But I just can’t stop tripping over my own foot. I’ve come to the realization and I’m just not that kinda person that is successful or respected. Right now I really don’t feel that I will ever amount to anything. I’m always just going to struggle. I’m so scared that I’m going to end up homeless or a burden on my family. I’m already a huge burden to myself. Should I just keep jumping from company to company...I’ve also been think a lot about starting my own company. Not to be rich or anything, just so I can support myself. But I don’t know what to do.... what do I sell!?!? I just want to crawl in a hole and sleep. I’m so tired and exhausted in myself.

Anxiety,"From someone with GAD, Severe OCD and Anxiety (Triggering)","Hello there, i m only 21, but was self aware of my anxiety pretty early, i had a lot of fears, i was obsessed with death, had low self-steem, had Homosexual OCD, Harm OCD, most of the time i was stressed and i reached a point to where even thinking made my head hurt, after this point nothing seem to matter, and i started to using something called mindfullness. 

Here it goes - Accept those thoughts, accept everything and the reactions that are happening don't overthink, you are not your thoughts, you have your own personality. 

  
Don't seek for reassurence, it will make anxiety worse,  for those that can't sleep at night, let the thoughts come and they will float away.

While doing mindfulness start to do exercise, look for hobbies, even play games ahah. You will get better i know it :)"
Anxiety,Cont. palpitations days after panic attack? //Trigger Warning,"Hi everybody, new to this sub and am wondering if anyone can offer advice... *not looking to be medically diagnosed, trying to get a dr appt ASAP but easier said than done.*

A bit of info: I’m a 26yr old female and in good health (just not mentally!!) I’ve struggled with severe anxiety since childhood but began having panic attacks when a repressed memory surfaced in April. I had the second during a very negative conversation with an ex in June. Both of these were sudden but I was under great duress and felt “normal” the next day. 

The third took place earlier this week and was by far the most physically taxing and happened *very* suddenly without any warning. 

I was laying in bed falling asleep when suddenly my heartbeat was in my ears. I started to breathe deeply, vaguely recognizing the feeling from past times. I tried to calm myself by sitting up, but my arms and legs began shaking so violently that I was unable to control myself. I was also on the phone when it happened and when asked if I was okay, I physically couldn’t respond—my teeth were chattering so hard that I choked and couldn’t form words. 

My heart rate has fluctuated during the past few days, resting at a normal/slightly high rate but rises quickly at very small things and I have increased anxiety about another attack happening. Luckily I have people to talk to that care and help me calm down when needed, but I still have a lingering tightness in my chest which I’m guessing is from the unexpected stress on my heart (and in general.) It feels like my ribcage is hollow but I can feel my heart thumping away. 
~~~
My question is if anyone has experienced something similar i.e. heart palpitations continuing after said event? as well as nausea and feeling super flighty. Am I just putting more stress on myself by worrying about it, any way to lessen this?? What a rabbit hole. I know very little about panic attacks themselves so this may be common but it’s not for me! 

Thank you so much for anyone that takes the time to read this, let alone respond, and I hope you all are doing well.

TLDR; had a serious panic attack and now am dealing with increased heart rate at the drop of a hat and an ache in my sternum. Would love some advice!! :)"

Anxiety,How do you get diagnosed with a mental illness?,"I’m not 100% sure however I think I may be bipolar and have anxiety, I’m not too sure about bipolar cause I only suffer some of the symptoms and they only occur occasionally but I suffer the symptoms of anxiety all the time and it runs on my mothers side of the family. 

I was just wondering how can I get a diagnosis as to whether I have these mental illnesses or not, mostly focusing on what is actually done to see if you suffer from these mental illnesses."
Anxiety,Can’t get rid of the feeling of needing to take a deep breath,"A few days ago, I realized I’d been to the doctor a few times recently and also eaten with my hands immediately after going to the grocery store (without washing them), and started worrying that I might’ve contracted COVID. As a result of that, I’ve found myself relatively frequently feeling the need to take a “full” deep breath, somehow to maybe prove to myself that my lungs still work and I don’t have COVID.

I’ve experienced this feeling a few other times over the last few years. Usually, I’ll find myself thinking about something stressful and won’t be breathing properly, and will feel the same urge to take that “full” breath. This occurs whenever I think about whatever issue is bothering me, and usually goes away after a few days if I get distracted and/or move on.

Anyone else ever deal with this? Any suggestions on how to make it go away?"

I couldn't be any clearer when people ask me how I'm doing but anything I say that relates to myself not doing well gets completely ignored in any conversation.  It's to the point where I'm having trouble getting out of bed and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I need some sort of relief.  What do you do when you feel like the people closest to you don't care or can't be trusted? The people around me can't see anxiety for the monster is truly is and I'm getting too tired to try and help them understand. For the past 5 years I've worked on using conscious language and I've been proactive in finding ways to fight my anxiety and gain control over it by arming myself with the right tools and using logic to combat my irrational thoughts, but my partner who had helped me so much has recently started to use my anxiety against me and I just can't anymore. I trusted this person and let them in and to have them do a 180 like that, I feel like I don't truly know anyone anymore. I feel completely alone."
Anxiety,Moving:/,"Hi! I'm moving out of state next week and I'm feeling excited, but very anxious. I've never lived this far away from family and been on my own in this way before.

Anxiety,I don’t know what to do,"I’ve never posted about my anxiety because I’m embarrassed to tell people how bad it is and whenever I tell most people, they just tell me I need to get over it or work through it...Because, YEP, it’s that easy apparently! But, I’ve hit a pretty bad rut this week and I think I just need to know I’m not alone in this...

My anxiety has always been horrible ever since I was about 8 years old after some traumatic life experiences. Now, at 22, my anxiety is just as bad, if not worse. Like, it’s so bad that I cannot run errands alone without having anxiety attacks just driving to where I’m going, being at that place, and then again driving home. The only way I can actually feel even a little normal is if I have my SO as a crutch alongside me when we’re out and about. And that makes me feel so weak and broken that I can’t just do basic shit without needing someone to keep me stable/normal. 

The reason this has been bothering me more than usual this week is because I’ve recently started thinking about the possibility of needing a new job where I’m not working exclusively from home... Now I’ve worked outside of my home before but whenever I have it’s been complete hell on my psyche and one of the most uncomfortable experiences having to interact with So Many people. It’s insane because I know how to talk and communicate with people when I have a familiar crutch or I’m just around people I know but if they’re unfamiliar people, it’s like I forget how to and look and feel like such a weirdo. Did I mention my anxiety attacks also bring about the most intense sweating you’ve ever seen on a non-active human?? I just don’t know what to do or what type of job I’d even be able to handle...I also have a dog that I’d absolutely hate leaving home alone all day after being used to me being here all the time and having his own bad separation anxiety issues...I know that’s a dumb excuse but I know he gets freaked out as bad as me whenever we leave him alone(I must have rubbed off on him)...

I have also taken anxiety meds before but the only thing that has ever worked has always made me feel like a zombie and incapable of normal human interaction just as much as the anxiety. There just doesn’t seem to be any real solution and I can’t help but feel like a failure in life."
Anxiety,im falling back,"\*tw/ mention of self harm\*

i was doing really good. 

11 days ago i was on the edge, and i realized that i didn't want to die or hurt anymore. i quit hurting myself, and i was doing really good.

and then i realized that when i stopped hurting myself, i stopped eating.

i was doing so well. i almost didn't realize. i would eat a good, healthy amount every day, decent homemade food, vegetables, the whole deal. 

yesterday i freaked out. i'm considering joining the volleyball team at my new school. so i decided i should you know, get in shape and stuff. i went to the park and started working on my form. i'm going again today. when i got back i knew i was hungry but i couldn't eat. i didn't want to. i went to have dinner with a close friend. i barely ate. she made dessert, i left before i ate any. i almost skipped breakfast. i could only stomach a quarter of what i normally eat. 

i just, can't.

i know it's not healthy, but i can't do anything about it. i just, can't eat.

it's hurting myself, but in a different way. and this one isn't voluntary.

i don't know what to do."

Anxiety,I had a panic attack during my Grandma’s funeral service,"Yesterday morning I had to wake up early for my grandmas funeral service and I’m on antibiotics currently and they make me quite nauseous if I don’t keep a full stomach especially, and I didn’t have time to eat beforehand. So I was standing in the sun trying not to vomit while the service was going on, and this led to me panicking about what would happen if I threw up, or passed out during the service, and then I started panicking more and feeling like I was about to die in front of random relatives I’ve barely seen before, and knowing that I couldn’t go to the car to calm down until the service was over made me freak out even more. The service was no more than half an hour long but I hate the fact that I can’t even maintain my composure for that small period of time and I couldn’t even focus on what the person doing the service was saying. It’s like my brain knows what the worst times for me to panic would be, and of course I always panic during those times. I just wanted to rant about this I know I need to see a therapist maybe I finally will make the first step for that now"
Anxiety,Ativan?,"So I'm young and healthy and have been taking Ativan just 0.5mg on and off for like 2-3 years. Yes there's been months of T breaks where I don't need it / stop taking it. Never had withdrawals. I have PTSD, INDOMNIA, ANXIETY &amp; PANIC ATTACKS
 I even tried to unsuccessfully potentiate my ativan the other day with no luck. I don't abuse, I just have s long journey with most psych meds not working, giving me bad side effects and / or making me worse. No more SSRIS OR ANTIPSYCHOTICS for me. Even beta blockers make me sick....I haven't had the best luck with Klonopin, it gave me an amnesiac mania attack I got hyper then lost my memory....Xanax gave me rebound anxiety. I'm afraid of losing my Ativan script because it works but only sometimes and I don't have many side effects from it. What should I ask my nurse practitioner? What other benzos are out there? I'm not trying to get high I am strughling with irritability, social anxiety and picking my skin from anxiety. What to do? 😞😞 I don't know how to bring this up. I don't want my Nurse Practitioner to give up on me. It's been a long hard road with meds and trying to find ones that work. I'm too sensitive to most other meds. I have a theory that generic benzos can be wonky...especially brand-to-brand...they are all different. 😞 the closest thing that helps has been Gabapentin but it takes 4 hours to kick in, gives me GI issues and I build too much tolerance after one dose, so it's not practical.

I mean everything is fine. I decided to take some time off of jobs searching /trying to find what I want to do (I'm still lost on that) the past two weeks, and decided to play games just to steam off and have some fun.

I used to draw, and I keep taking on music on and off, I liked cooking for a while but then I dropped it since it was too demanding

But like, despite all that, and all my efforts to do something and feel better. I still end up having this gut-wrenching feeling in my chest and stomach.
I doubt everything, I barely have any friends, I lack trust in everyone. My head just doesn't stop getting worried and building up fights in my brain, and scenarios of bad things.

I'm always tired, lacking energy, frustrated, and angry. Even though I'm not an angry person. I used to be really calm and nicer than this. I just don't know what else to do.

I tried therapy once, but it sucked because I felt like the dr was just blaming me, which made me feel worse so I didn't go again.

How do I get over this? How do I feel better when nothing seems to work?"
Anxiety,"Serious anxiety with public speaking and alcohol problem. Need to vent (warning, this is long)","I just want to thank and appreciate in advance anyone who takes the time to read this. Like really just being heard will probably make me feel better. The title explains the purpose of this post and sorry but this will be long. 

I want to preface why i think I am the way I am, first and foremost. Ever since I was a teenager and started experimenting with drugs and alcohol (pot nicotine and booze) i have developed an anxiety disorder that is getting worse. I am 26 now and it has progressively gotten worse since about 15/16. All three substances have contributed in different ways. Pot has made me more aware of my shortcomings and surfaced a lot of internal issues I have. Nicotine and alcohol have contributed as coping mechanisms. I started using all 3 substances at around the age of 15. I was badly addicted to nicotine (dip and vapes) but have recently quit and have been sober from that for about 1 year. I have pretty much stopped with pot as it just surfaces way too much negative emotions and thoughts, which is just way too difficult for me to handle it atm. Booze is my biggest issue and I will expand on that later.  Just to preface, I think all of these substances have contributed to my anxiety disorder.

I know I need to deal with this professionally but there are many things getting in the way. For one, I do not have time or money for therapy at the moment. I am currently in a doctorate program and about to graduate in less than a year as a doctor. As you can imagine the stress from this program is really tearing me apart and takes up a LOT of my time. Like I barely have time for anything else besides school. 

I have always been the perfectionist type and take things very personally. I try so hard to not let my ego get in the way but it’s really hard not to. My ego is basically what gets me through the day. 

The biggest an really only issue I have with this program is the plethora of public speaking I have to do. I fucking HATE presenting. It is traumatizing for me and no I’m not being dramatic. My heart pounds even thinking about doing it when in the comfort of my home weeks to months in advance. Thinking about doing it even now as I type this is making my hands very cold and clamy and my heart is pounding. My stomach gets nauseous, I lose my appetite days to weeks before the presentation, and I have difficulty sleeping nights before. I lose weight during the semester because of all of the stress and lose of appetite. Knowing that I have to do a presentation at the end of a semester is literally enough to make me depressed the ENTIRE SEMESTER until I’m done with the presentations. No joke.... Legit feelings of despair and agony from one presentation.... it’s pathetic, I know. Most kids only get nervous during or right before. Not me. I get nervous MONTHS in advance to the extent that it manifests itself physically. I try so so so hard to not let this effect me and the fact that it does this much makes me feel even worse about myself. Like why tf am I like this?? Why can’t I control this anxiety like others? I legit see classmates laughing and having fun during and right before they present but then there’s me in straight fight or flight mode MONTHS before I present intermittently.  

The funny thing is I’m fine in the clinic when one on one with a patient during my clinicals. It’s only when speaking to big groups of people where my anxiety gets really bad. My clinical instructors even made notes about how confident I appear with patients and my last clinical my CI told me I am “much better than the average student”. It’s just the damn public speaking to groups of people that fucks me up. Its so bad I have to drink alcohol before every presentation or else I will basically have a panic attack. In my mind there is no other option as it’s the only thing that is affective. I need to perform or else I don’t graduate and look like an incompetent fool and embarrass myself which lowers my reputation. I’m at the point in my schooling where I need to set a good reputation for myself to move forward successfully. All this is just so embarrassing.

In fact that is the worst thing, the embarrassment. After every presentation I do my classmates make fun of me saying how nervous I looked and how fast I talked. It’s clearly obvious and I have the reputation now of being the nervous kid in the class. This is just reinforcing all my issue and making everything worse. “Just don’t care what people think bro”. Yeah that’s just not realistic. Anyone who says they don’t care what people think are fucking lying. I’m convinced of that. 

So this is why drinking has become an issue for me. It’s basically the only thing that can give me relief from my stress of public speaking. My confidence is really low right now and I’m about to graduate. I just hate feeling inferior. Everyone else in my class just appears so calm and collected when they present. I know deep down they are nervous but at least they can hide it. I can’t even hide it WITH alcohol. And I’m talking 3-4 shots back to back right before every presentation. Presenting without it is basically not an option as I will have a panic attack and not pass the course for failing the presentation. Talking to a professor is not an option either as they will tell me to grow up and deal with it like everyone else. Talking to friends and family is not an option because as a man I am expected to uphold a certain level of strength and composure and will be ridiculed and ostracized if not. And yes this has happened to me in the past. My dad has literally told me “only pussys get nervous” and I can tell my friends have lost respect for me for opening up about this. 

It just sucks because I am such a smart and otherwise competent man but when it comes to public speaking I crumble. Usually the advice I get is, “just do more of it bro you’ll get better” and that just has simply not been the case. The more I present the WORSE I feel because I know I basically made a fool of myself each time.  Now when I present I feel like the class is just waiting to see how nervous I get and it doesn’t help that people ALWAYS point it out after every presentation.  I feel so damn pathetic about this. I have 3 presentations left before I graduate and plan to drink before each of them just to get it over with. I know I will be fine once I graduate. 

Can anyone relate to this at all? Any tips? 

Thanks"
Anxiety,Cannot sleep or function alone in the house,"Hi! I understand going to a therapist is a better option but I somehow hope this sub will be helpful. I, an adult person cannot be alone in my house. 4 days of the week that I have to spend the night alone I experience all kinds of pain mostly chest pain and occasionally arms or feet. While I know it is related to my anxiety, the constant thought of me having a heart attack or having covid or thoughts of me dying in my sleep do not let me sleep or just relax when im alone. i cannot be productive and usually just sit there panicking and crying because I know that nobody will help me if something happens. How do you guys cope with this?"
Anxiety,Always feeling like I’m doing something wrong,"Hello, recently I’ve been struggling with self esteem, and my anxiety has been amplifying it, I just feel like I’m always going to mess things up or do something wrong.
Example: I’m starting a new job, and I’ve been waiting on the phone call for a start date for half a week now, and today my husband needed my car to go to his job, and of course that’s when my new job calls me asking if I can come in today, knowing that my husband needs the car I ask if they could start me early next week so my husband could make his job and I could have a little extra money to make the 45 minute drive to my job.
They were very kind and understanding and fit me in next week no problem, but my husband, not yelling but kind of frustrated told me that I should’ve gone and he doesn’t want anything to go wrong at this new job, so for like the past two hours I’ve been having panic about how I’ve messed everything up and how I always do the wrong thing, my husband seeing how distressed I am tried to assure me that it will be okay, but it’s to late I’m already in full panic, and afraid my new job will have negative opinions of me or that they will be mad at me.
What do you do when you always feel like you do the wrong thing, and you feel like people will always dislike you for it."

Anxiety,Teenage Anxiety,"All right Reddit, I need advice. I myself suffer from depression and it's managed, but anxiety runs in our family too, and it hit my 17yo son like a brick today. He is self aware to having social anxiety for a few years, but it's been manageable so far. 

Today, he had issues with his zoom class and he totally shut down and was crying, fidgeting, teeth chattering. He left his computer and tried to find other things to do. This is a first for him and he's a great student. He got through it and was able to talk with his teacher, but was still very upset when I got home 45 minutes later. His teacher was very kind.

We'll obviously be looking into medications if it continues or worsens, but I'd love some ideas for what he can do in the moment. I'll get him some sensory strips, and give him the list of things to see, feel, smell, etc. But that's where my knowledge stops. I prefer crowd surfing than researching (although I will research too). I just like the idea of networking with some tried and true methods from folks who truly experience anxiety. 

Thank you in advance for any tips y'all can give. Redditers are a great resource and support system when it comes to these things. You guys are great encouragers!"
Anxiety,"Anyone else feel like their anxieties are too big for this world, that no one will understand?","I have a history of dissociating, where my mind is off worrying about some unanswerable existential terror instead of focusing on the present and any actual issues I have.

No one would understand.

I check my friends if theyre meeting together to fulfill my fomo. I hope that they would ask if we want to hang out together again because last time it was me who suggested it and i dont want to be the always asking guy. It doesnt help that im at the end of my college and most things i did before like theatre, student council, sports or other things are either delayed or canceled. 
It took me a lot to find people i like and now im scared to lose them while we got the pandemic. Earlier this year i had a panic attack which didnt help at all because i couldnt see or do anything in weeks. I didnt had any work or any tasks to do. I felt like shit and the only thing thats helping me right now are the tasks i have to do."

Anxiety,Has anyone considered Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Treatment Resistant Depression,"I'm considering this for multiple reasons, my main problem being anxiety/insomnia. It is supposed to help control parasympathetic nervous system and in turn leave you feeling more calm and relaxed. The nerve also connects to multiple organs in the body, including organs in the digestive system that can react to stress. The only problem is that although it is approved for treatment resistant depression, I cannot find any doctors around my area who list depression in their categories for consideration. It is mainly used for epilepsy to control seizures and that is the only people I can find. Has anyone tried this or know of anyone who has? I am very interested and have been suffering for quite a while and at this point, want to try something different. I already went down the natural route, the prescription route, and the exercise, meditate, eat better, etc etc route. So i'm not looking for suggestions of what you could try but more specifically if this is something you know is available in your area."

Anxiety,How can I help my boyfriend with his anxiety?,"
*Throwaway account because bf uses reddit* 
My boyfriend(19,m) and I(19,f) have been together for just over a year, recently his anxiety has started to get worse. When he gets really anxious he gets really quiet and fidgety and he starts to overthink, sometimes this can last 10 minutes or a couple of days. I really want to  help support him through these times but I don’t want to do the wrong thing or do/say anything that might make him feel worse. 

I’ve already asked him how I can help but he’s not great about talking about his feelings or needs and his anxious spells are quite new to him so he told me he wasn’t sure. I’ve already got him a wee fidget cube that he quite likes but what else can I do/ say? Any advice would be very appreciated :)

Anxiety,Developed Panic Attacks and Physical Anxiety after edible,"Developed panic attacks and physical anxiety after a strong edible

Hi everyone, almost 6 weeks ago I had a massive panic attack on an edible. It wasn’t my first time getting panic with weed but I haven’t been the same since. My heart races all day, I have chest pain and I have very bad insomnia. My head feels like it’s floating sometimes and I couldn’t leave the house without getting dizzy. I have panic attacks at least once a day and feel adrenaline shooting through my body often. Yesterday I felt adrenaline all 24 hours in my legs. I started taking an anti-depressant (for anxiety), sleeping pill and have Ativan. I also started seeing a therapist who says my mental anxiety is now manifesting itself differently. It’s been almost 6 weeks of feeling this way and these are the worst times of my life. I was super healthy before this aside from mental anxiety. It’s extremely hard to function daily with only like 2 hours of sleep each night. I’m hoping the anti-depressant will help more once it kicks in, I’ve only been on it for 5 days and it has helped a lot with getting rid of the dizziness. Has anyone else gone through this? What else can I do to help myself, this is the hardest point in my life thus far. I doubt this permanent but I’m so scared this is going to be my life now for months/years and that I’ll end up in the hospital again due to insomnia ( I already went once where they gave me the Ativan). I’m the past 4 days I’ve only slept 7 hours and I’m scared I’m going to end up in the psychiatric institution."
Anxiety,Wanting to feel ok again,"Lately my anxiety goes up and down. It's like I'll wake up and feel peaceful but then it kicks in and I feel like something will go wrong.

In university and have deadlines, midterms, finals so that's stressful. My mom telling me to get my masters so more pressure there. I just want to work and make some money already. How to deal with the pressure I don't know. Getting away from weird toxic roommates soon so that's good."

Anxiety,"Anxiety about mental health, need advice from people who have recovered, possible triggers!","Hey reddit,  


I'm using a throwaway because I deleted my old account, thinking browsing these subs was no good for my long term mental health as I am prone to hyperfocusing on stuff.  


I am looking for advice on how to deal with the constant fear of ""losing my mind again"".  


Backstory, (skip this paragraph if you're prone to triggers!)   
&gt;!I'm almost 30, male. A bit more than a year ago, after being a casual marijuana smoker since my teenage years, at a festival I got high on laced weed and started experiencing severe panic attacks. This led me to believe my friends were working for the police and wanted to arrest all my DJ friends and the whole festival was a sting. I further tried dismantling our hotel room mirror, thinking there was a hidden camera behind it and everything was being taped to be used as evidence. My other friend thought everyone was plotting to kill him for 2 days straight from the same weed. I had experienced debilitating paranoia before, especially on edibles, but usually it was gone by the next day. This time it was very different, as if the paranoia broke through the border of my inner rationale and fused with my personality. The next several months were hell, I experienced severe periods of depersonalization and derealization. I could not have any fun, drink, or smoke. I stopped seeing almost all my friends and stayed at home almost all the time due to how I felt. Basically for the first time ever my inner strength was shattered completely, I went through deep existential crisis and I haven't really felt fully like ""myself"" since then. On a positive note, I have not had a DPDR episode for months, I sleep and eat well, I have restored some of my previous relationships and started a new job at which I'm doing very well. !&lt;  


Ever since last year I did not know what anxiety was. I had experienced it before without lasting consequence until one day some panic attacks completely broke me and traumatized my inner self through DPDR for months. Since then I have regained my sanity but I still feel like a child which is terrified of going near the stove because its only memory is of that time it got burnt when it touched it. I often remind myself subconsciously that the fear of ""losing it"" is very real as it has already happened once. How do you deal with that fear that you might get stuck in that vicious DPDR cycle?  
I know people are supposed to ""face their fears"" but with DPDR and anxiety it is the last thing you want to be exposed to more. I want to be able to enjoy and live life again without the fear I might lose my mind if I get drunk once or smoke some weed.  I know I have to let go of some degree of control over myself but I am terrified I will lose control completely and permanently and become a crazy person.

Psychiatric medication is certainly something I will never take as my psyche requires therapeutic and spiritual healing and not physical. Unfortunately therapy is not an option where I live due to drug-related stigma and prejudice and I have not met any open-minded therapists. I mostly rely on self-help, my few close friends and the internet.  


I would love to hear some success stories or personal advice from people who have dealt with a similar fear and how you built inner resilience. Thank you all in advance."
Anxiety,After having my anxiety under control for almost 13 years I'm now struggling and don't know what to do,"I was medicated for my anxiety as a child (10-12) it was really bad then, but after hearing my mom trash talk the medication I stopped taking it. 

I learned healthy ways to cope and eventually my anxiety mellowed out. It was still there, but so small it became a part of my daily life. 

These last couple months it's hit me really hard. It keeps rising and there's this constant pressure of worry and illogical situations pushing down on me. I've had two panic attacks after never having them before in my life. I thought I was having a heart attack yesterday. 

I feel so upset I can't eat, and when I do I feel sick. My body's shaking uncontrollably. I can't sleep after never having had an issue with that in my life. I can't focus on the things that normally keep me calm. 

I'm so tired."
Anxiety,Do I Have Anxiety?,"For some background, I’m 14 years old in 9th grade. I would say I’ve always had anxiety throughout my whole life. I started having panic attacks really young, and my family would even joke with me that I need Xanax, but it was honestly true. My anxiety is now to a point where I cannot even go hang out with my friends without my entire brain almost shutting down, and I can’t even have fun because I don’t feel comfortable, or chill enough to even live in the moment. It’s an indescribable feeling. It’s like the feeling you get in your feet when you’re looking over a SUPER high railing, but it’s all throughout my body. I’ve literally cut contact with all of my friends because I can’t relax and stop having 5 million intrusive thoughts run through my brain with any of them, and even myself. I don’t even know if this is a thing, but I categorize my anxiety as existential because I have an existential crisis all the time. it’s not depression, but it makes it really hard to be able to have fun when there’s 1 million thoughts running through your head telling you that nothing matters but at the same time you’re anxious about not living your life to the fullest and dying having regrets. I also have no clue who I am, or who I was, or who I want to be, and it makes me crazy. It feels like I’m losing myself but then again, have I ever been found? Losing yourself is the worst feeling because you’re the only one who can find the old you, but you don’t even know who you’ve become or who you’re looking for. I’ve always felt this way and the thought never leaves my brain. Again, I feel like I’ll be able to understand it better when I’m a little bit older but I can’t keep living this way. I literally can not even sit by myself in my room without my brain telling me a million things I’m doing wrong. The intrusive thoughts never go away. That’s why I can never relax, whether I’m alone or with friends. I’ve distanced myself from everyone I love because of this. I want to be a teenager and have fun but I can’t. I butchered this explanation but please let me know your thoughts. I’m really scared to talk to anybody."
Anxiety,My state of mind not stable now,Help! All kinds of emotions trying to burst out of me! I want to cry! I want to be crazy! I want to die!!
Anxiety,Just wish I had someone to comfort me,I really have had alot of bad things happen to me lately actually my hell has been a reality and by that I mean my worst fear could be coming tru that is losing the love of my life i just want to make friends with some good hearted people message me :) u will be very appreciated
Anxiety,Random anxiety? is it normal?,"Last night  I pulled an all nighter completing homework for my class in the morning. After class I decided to go to sleep, but I started having what I think was anxiety for no reason at all, I mean I wasn't even thinking of anything, I just wanted to sleep. I was laying down then I got the feeling of pins &amp; needles in my arms, then I  started to feel short of breath so I opened my eyes and everything was blurry &amp; spinning, I was fighting to keep my eyes open. 

I finally sat up and called my mom to talk to me, because I started to believe I couldn't breathe and I was having a stroke or something. I know the bulk of the anxiety came after the  random shortness of breath &amp; p&amp;n but why did it even start in the first place?

I've had a few panic attacks before, and actually went to the ER for one before but they've all been because of things, stress, fear etc.

 i've never felt anything like this before... It was very odd. Is this a common thing among people with anxiety?"
Anxiety,How can I stop feeling guilty and pathetic for having anxiety?,"I feel like a fucking baby constantly. Guilty. That I'm just making excuses constantly. 

I went to school on Monday and Tuesday, but I couldn't even muster the smallest bit of courage or  try to push myself to go to school today, instead I just started crying and my Mum gave up and just let me have today off. 

She makes me feel bad for it because she tells me that she's also anxious and has to lose work and customers because she has to drive me to school and pick me up early because I'm too pathetic to even deal with school for 2 hours.

 I feel horrible and weak and like a stupid baby because of it and that I'm just making things worse for myself. I have almost no support and I just want to give up.

I feel horrible. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I'm back to square one."

Anxiety,Feeling stressed when there is any change and worried about parents finances !,"Hey guys so I’m 21 and my parents  are buying a new home. And yes I still live with them as I’m from an Indian background so it’s common for us until probably till I’m married or when I finish my studies (which I’m gonna finish at 4 years as I’m probably gonna do masters) also I’m in a relationship but I don’t have any hurry to be married lol probs till 30 cause I’m still immature for that mind set so is my guy lol. 

Anyways reason we are moving is because we live in an apartment which is not a bad size for 3 people but I guess it only has 1 bathroom plus the rooms are kinda attached in a way (hard to explain) and I guess we all always wanted to a independent house. We actually have been interested since I was 18/19 but it took a while for my mum to actually show interest in moving. Anyways we finally paid a deposit today (not confirmed but it’s like a holding one) however Idk why I feel kinda sad all of sudden since we live in such a convenient area (trains, food and local shops) 
The new area is very beautiful, I guess more posh looking  and will also have these amenities in a year (it’s still a bit new but already almost developed). I just wish we chose a house earlier aha cause now I’m just so used to our apartment!! Lowkey I feel like my parents are too since we were all kinda quiet in the car after giving the deposit lol. 


Also we actually had the budget for 725k but have gone with a 745k (double story, 4 beds, 300 ms2 , new area ) which is kinda cheap for what you would get in Australia for new areas  (Sydney)

isn’t an issue but I guess it just means my dad and mum would have to pay off the house longer.
The thing is I wanna help but they won’t let me pay rent. I think I’m more stressed out than they area. Although we only paid a holding deposit (which means we still can look at more options) the $1000 isn’t refundable. However my dad said if during the cooling off period we find something cheaper he wouldn’t mind.
Idk why I’m getting so stressed and I’m not even apart of this lol. I also feel a bit sad cause I’ll miss the area. My parents also wanna give me the bigger room but I honestly don’t want it 😭
I just wish I could help out. I mean maybe if the house isn’t confined we could just save money and renovate the apartment a little I guess but idk.
Idk what I’m trying to get off here other than I’m feeling anxiety"
Anxiety,"Aware of heart beat, cant sleep","Hi all,

These past few months I have been increasingly aware of my heart beat. I do have anxiety in regards to my health, amongst other things. I have gone to the doctor numerous times the past 2 months and they tell me nothing is wrong. 

In addition, I was in the hospital for a non related issue and was examined by cardiologists and wore a heart monitor for a week and both the cardiologist and the nurse said I was fine. I can’t help but worry and doubt them when I feel my heart beat. I always become aware of it when I lay down to go to bed. Does this happen to any of you? Any tips?"
Anxiety,Feeling constantly drained,"I feel like this is a good place to post this because I struggle with anxiety and hopefully others have experienced similar problems? 

Anyway I’ve noticed that on days when I’m out of the house more or going to school or hanging out around people I feel constantly tired. Regardless of how long I slept the night before or if I take B12 vitamins or drink caffeine or whatever that morning. I’m only 17 but I feel like an old grandpa on days that are impossible for me without a 1+ hour nap. I sorta think I look (or sound) like a zombie — being tired and having a monotone voice — and it hurts my self image I guess. Plus I feel like I’m wasting my life when all I seem to do is work or sleep.

Has anyone else experienced similar stuff? Do you have any advice? I’ve talked to a doctor in the past and have had my blood drawn but didn’t really get any solid guidance. Thanks in advance :-)"
Anxiety,"I’m worried that I’m a bad person, like I’m those nasty online gamers on the internet who are mean to everyone after playing Online for a bit.","I don’t know if this is going to work, I assume people are just going to tell me to “grow up” or just heartlessly not give a **** and just be apathetic about it. 
I’ll try though, I would appreciate the help.

I’ll try to keep it short. I guess to start, I’ll begin by saying this; I was just on my Switch playing Smash Ultimate online because I enjoy it. My recent opponents make me feel not good things. I mean, they’re REALLY good, having a high rating online which is to be expected, but such players make me feel uncomfortable. I feel like they are trying super hard to play or win, like they don’t care about having fun and only want to win at all costs. I usually call these types of people “try hards”, but I ask myself is that even true? I decided to look up what a “tryhard” is on. On Reddit, I found lots of different opinions on this word, the one response that upsets me the most is that try hard “is what people with an unhealthy emotional relationship to gaming call people they lose too in order to protect their ego”. I also heard someone say  “Try hard” was a word people used against players they’ve lost to because they don’t like losing and try to come up with an excuse why they lost (basically calling someone a tryhard as an excuse of why they lost). I thought tryhards were just players who took the game too seriously to the point where they forget to have fun. After reading others’ opinions on what “tryhard” means, I’m very nervous now. 
I’m really starting to wonder if I am like those nasty people online, the ones who can’t accept losing and make excuses for everytime they lose, the overly egotistical and rude people. I know sometimes I can be egotistical and even arrogant sometimes, I am not perfect. I prefer to not be that way because it’s wrong. It’s not helpful. Losing upsets me too sometimes, but I always try to remember to have fun. Why play a game if you’re not going to have fun, am I right?I’m just really worried that I may be someone who just calls really good people a “tryhard” because I don’t like losing and I’m an egotistical jerk. I’m worried I’m a bad person.

I’d like to think I’m not a bad person, but some help wouldn’t hurt. If you do reply, I BEG you watch what you type, I am too emotional to deal with nonchalant, apathetic, cold hearted, unkind, people online. :("
Anxiety,Why therapy isn’t helping ?,Hi everyone! I need your experience... I suffer from anxiety since childhood but lately it’s getting worse.

I know my thinking isn’t rational but does anyone else’s anxiety spike when they think about their online presence and how un-private it is or like freak out a little at any random add on IG, snap etc. like how do you have my username lol"
Anxiety,I just moved to dorms and I'm scared of cooking in the shared kitchen :(,"I'd add the flair ""advice needed"" too if I could. I just started living alone, and I get very anxious in social situations, yesterday I was too anxious to go to kung fu class (but I managed to go to a restaurant afterwards! Which I'm proud of!) the whole prospect of going into the kitchen with people in there and making food, or the possibility of people going in there while I'm making food, is scary! But it's also necessary for me to get more information about trash, etc, and I want friends, but I'm too scared! It feels like nobody wants me here, even though I only moved in yesterday! And eventually I have to help clean the halls etc, and I just... Don't know how to deal with this. This was a mistake, I should've chosen the dorms in my home town where we had private kitchens, this is too nerve wrecking for me! But it's also too late to go back, I lived in a foster home and it was time for me to move. I just need support :("
Anxiety,Anxious of something that didn't happen,"So for the last two months I've been studying to tests in uni and still am, and for the first month I've been totally focused although very anxious about both the tests and what's going on in the world

Adding to that, a week ago my mother has been concerned that my relationship with my girlfriend are making me not feel as well because I've been quiet and closed up

Some backstory: I'm a girl 23yo and my gf is 25yo, I am the youngest child and also this is my first relationship, I have supportive parents and they know I am anxious and can get really down at times, and in general since the pandemic started I've been really down, barely eating and unable to be as social as I used to be even when my friends ask to meet up (not saying depressive because I'm not diagnosed)

My mom thinks I'm down because of my girlfriend, and I kind of understand because when she comes over I don't talk as much with my family and focus more on her, but that's because she's very anxious herself around new people and even when they try to start a conversation she can't really engage and get stressed, but she can't help that, she's like that with everyone and even more my parents

I don't want her to feel alone as I talk with everyone and not focus on her but it's really hard trying to get her to engage more in conversation

She knows how my parents feel and is bothered by it, but after having several conversations with my mother I decided to talk to her again only after my tests are over so I won't lose focus

Now, I'm usually the kind of person who when in a bad place I try to find other things to feel bad/stress about (I am going to psychologist) and now that this matter is kind of ""solved"" for the time being (as in I am willing to really put it aside for now) I have another thing that bothers me

My brother and his fiancee want to plan a wedding, it's a problem right now because of the pandemic so everything is postponed, they don't have a date or a place or anything and I do think it's a good thing because now nothing is certain

My gf always talk about us going to the wedding and slow dancing and stuff but I'm really stressed because my bigger family (most of them) don't know about us and some of them are religious

For my oldest sister wedding I invited my friends and we had a lot of fun and because they knew each other they were okay not being with me while I was with family and stuff like that

It won't be like this with my gf, I only have one friend in mind I can invite who will be with her while I'm not around and that's considering she'll even be able to come to the wedding, and I can't be with her (my gf) all the time because I'll have to be with family, greeting and talking and just generally be there for my brother in sister in law to be

The thing with my mother stresses me even more out now regarding this whole thing, I really don't want to be stressed about this event because I'm really excited for them and I love them and I don't want to add pressure to the whole thing not to them or my mother

The thing is, and the reason why I didn't put this on relationship advice, is that this whole thing didn't happen yet so I have nothing to stress about, they don't even have a date yet

I'm sure that when the time comes I'll be able to handle it

But I think that if I didn't have the tests right now that I need to be focused on I wouldn't be anxious as I am right now, but I am finding myself crying about this thing that didn't happen yet instead of focusing on studying! I kind of feel ashamed of talking about this with someone because I feel so stupid

I don't want to talk to my gf about it because I don't want to hurt her feelings and bring up the whole ""I'm scared about my family knowing"" thing and also ""my mother isn't sure about you"" thing (she knows already), and also it might end up being a small wedding with family only so I won't be able to invite her anyway

If there's a need I'll post it in relationship advice but I felt like it belonged here because of dealing more with anxiety

Thank you for reading!"
Anxiety,Went to Florida a few months ago for my sister's birthday and to see my new niece for the first time. It was horrible,"I have pretty bad social anxiety and absolutely hate being around other people especially strangers and in groups of 3 or more. My sister told me it was gonna be around 7 people. Me, my mom, her boyfriend, my brother and his girlfriend and his newborn girl and maybe one of my aunts that I haven't seen since I was a kid. It ended up being around 30 people, I only knew the 6 mentioned above. I hate being around my mom because she makes a big deal about literally everything so imagine me already panicking and wanting to leave nearly as soon as I show up after an 8 hours drive.

I made a conscious effort to try to be sociable but I couldn't. Everyone kept asking me to get in the pool and why I wasn't going in the pool like every 5 minutes. I found a couch and took a nap for a couple hours. Every time I wanted to hold my baby niece my mom had to keep making such a huge deal about it and wouldn't stop taking pictures even though I kept asking her to stop. My family knows I'm struggling with money and barely could afford the gas to get to Florida and they made me feel like shit because they said they would cover me for the restaurants we went to. One was nearly $40 a plate and the other was $30 or so and they complained about me being pricey.

It was great seeing my aunt though because we talked about a lot of family history that I didn't know and learned a lot about my roots from Italy."
Anxiety,Anyone who’s taken or has been on buspirone can you experience side effects even after the first dose?,"I took my first 5mg last night around 10pm and I woke up 4 hours later with tremors, feeling over heated but not sweaty and slightly nauseous. Could this be side effects already from the medication?

I get tremors when I wake up already regardless of the medication but I woke up like two hours earlier than I usually do. So it’s making me wonder if it’s the medication maybe?"
Anxiety,My anxiety attacks used to be so bad I would sleep in the car at hospitals.,
Anxiety,Still not stable to get a job yet it’s been 6 months,It’s hard when your anxiety is still very intense to the point where you’re even afraid to go outside some days I’m still working on medications I don’t really know which ones will help the only ones that help with the side effects are drowsiness and sleepiness but I have ADHD and low blood pressure where I get tired very easily and I can barely walk and feel energized I have all these other health issues that I can’t have caffeine or energy drinks so there’s nothing I can do to make my body energized to get where I’m wanting or needing to go but I push myself every single day but the point is I’m still trying to figure out medication and I guess I’m just venting right now but I just hope I’m not alone with the things I Eddie the fact that they can take over your life and it’s just a matter of time that you have to keep pushing yourself to get through it and I just wanna feel like I’m not alone
Anxiety,Is it okay to take a break,I'm on medication and it's been two days since I'm on a plan. Somehow I got another attack despite being on the meds idk what was the trigger. When do I need to get up from my ass and actually do something again?
Anxiety,It does get better,"Hi everyone!
I just wanted to put it out there for all high schoolers and university kids. It truly does get better after. I started my first job as a graduate for a company and while my anxiety was really terrible the first few months I really started to come into my own here. 
Everyone stopped being scary proper adults who I couldn't even look at to being comfortable enough to make a lame joke with.
I was even able to make a demo video presenting a functionality for our client services colleagues and while yes it was recorded so that made it easier, I still didn't die recording and editing it! It's live and I'm so proud I was able to do this! 
Here's to continuing to use our techniques so we can life our best life and not let our anxiety stop us from being us!"
Anxiety,Anxiety Recovery &amp; Intrusive Thoughts,"Hi all! I’m in anxiety recovery after a really bad 7 months and feel like I’m in a really good place when it comes to the physical symptoms and panic.

I think with the volume turned down on physical, I’m noticing more intrusive thoughts. They range from “you won’t be able to handle parenting in this pandemic” to random flashes about my teeth getting broken (they were knocked out in a field hockey game many years ago). I have always had these (like most people do, and never gave them much attention) but now I feel like I’m fueling them by responding to them with worry and they’re coming up more and more. 

I don’t feel like it has gotten to the point of OCD but I got into an incredible anxiety looking up the OCD Pure-O types and feel like I’m now generating imagery and thoughts from just looking those up— which I never had before! THEN I get sucked down the wormhole of OCD medication and what potential side effects id have, could I get pregnant again etc. 

Did anyone else experience these thoughts on the path to recovery? I’m hoping to get back to where I was before this anxiety “episode” started where I could let the weird thoughts float in and out without fueling them. I just feel so “suggestible” that anything I read I take on."
Anxiety,motivate me,Fear of failing class and never making my dreams come true. Comment motivations please and how to study harder!
Anxiety,Does anyone else get health related anxiety? I feel like I'm going mad.,"On March 2nd my grandfather (paternal) died of colon cancer. On March 11th my great grandmother (maternal) died of complications of pneumonia. 3 days later, March 14th I was rushed to the hospital because I couldn't breath. I had pneumonia. Less than a week later, the first big reports about Covid started. 

I have been a wreck since. I have panic attacks almost daily. I've been to the hospital at least 7 times, 4 of which were related to my panic attacks. I can't sleep, I hardly eat. I feel like I have COVID even though I know I don't.  I've been tested 3 times, all negative. I feel like I can't breath, ever. All I think about is my breathing, all the time. My heart rate swings out of control, I feel like I'm going mad.

I've been recovering from the pneumonia since then, along with a myriad of other health issues. I feel like I've barley been out of bed in months. I've had anxiety my whole life but never this bad, never this often. I'm on edge all the time. Loud noises make me jumpy, seeing something out of the corner of my eye makes my heart jump. 

I feel like I'm dying. At least once a week I have a panic attack so bad I'm afraid i might just stop breathing all together.

I really just dont know what to do anymore."
Anxiety,Desperate for options,[removed]
Anxiety,Adapting to change and new people,"This is my first reddit post, so if i should know anything about whatever, please let me know. 

Two months ago i changed my job. I absolutely loved my last job, but it was too far from home and the pay wasn't that good, so i got an opportunity in my home town. This new job si totally different from what i'm used to, the dinamic here is just crazy (people yelling, slamming doors etc). Thing is...i need time, a long time, getting used to new places and new people. Here i am seen as a really shy and reserved girl and i can see that they pity me and try to get me ""out of my comfort zone"", but this only makes me feel worse. I tried to tell some of my coworkers i need time, but they seem to brush it off. I am a little bit socially awkward at first, i can't easily just talk to someone random, but if i am asked something or i have things to say about a topic, i talk. I am very talkative with people i feel comfortable around. 

I am overthinking this a lot, but i can't help it. There is a lot of pressure on my shoulders too, the CEO expects his employees to be perfect, and me being a new one, i don't want to fuck anything up. A couple of days ago, the coworker i share an office with and i were suddenly announced that we have to move and our direct superior is going to be someone else. I felt pure panic and my mind went into overdrive. The work in itself didn't change, but here i am in a new office, with more people coming in and out, overwhelmed and scared shitless of making any mistakes. Oh, and in october i am starting my first year of college (i'm 20 yo, dropped out of college 2 months in, 2 years ago), so i'm even more worried.

I think i should note that i've been dealing with depression and anxiety for some good years, now on medication (lexapro) and seeing a psychiatrist regularly. I am really sensitive, but now i think i manage it fine. 

The thought that i can go back to my old job it's the only one that comforts me a little bit, but it's not enough cuz i keep thinking that, if i go back, i will struggle again with money. 

How could i approach this? How can i get used to new people and new environments without mentally exhausting myself?

tl;dr Got new job, can't get used to the place and new people. What do i do?"
Anxiety,I basically never go to school and feel so pathetic cause I just feel like I can't go,So basically I just get up and do all the normal stuff I'm ready to go to school then I just don't go and I stay in my house sometimes I'm confident enough to go out but most of the time I get there then just walk home but rarely I'll get confident then I'll go for a day or two but then I'll just not go for the rest of the week and my stuff gets taken off of me today my stuff's gonna be taken again and I don't know if I should just ask my parents about like if i have stuff wrong with me like obviously I do but I mean idk what exactly it is and I feel so stupid and pathetic and I can't really speak and i have like 2 friends and everyone in school doesn't like me I don't even look bad and im not that stupid I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm kind of rambling anyway if anyone can help it would be very nice I'm 15 and a boy just to let you know if that's important idek 😔
Anxiety,Depression/anxiety,"I’ve never been to a doctor and I don’t feel the way that social media or other forms of media make this feel. But I have no motivation to do anything, I know that I’m ruining my life but no matter what I do I can’t make myself get up and fix it. My parents dismiss what I think/feel and give me the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” speech but no matter what I do I can’t make myself change. I’m not opposed to therapy or anything like that but I feel like I’m alone with this. Any advice?"
Anxiety,Anyone else after a bad night of no sleep anxiety when they finally get out of bed they feel “daised” or just not feeling normal sort of distanced from everyone??????,HELPP!!!
Anxiety,Fluoxetine and sleeping problems,"Hi, sorry if this has been talked about before but I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on switching medication.

I was prescribed Fluoxetine to deal with obsessive rumination and it has basically cured it. However, after 7 weeks of being on it, I'm still struggling with one of the side effects.

It's had a big impact on my sleep. Not the time I go to sleep, which has remained the same, but I drift in and out of sleep through the night. When I finally wake in the morning at the usual time, I feel very tired. So I sleep for a few hours more, meaning that I am bed for far too long!

I am due a review meeting with my doctor soon and she will ask me if I want to move to another medication. The options she gave me at the start were Fluoxetine, Sertraline or Citalopram.

Which one should I request, or do they all mess up sleep? Thank you."
Anxiety,STI anxiety making it impossible to function and sleep,"25F here. I honestly don't know what advice I expect from this, I just wanted to vent. 

I've had some itchiness and irritation in my private area for a few months now. I'm in a long-term relationship and I checked in with my boyfriend immediately, he has no symptoms or complaints. My anxiety has been torturing me, telling me it's an STI and he secretly cheated on me. I even talked to him about it, he told me there is no way and told me to go to the doctor. I keep obsessing over the revelation I'll make and the thought of having to break up with him torments me.Because of my anxiety, I was postponing going to the gynecologist for weeks and the irritation persisted, not worse or better, just the same. 

Today I finally went to the gynecologist and she confirmed I was experiencing a mild skin irritation, which could be a result of contact dermatitis, a yeast infection or an STI. Hence, she gave me some anti-fungal meds and ran bacteria and STI tests, the results of which will come out on Saturday.

Problem is, I can't function or sleep, constantly fearing the results and what may follow."
Anxiety,How to be calm during driving lessons,"Today I drove for the first time and while driving was ""ok"" I was nervous and sometimes did stupid things. Te instructor told me many times to relax and drive more smoothly but I couldn't do it. I don't know what to do, I'm not really scared of driving but in manual you have to be careful while shifting gears, clutch centrol..."
Anxiety,Anxiety attack during a game of sport... i think?,"Does anyone know what happened to me?
I felt nervous on the way to the game so did some deep breaths on the way in the car &amp; shrugged it off.
As the game started I began getting a little dizzy. I'd drunk plenty of water that day &amp; the day before so I thought maybe it was the heat. But then my eye sight started playing up. I was getting like tunnel vision, I couldn't focus on the ball or anything, I had no idea what was happening, the ref was making hand signals and I had no idea what was happening. Every step I was taking when I was running I was super aware of, like it was super bouncy. 
I took myself off before half time &amp; said my asthma was playing up (which it was in a way) &amp; then i went back on after half time &amp; I had no idea what way we were going.
I somehow got through the game."
Anxiety,"Feeling nauseous, dizzy and unable to eat for days.","I had a huge panic attack the other day due to taking more medication than I was supposed to which resulted in me going to the hospital. Now I feel dizzy and nauseous. Every time I get up I feel faint and light headed. My heart keeps racing really fast for no reason. I can’t eat without feeling very sick. I don’t know what to do, I can’t do anything except lie down feeling like this. It’s worth noting I’ve also had trouble sleeping. Also, there’s no way I’m pregnant and I had my blood tested at the hospital and everything came back normal."
Anxiety,Back to school anxiety,"I wrote an article on comparing [anxiety vs COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.pocketcoach.co/blog/anxiety-vs-coronavirus-symptoms/) and as a result, got a lot of requests from parents/caregivers who are finding it hard to explain anxiety to their children, as they are all going back to school. 

So, I wrote an article on how to do that, with some useful body maps and videos aimed specifically at children. 

We at [Pocketcoach](https://www.iamfeelinganxious.com/) write regularly on mental health topics. 

As always, open to feedback, comments and questions. Please let me know if it is useful"
Anxiety,Are people looking down at anxiety?,"Today was my third day in college, and so far it's been decent in terms of anxiety and such. Basically, I've not had any panic attacks as of yet. However, on my way to school today, I overheard these two girls talking with each other, and one said ""I feel calm when talking with you because you're not so nervous. Sometimes when talking with nervous people, you can kinda feel it and it becomes strange"". 

And right behind them, there I am, probably the most nervous person in the entire class because of intense social anxiety. It made me wonder if they told the truth, was this really what people thought of me?

And with this mindset, I tried talking to some people, and to no one's surprise, it was kinda awkward. I made some attempts to create a conversation, but more often than not It ended with silence. One guy even left me to talk with someone else, it felt horrible.

So my suspicions were confirmed, apparently, people do feel unpleasant when talking with me. For the entire break, I sat alone at a table, with the whole group only a couple of feet away, but I couldn't bring myself to join them, surely no one would actually enjoy the company.

So this is my life for the next three years huh, as if I'm not used to it. It's pain and suffering, and I somehow wish everything would work out, but the impression has already been made. Therapy has made it easier to deal with the whole situation but solving it, I wonder how that would be achieved.

I'm kinda scared of the future right now."
Anxiety,Feeling like a disappointment need to call out of work. Also how can you be more confident at work?,I have ibs and it’s really acting up right now and I know I can’t work but I feel like a terrible person to call out I’m only part time 16 hours each week I’ve only been working for 3 months and my social anxiety makes me very quiet and shy at work so I feel like people already don’t like me. I missed only 1 day so far but that was last week I’m feeling like a terrible person. Any advice on calling out sick to work or just being more confident and comfortable at work I try my best but I feel bad asking questions like I will annoy people.

Anxiety,Celexa vs Lexapro?,"Hello.  I have been on Celexa for about 16 years, only stopping it when I was pregnant and nursing.   It didn't seem to be helping my depression and anxiety disorders anymore.   I was switched to Lexapro about  2 months ago.  Since then, or it may have even been before switching, my anxiety has been at a level I've never known before and absolutely nothing eases it.  I just have to keep moving all day, from one thing to another, never feeling like I accomplish much.  I just wondered if anyone has experience with this?"
Anxiety,Increased Physical Anxiety,"Hi everyone. I just joined this sub and am struggling a bunch with my anxiety more than usual as of the last few months. I can barely eat meals without feeling like I have to throw up every bite because my anxiety is so terrible. Most of the time I don’t even know what specifically is making me feel such intense anxiety, it’s just always present. And some mornings like today I will wake up feeling like I’m on the brink of a panic attack, my heart racing and my stomach hurting quite badly. It’s really making life hard for me right now and I know a lot of people can relate with their anxiety and I’m really just looking for some tips and coping mechanisms. Anything to help! I’m really struggling out here"
Anxiety,I lost my keys,"I know the title makes this sound like a trivial thing, but it is genuinely terrifying. I had the key to my dorm and the key to my workplace on the same lanyard and I lost them both. 

It will cost over a hundred dollars to replace my dorm key since they would have to replace each lock in the entire dorm for security reasons. I could lose my job for losing these keys.

I can barely sleep, I’m not eating, I feel like I’m in some sort of deep dissociative state due to the confusion and anxiety. I honestly have no idea what could have happened, where they could be. It doesn’t make any sense."
Anxiety,"I'm exhausted, passing driving test seems impossible.","Even before taking driving lessons I had issues with mood, not a big talkie talkie, I don't know what it is, very rarely I go out. And I forget things a lot. I don't feel ashamed to tell you I've failed the test like 20 times at this point. It's eating me from inside and no matter what I try every time it feels the same.. Did multiple lessons before the test and I feel I can pass it but no. A lot of the time I did stupid mistakes that I did before. I have no problem controlling the car as this is the best thing the instructors can say about my test. Have any of you struggled so much? I've tried some drugs to calm me down, but none of them helped. Maybe street stuff can help me to not overthink? Have a nice day."
Anxiety,Trouble waking up in the morning possibly from anxiety?,"I work at 5:30am and I try to get up for work around 3:30, but the past couple months ive been having trouble getting up and out of bed so I sit and hit the snooze button till around 5 then rush my morning and spend extra money on breakfast and lunch  instead of making it before work like I planed. Once I'm up and at work I'm fine, but I have no motivation to get up on time. Any ideas?"
Anxiety,Late night solitude: messed up sleep schedule,"I like the solitude I have late at night when everyone has gone to bed and I have the house to myself.

Anxiety,"Please, what do I do","I'm not quite panicking but I have this horrible bowling ball feeling in my stomach. It's like everything is balled up in there, I almost feel nauseous from how anxious I am. But I'm not panicking. I'm just laying in bed not even able to cry.

Anxiety,Some big brain people have suggested that humans developed consciousness so that they could model and predict other humans actions/reactions in social situations.,"It seems like our brains may have taken it too far, and now all we can do is spend our time panicking about every possible outcome to any given conversation."
Anxiety,Does anyone take a very small dose of anxiety medicine?,I'm wondering if anyone has been prescribed a very small dose of anxiety medicine. My anxiety is usually mild but very persistent. I don't want meds to have a very significant effect on how I feel but I'd like some anxiety relief.

Anxiety,I don’t know how to handle this anymore.,"My environment right now is making my anxiety worser than ever. There’s always problem after problem, CONSTANT shouting and cussing around the house. I feel like Im absorbing all their problems, it’s affecting not just me but my siblings too. Im keeping it all to myself for months, whenever I try to tell this to my mom she would cuss at me and tell me that Im just fishing for attention. Im under 20 btw some of you might think that I should just move out but Im not from America lol, here in my country they don’t usually hire applicants that are below 20 especially right now because of the pandemic. I still can’t support my needs so I have to stay in this house and endure all the emotional pain and trauma that my mother is causing me. I really miss school, Im forced to stay in this house because of the fucking pandemic. This house  should feel like home but instead this is where I am constantly being called stupid and useless. I can’t even tell my own mom about how I feel, she would say that Im just being dramatic. I don’t know how to handle this anymore. Im exhausted"
Anxiety,Missed lexapro,"I tried to cut lexapro down from 10 mg to 5 mg. Long story short I cut down cold turkey in a few days.

I hate this feeling :("
Anxiety,Anyone else have a nervous habbit of scratching at their head?,"Ok so I guess I wouldn't actually describe it as scratching, but if I'm sitting still I feel this absolute need to run my hands through my hair or like rub at spots in my scalp to feel the hair against my fingers where it joins into my skin because it feel prickly. I've been doing this for as long as I can remember and im just wondering if it's related to my anxiety or just something everyone in general does"
Anxiety,Does anyone esle feel like their brain has a cold?,"I don't know how else to describe this, it's not brain fog nor a headache but it hurts in a non-painful weird way. I think I always feel it after moments of intense overthinking."
Anxiety,I feel guilty trying to avoid my triggers,"I recently unfollowed one of my friends because they keep posting/retweeting about issues that absolutely triggers me, that made me feel guilty, i’ve always felt guilty when trying to avoid anything related to that issue, it makes me recognize my privilege in having the chance to “not participate” in it, to choose to not read about it, see it, interact or bring awareness to it.


I feel like because i’m privileged, and because i’m, along with many, are effected by this, i should be participating more than anyone, i feel like i can’t call myself a “supporter” when all i do is look the other way when i see sth related to the issue.

But i feel so fucking done with the world if i see even a post related to that, i feel so helpless and think that there’s absolutely no way out of this, i hate my life, i cry all day, i think back to it whenever i’m left alone with no distractions for 5 mins, i hate this."
Anxiety,I just asked a question in lecture.,"It was relevant, prof was happy to answer and learned something about a really neat subject. No opportunity at all for embarrassment or failure of any kind. You could even say it went about as well as a question can. 

It has destroyed me internally so much that I am fighting to not leave lecture. Wringing hands, replaying the question and response over and over. I'm honestly not even worried about anything and I still feel awful. Writing this to distract myself from the urge to FLEE the zoom session. 

wtf even is emotion and how do I turn it off?"

Anxiety,Anyone Else Have Changing Anxiety Symptoms?,"Hi Everyone.  Just looking to see if changing symptoms are common.  I dealt with anxiety and panic about 4 years ago.  The main symptom was dizziness along with some brain zaps.  During this time I was dealing with a lot of changes.  I just got married, had a kid, bought a house, and started a new job.  

About three months ago, the brain zaps started coming back, along with some uneasy feelings.  The dizziness this time has been minimal, but there have been a lot more shooting pain in my ears and head.  Also the worst part is headaches that last for days.  

The odd thing is I can see how all the stress lead to the anxiety before, but this time, life is pretty stable.  Has anyone else experienced a relapse with different symptoms?"
Anxiety,I'm trying to decide whether or not i should kill myself,"My life's a mess.
I can't do this anymore.
I'm not good enough.
I don't want to go to school ever again.
I don't have the courage to say when something's bothering me.
I don't want to go home."
Anxiety,I told my work about my creepy coworker and they did something about it! I ASKED FOR HELP! :D,"There is this strange guy at work who has took advantage of my doormat, anxiety-ridden self, such as taking me off shift 5 hours early to coerce me into his car, moving me into his section so he can look at me, and constantly send me streams of texts... i guess the nightmare fuel of the whole situation got to me, and i explained this to management and now I'm mostly fine! Management moves me to work in areas far away from him, they don't let him near me, etc... I no longer feel too anxious at work anymore and I'm beginning to come out of my shell a little :) im so grateful and happy. Maybe people arent as bad as i thought."
Anxiety,"Going to my therapist for the first time after the lockdown and for some reason I feel EXTREMELY anxious, like I've had three panic attacks today","and I don't even get why???
any words of reassurance would be appreciated :("
Anxiety,Luvox,"I went to the doctor yesterday to have medication prescribed for my severe anxiety/OCD/depression. She very quickly suggested Luvox, almost surprised that I was suggested it before, and gave me a prescription to start me on 50mg a day. When I got home and google searched I saw that it was discontinued back in 2002 due to the boy who was involved in the Columbine shooting being on it. I have an appointment with my psychologist today and I’m going to ask him his opinion on it but I’m curious if anyone else has had experience with it? Anyone been on meds that they feel truly helped them? I was on Zoloft for a while and it worked wonders for me until it didn’t. I am terrified to be on meds because of the side effects but almost equally as terrified of how I feel on a regular basis without it. I’m just scared and so tired of this :("
Anxiety,Sometimes it feels so terrible 😒,
Anxiety,Can't drive due to anxiety,"Does anyone else get really anxious while driving a car? I know how to drive and I've got my license, but I CAN'T drive. I start shaking so bad and having to pay attention to your surroundings while also paying attention to the pedals and everything...I just can't. I do not necessarily need to drive, but it would be nice to ble able to.

I have driven a motorcycle before and I had no problem with it, maybe driving a motorcycle could be an option?"
Anxiety,I'm not having a good day,"We just had a very small earthquake here last night at 2 am. My apartment shook a bit, and the floor was buzzing, but it only lasted about 5 seconds. I had no idea wtf was going on, but it still freaked me out. It was only a 3.3 or so, but it was enough to make me start to panic. It doesn't help that I had just finished Bojack Horseman that night and was already feeling kinda raw emotionally. I laid there in bed with my eyes wide open listening to binaural beats feeling extremely uneasy for a few hours until I finally passed out around 4:30. 8:40 rolls around and my alarm goes off, I groggily get myself dressed and head to work, and I can feel that my pulse is still going really fast - about 140 bpm resting. Now I'm confined to my desk at work still feeling extremely anxious and haven't been able to take a full, deep breath for the whole day. I have to endure this for another 6 and a half or so hours until I can go back home and hopefully sleep a little more.

I hope you guys are having a better day."
Anxiety,"Feeling down on myself, rejected, and anxious ... how to pick myself (24F) back up","I was seeing a guy (28M) for around 2 months this summer... long story short, he started distancing himself a bit. One night he ghosts me after texting to make plans and lies that he didn't have his phone on him, and I confronted him for ignoring me because I could see him on social media.

I regret even confronting him because I feel like it pushed him away more. Anyway fast forward 5 days and he texts me to see what I'm doing, but I was with my friends so he said to have fun and he'll text me the next day.... Then the entire LDW goes by and I didn't hear anything from him. Yesterday he texts to have a short conversation about what we did over the weekend and then apologizes for ghosting me a week ago. I reply just a few sentences saying it was ok and that it just made me feel stupid (my phone was broken so i was thinking it was bc of that and not him ignoring me at first). Then he just doesn't reply anymore....

I am feeling like he only apologized to me to get it off of his conscience so then he can completely ghost me and not feel bad about himself. I am feeling so rejected and regret ever even confronting him. Deep down I know I deserve better and that I did nothing wrong in confronting him, but I'm still upset about it."
Anxiety,Anxious about applying for jobs,"I am unemployed for some months. I have to get a job, but I'm anxious about applying. I'm not so worried about the job interview, but about doing something wrong. Applying and maybe accepting the wrong job.
I also don't really know what I would like to do. 
I think I'm afraid of being ""stuck"" with one decision.
Does anyone else know this? How did you overcome it?"
Anxiety,My Dr finally believed me,"I used to be on 12m clonazapam a day for years, but when I was worried about my memory problems I quit cold turkey in 2017

I started having absolutely crippling panic attacks and my dr just didn’t believe how bad they were

I had such a bad panic attack yesterday I’m finally back on them, only this time I don’t care if they kill me, I’m not getting off them in case I end up in a horror movie with crippling untreated daily panic attacks again."
Anxiety,Anxious college student,I just started my 3rd year of college and first year at a new school after transferring. I’ve always struggled with staying organized but this year has been especially hard dealing with COVID and the new school. My anxiety has been spiking and throws my brain into complete disarray and I can’t think to get things done. Does anyone have advice for staying better organized and/or managing stress and anxiety better in college?
Anxiety,Random attacks with seemingly no trigger?,"I don’t know why it keeps happening but I’ve started having random panic attacks for seemingly no reason. I could be cooking or doing laundry and start feeling panicked. Even in class ill have one when I’m just doing work. 

I’ve never had this issue (Atleast this bad) before and I don’t know how to calm myself down."
Anxiety,Is my medication causing my anxiety?,"So long story short I went my whole 26 years not knowing what real anxiety felt like. After my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer it hit me like a tonne of bricks and it’s still here 4 years on. My mum passed In October and I’m still grieving but I’m getting there. I started to wonder that even though my mum has passed, the feeling of worry I had for 4 years is gone because she’s at peace now. I didn’t have anxiety before and I am so reliant on Pregabalin to stabilise my mood but I think I’m worse because of it, like I wake up every morning and I feel the lowest of the low, I take 400mg of Pregabalin and exactly one hour later I’m the life and soul of the party so to speak... even though I hate leaving the house now. So I’ve spoken to my doctor and I told him I want to start from scratch with this and come off everything as I’m also on dihydrocodeine and propranolol. He was thrilled that I came to this decision so we’re reducing everything gradually over time. The main reason for this is that when I’m happy, sad, angry etc I want those feelings to be natural and not only be there because medication is making them there. Even with the meds it improves my mood drastically but I still get anxious, I have it right now as I type this but I’m happy at the same time and that is purely because of the Pregabalin. I want my feelings to be the real me and not chemically altered. I was a happy, loving, kind, nutter of a girl and now I don’t recognise myself. Has anyone experienced this process or something similar? Just want to know if I’m onto something by coming off everything and starting fresh. Thanks ✌🏻x"
Anxiety,Unexplained Anxiety feelings from nowhere (23yo Male),"Hi,

I am posting this because the situation has been very unusual for me and I am keen to see if others have had similar things happen or at least give comfort to people if they are going through the same thing that they aren't alone.

Happened in June I lost my libido literally out of nowhere. Work was good, life was great in a solid relationship for a few months and bang just suddenly went. Thought it may be stress though wasn't particularly stressed at all. Didn't let it bother me regardless just thought it may be one of those things that goes and comes back.

About two weeks later spent two days feeling very tired at work and slept a lot in the evening (bed at 9pm waking up at 8am). Then out the blue Thursday evening in bed had this anxiety attack that just felt purely physical. My heart was beating hard, was having these waves of this anxious feeling through my body, acidic stomach and hot flashes. I was awake the entire night and have slept shocking since, maybe 3/4 hours a night.

Given I did not feel stressed during this period and my mind felt calm but my body was going crazy I presumed it must be something physical that was wrong, like a virus or something. Initial tests at the Drs returned nothing and over the next few weeks I lost A LOT of weight promoting my work to advise me to have more tests at the doctors. After seeing a private consultant, everything came back again normal. I have also been seeing a counsellor since the week after the initial event and he continues to say he cannot see a psychological cause for all of this and was one of the people who prompted me to get further tests because he presumed something physical.

It has all been a bit surreal because I have never had anything like this before in my life. I am a pretty care-free easy going person who deals with anything adverse very well. The fact that it has been so physical and I have no idea how to tame what it going on when my mind is calm and that there are no answers is scary. 

Has anyone ever had anything similar to this? If not I hope this gives a bit of support to anyone out there who may going through their own struggles.

For those interested I am a 23yo Male from the UK."
Anxiety,"Religion, existence, and being overwhelmed","I’m 14, and recently, I’ve been thinking of death, and ceasing to exist scares me. I am also a Christian, and raised like that, but I always think, “it’s scary to die, and what if I’m wrong about religion?” Also reading about reincarnation, it seems so confusing, weird, interesting, and stressful. I’m nervous about what happens after death, and about wasting my time and growing up."

Anxiety,I had an anxiety attack in the middle of my class discussion today,"I just got back from my English lecture and I feel awful about my participation. 

We were discussing the topic of history and how the facts that history presents can often be biased. I tried something I don't usually do, which is speaking out when I'm not called on because the professor said it was okay and I wanted to come out of my comfort zone a bit. Mid- sentence, I started stuttering and losing my train of thought. I had a well-thought out response with a reference to the page number on the reading and everything but when the time came to say it, I couldn't. I feel like no one understood what I was saying, and it just got swept under the rug. After my bit, another kid came in and was like, ""wasn't the question *this?"" a*s if I wasn't on topic. For me, it was horrifying and made me feel like my voice didn't matter. How come when I write, my thoughts are so much more clear and understandable, but when I speak, I'm invisible?

I know I shouldn't beat myself up too bad for something small like this, but I've really been trying to just not give a f\*ck and say what I want. But how come when I do, I actually can't? 

On top of that, this is a course I have experience with because I took a similar course years ago when I was a freshman in college and I have to take it again to apply to this business school. I feel ashamed that these younger kids seem so much more put together than I am. I thought my emotional and intellectual confidence would be so much better by now but it isn't."

Any guidance?  Anyone been through this before?  The waiting and anxiety is paralyzing.

Anxiety,"What do you do to feel better, when you’re very anxious?","I have an exam in two days and the material I must learn is too much. Because of this, my anxiety is killing me right now and I need some tips on how to stop it, because I must study, but it won’t let me.

Anxiety,Coming off meds and I feel sick to my stomach all the time,"I have been coming off Zoloft for the past month (slowly, not cold turkey) and I have been feeling sick to my stomach and scared to go outside to do thing that I need to do because I don’t want to get even more sick while I’m out.

Anxiety,Major panic issues going back to work,"Hey all, just hoping to vent a little bit.

I have always been a little high strung, but my anxiety has always been mostly manageable, and has usually been of the ""pre-show jitters"" kind of anxiety. Once I'm actually in a given situation, I am okay.

With Covid quarantine, I adapted very well, as I'm sure a lot of you have. I am a homebody, and no real work or leaving the house was a blessing for my anxieties, despite the stresses of the virus.

I've been back at work for a few days now, just for a few hours a day working with animals, and my anxiety is the worst it has ever been.

I can't sleep without sleeping meds, even if I am exhausted from exercise, I feel so anxious when I wake up I can't eat anything and feel like throwing up, and I just came back from work and am so anxious I feel like I might have a panic attack. I don't even really know why. Maybe it is the stressful subway commutes. Maybe it is the fact that working with animals can be difficult. I don't know. It's much less work or stress than I was doing before Covid. 

Anxiety of this level is very new to me, and holy shit, this is awful. I'm just hoping a few people read this and can sympathize. I have a newfound appreciation for the difficulties people with long term anxiety disorders have been going through."
Anxiety,Issues with therapists,Does anyone else try and go to therapy for anxiety and just get too anxious talking to the therapist? I start to panic then overthink everything and can’t organize my thoughts to talk to them. Is this just because I haven’t found the right therapist yet? It just seems to make me feel worse when I go to to one.
Anxiety,Does anyone else stop eating when they’re stressed/anxious?,"I have pretty basic Generalized Anxiety (in my opinion). I’ve been going through a lot of stress with my work changing around A LOT (like a lot of people are feeling now). I feel like I’m coping pretty well with all of it and I feel outwardly relaxed and capable, except that I cannot force myself to eat ANYTHING while I’m at work. Every time I think about eating, even something I like, I feel like gagging. I literally feel like I can’t swallow food or It’ll come back up. Has anyone experienced this and if so do you have any advice on how to overcome this??"
Anxiety,Somebody can help me to discuss this idea? (it is part of my theraphy),"**Summary:**

**I want to get convinced that the only thing world is requesting for me is having a great time... but I can't get out of my head the idea of being someone with a ""special mission""**

Hi guys, I am using Cognitive Theraphy to cope with the stress in my life.

And I realize a idea that is stressing me, its overwhelming me in some way.

Its the idea that I have an special talent and knowledge to cure, or to improve, mental illness.

In fact, I am diagnosed schizophrenia and I am working and taking very low meds, but in the afternoon I blame myself for not helping others, as I think I have something special to the world to say.

The special thing is that the therapy works a lot even in my mental illness, schizophrenia (I know a lot of diag-mates who only trust in meds and they are trying over and over). I tried theraphy in books (Albert Ellis, Rafael Santandreu) and in apps (Woebot) and that improve a lot my condition, nowadays I have a job and a girlfriend. Also I have studied Psychologies (5 years) but it is very difficult to get a job of it, and I think my ""knowledge"" is being wasted

But, in the afternoons I only play CS GO, go for a walk, and see my friends (I work in the morning as a computer technician). And I think I would study for creating an app or a book to help people. Actually I am learning to create apps (or I should be) but it's too dificult for me

&amp;#x200B;

But I think the reality is that Cognitive Therapy is not for everybody, I am not specially intelligent (I find listening people for more than two hours really exhausting); I think there are a lot of people with the illness doing better than me (they got stressing jobs like nursery) so I am actually not special and the world doesnt need me appart from my family and friends"
Anxiety,I feel like i can’t go on like this,"TW anxiety suicidal throughs 

I’m in quarantine for a week due to being in contact with someone who has COVID (I’m not from USA ) so I can’t even go buy myself some cigarettes so I’m sitting here in my shitty flat after crying for  40 minutes straight.

Today I was suppose to have my math tutoring thing through Skype, and I actually had a couple of things I needed to look at. I was anxious over it for the whole day and then when it did started the worst I feared happened - I was too anxious to actually pay attention and then I suppose I forgot how to breath so I started having a panic attack twenty minutes in. Panicked, I turned off the call, then texted my tutor that it’ll be all for today’s class. Then I cried for 40 minutes. I can’t go outside. I can’t do this anymore. I’m so tired of living like this. My anxiety and depression are killing me. I can’t do anything. I can’t go anywhere. Nothing brings me pleasure at all, ever. I’m sick of this. 

How am I suppose to go on? My meds doesn’t do shit, I can’t find a therapist for a year now and here I am, stuck at home. Through, even if I wasn’t its not like I have anyone to meet with. Thanks to my great anxiety I have managed to live 18 years and still never make a single friend :) good job, me. 

I can’t do this anymore. I try very hard everyday to not give up on life yet but I can’t fucking find anything worth sticking around for. 

I always end up like this, miserable and anxious and lonely and depressed. So. That’s how it is."
Anxiety,I was taught that doomsday was imminent as a kid. Now all that repressed fear is coming up,"I grew up in what I would call a doomsday cult. I was taught the end was coming and god is going to destroy anyone who isn’t apart of the religion, basically. I don’t believe anymore. But I’m currently visiting my family in Portland and with the pandemic, riots and boarded up downtown, crazy wildfires all over the west coast and my family surrounding me with constant talk of how they knew this was going to happen, it’s led to me having panic attacks. I’ve dealt with anxiety my whole life, from severe to mild, but haven’t ever talked to a doctor about it. Now it’s getting bad and I’m here with my family for a couple more weeks. I go from feeling normal and fine to having trouble breathing and feeling my heart pounding out of chest. It’s overwhelming sometimes. I’m an environmental educator and spend all my time learning, teaching, helping in that field. It’s also sickening for me to be actually trying to be helpful in the world, while my family rolls their eyes at me and tells me it’s useless, yet looks at me with vindication and triumph when they here reports on the news that the fires in Oregon and Cali are the worst in history. Maybe this is just a rant but I think I need some advice or help"
Anxiety,Physical anxiety symptoms are exhausting..,"Hey all! M21. I been having physical anxiety symptoms quite a few years now, (well actually since 13 y.o, (to some degree) I'm also taking medication- Ssri (which have helped to cope with it a lot better) and also been to group therapy, individual etc, but still there seem to be days where I'm struggling sometimes. My anxiety symptoms usually start after social situations or tiring day (at least I think so) and they can last for weeks or sometimes even months: headache/migraine- all other possible body aches, stomach problems, nausea, heightened sense of smell, feeling cold, visual snow and so on.. Also constant hand washing is pretty usual thing for me, to the point where hands are already bloody, probably small signs of OCD aswell next to health and social anxiety. It has somewhat ruined my life badly to finish stuff what I've started, but it is what it is and need to accept it. Constant workout is helping me though, it keeps up routine and mind off from stuff and surely I enjoy it. Also picked up Field Target shooting and joined its club too- which forces me to socialise a bit more than I usually do despite somedays feeling like crap. Thanks for reading it all, just had to let it out. 
If there's anyone else with similar condition, you can type your story here or if you have any good tips to share to cope with it. I've heard it will also help a lot if you know you aren't alone out there with it. 
 You can always message me, if you feel like you wanna talk. Stay strong everyone, peace. :)"
Anxiety,Anyone have relationship induced anxiety?,"I'm in a long distance relationship and it gives me a lot of anxiety being so far away and not being able to have that physical closeness, and having to rely on just words and seeing each other every other month or so triggers it.  I'm usually okay in the evenings, its during the day that I struggle with the anxiety and chest tightness, etc.

Anyone else have something similar that triggers their anxiety?"
Anxiety,I’m super anxious right now :(,"I almost didn’t sleep last night. Every day I read or listen to news that makes me anxious. But, Now I’m more anxious than ever. For me, I either be anxious all the time or don’t listen to news and don’t get anxious at all. There is nothing in between for me. This is incredibly concerning to me. There doesn’t seem to be a solution for me. I either get ignorant of current events in the world or be anxious all the time."

Anxiety,A vent/rant about my declining mental health (warning - long post ahead!),"**TW for suicide/self-harm stuff**

This is a new account/throwaway and I've posted in this community before, albeit on an account I have since deleted. To cut to the chase, I want to vent about the decline of my mental health over the last eleven months or so. Do be mindful that this is going to be lengthy.

It started in around October last year, when I was a month or so into my second year of university. My first year had been fantastic, and I genuinely felt like I was living my best life. Then the panic attacks started, with no trigger that I was able to discern. They'd happen when I was just minding my own business - playing video games or walking down the street. In one scenario, I very nearly blacked out crossing a road. I've never been a super sociable person and I've had an Autism spectrum diagnosis since I was  a child, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced something on this level. I only felt safe when I was in class on campus - and some days, I struggled to even walk myself there.

Feeling safe on campus started to become a little bit more tricky around November. I was sitting in class one afternoon when a vile, biting though popped into my head. My brain was telling myself to gouge out my own eyes, right then and there. All I'd been doing was listening to a classmate delivering a presentation. So, I tried it. Pushed my fingers in deep. This triggered another panic attack and I had to leave the room to calm down. Nobody saw me do it.

I managed to forget about this until a week later, when being in the same room reminded me of the experience. In early December, I travelled home for my winter break and the very first evening back at my house the thought came back to me. And didn't stop coming back. I was convinced that I was going to blind myself my Christmas, spending hours on hours researching eye injuries and such. It became an obsession. It turns out it's nigh on impossible for a person of sound mind to destroy their own eyes like that, but I was still convinced. One day in early January, I got out of the shower and told myself that if it was so easy, I might as well get it over and done with. I knelt on my floor naked, dripping wet, and pushed my fingers into my eyes as deep as they could go. Other than a racing pulse, I was fine. I called my dad to tell him what I'd done. The next week or so was uneventful, and I was prescribed glasses for an unrelated reason which made my eyes feel better protected for an increment of time.

Later that month I returned to campus, and the thoughts came back. I spent every day for months convinced that I could take my own vision, and it got to the point that I was excusing myself from class to try it in the bathrooms. Around this time, I started consulting for CBT through my university's student services, but there was an eight week waiting list.

During these eight weeks, I was plagued my more thoughts and convictions. I thought I could break my own neck, just by standing there and turning it as far as I could. Again, pretty much impossible, but I was still convinced in spite of my hours of research to the contrary. My CBT finally started the day my university closed because of lockdown, though I found it to be of little relief. By the time I started it was telephone appointments, which I find more difficult than talking to someone in person.

Months went by at home, and the more dangerous my thoughts became in spite of my weekly therapy sessions. I began to engage in risky behaviours just because I could - one one occasion, I inhaled deodorant in the bathroom for reasons that I can't even recall. I was not trying to get high.

I figured out a means to electrocute myself using household appliances, and I started to hide things. My intrusive thoughts became all the more elaborate as time went on, as against my will I would come up with increasingly bizarre and abstract means to kill or maim myself. I experimented hanging with belts, and strangling myself with everything from bathrobes to earphones. All this time, and to this day, I do *not* want to die. I am terrified of death. And that's one of the things people struggle to understand about my condition.

Things came to a head in May, when I unscrewed the lightbulb in my room, turned it on at the switch, and thrust my fingers into the sockets. Needless to say, I got a shock. I told my parents immediately what I'd done, and they contacted a doctor who instructed me to go to my local A&amp;E. So I did, and was first spoken to by the crisis team who told me to come back the next day to speak to a psychiatrist. 

The psychiatrist himself was great, and convinced me to go on medication (something I'd been anxious about previously). I was not diagnosed with anything in particular, but the psychiatrist said that I should be pursuing a similar treatment to that used for OCD. I was put on 20mg fluoxetine/Prozac, and the psychiatrist informed me that he'd contact me for a follow-up after three months. Three months have passed, and there has been no follow-up. 

Since then, I feel like my condition has worsened. I finished my six weeks course of CBT, and a university counsellor has been contacting regularly for updates. I think the medication was working, at least for a short period of time. The intrusive thoughts were less frequent, but became far more stark and realistic. There were days when I woke up and tied a bedsheet around my neck, the other end hooked to a wardrobe or curtain rail. I've since removed the rails from my wardrobe, and pulled on the curtain rail so it can no longer take my weight without collapsing. My parents have had to hide cleaning chemicals because I was hounded by thoughts of drinking them and/or dousing myself. 

Over the past month or so, I've noticed that I've been feeling manic. Staying up late riding creative urges, laughing at nothing in particular, and become both talkative and argumentative. Sometimes I find myself pacing around in the early hours, lecturing or conversing with myself and thinking up existential theories that both disturb and comfort me. Whether I fully believe these is hard to say.

A few weeks ago,, I went to the park with my friend as has become routine for me over the last few months, and I felt like I had lost control of myself. I started laughing at and repeating the most immature jokes, and at one point followed a random guy down a path just to find out if he really *did* have the Burger King logo on his hat as he cycled past. I got close enough to realise that it was not, in fact, the Burger King logo, but at the time it felt imperative to find out. Leaving the park, I started looking at the clouds and the trees, which struck me as profound. I couldn't put my finger on what was different about them, but they just felt... different to me. Like I was seeing things through some kind of brand new lens. Around that week, I was finding coincidences everywhere. Bizarre recurrences that made me hunt for a meaning that I was unable to find.

Since that day, I've not quite been feeling the same. The next day I struggled to focus, and randomly became fixated on digging out my old model trains that I'd not played with in close to a decade. I found them with help of my dad, and a day later I'd spent around £150 on some new trains and rolling stock. 

In the weeks since, I've been lapsing out of these sorta uplifting periods and my usual, pseudo-suicidal bullshit. Nothing quite the same as that afternoon at the park, but I've been noticing changes; mundane dreams that I confuse with reality, and in the waking hours a ringing in my ears and intense moments where reality seems to ""shift"". Sometimes I'll have politically-charged dreams, from which I wake up feeling radicalised (further left than I usually am) yet powerless to make any kind of difference. On my birthday, I dreamt that my family in friends ignored me in lieu of holding a party for a neo-Nazi who'd committed a racially-motivated murder and bragged about it. In the dream, I broke down in tears. After waking up that morning, I had a similar run-in with my bedsheet and the closet. During all of this, I was hoping that the psychiatrist would contact me back. He did not.

A week ago, I contacted my GP, who told me that a psychiatrist would contact me within the week. Her theory was that the medication might be causing this, and that perhaps my dosage needs to be increased, which I don't understand. I was given an email address to use to contact psychiatric people directly (the GP said it was out of her jurisdiction), and I guess that I'll have to do that now since a week has passed and I've heard nothing back. I'm getting desperate.

Some days I feel okay. Other days I feel like I'd be better off in hospital. My mental state is causing tension between myself and my parents, who it feels like are twisting the things I say. For example, I told the GP that my parents don't always understand how I feel, and later I heard my mum ranting to my dad that I'd told the doctor that they ""don't care"". I just don't feel right. The scariest part for me is how quickly this escalated, and without any specific triggers. Frankly, it's absolutely terrifying and I feel like I am being tortured by my own mind. Sometimes it feels like reality is in a regressive state; like one of my suicide ""attempts"" was successful, and what I'm now experiencing is a residual version of reality. Think Philip K Dick's *Ubik*. Recently I've been reading his book *VALIS,* a semi-autobiographical reflection on his years of psychosis, and I'm kinda disturbed by how much I can relate to some of what he wrote. I've read anecdotes from people with psychosis who experienced a prodromal phase with a similar escalation of symptoms to what I've been going through. My grandmother is eccentric, and from what I've heard from my mother, my great-grandmother was almost certainly delusional to a serious degree but went undiagnosed. And, without getting into too much detail for privacy reasons, a member of the same side of the family from my parents' generation went on to commit murder during a psychotic episode. Yet my brother and cousins on this side are all mentally sound, which makes me very paranoid that I might have inherited something. I don't hear voices per se (though I'd say my thoughts are loud and critical) and I don't have anything I'd *quite* consider a delusion, but it feels like I'm just one step on the other side of that threshold. Perhaps this is just my anxiety. Perhaps it's psychosomatic. But the one thing I know for certain is that I don't feel safe anymore, and I've not felt safe for many months now. I don't know how people can live like this - I feel like I've unlocked some darker version of reality, a kind of ""truth"" superimposed over what most people see, where everything poses a danger and nothing properly calms me down. You could lock me in a room with nothing but a padded room and floor and I'd still figure out some way to kill or seriously hurt myself. Hell, I could do it right now without even leaving my chair, I think.

In short, I am not well. Mental health services seem to just throw you round and round in pointless circles. I want to know if this is anxiety, OCD, or the onset of something more sinister entirely. It frightens me how suddenly this started, and how quickly it's escalated into the clusterfuck that I'm living in right now. All it seems I can do is take my Prozac every morning and hope for the best. I'll be trying that email address tonight."
Anxiety,Helping those suffering from persistent medically unexplained physical symptoms,"Hi everyone,

Some years ago, I have developed persistent unexplained physical symptoms after having an aspiration pneumonia. These symptoms lasted years and disabled my life tremendously. A list of the most prominent:

\- a general malaise feeling that comes and goes in waves but is pretty constant sometimes. It's definitely hard to describe. Sometimes it feels like persistent nausea but without vomiting sensation. Other times it would feel more like having fever. This was the most unbearable disabling thing of all.

\- head pressure and feeling of stretch in the head

\- Lights at night seemed too bright and vivid. Not in the sense of light sensitivity, I could look at them with no problem but they just felt too contrasted

\- shortness of breath that would come and go at random times - feeling like not being able to take a deep breath

\-muscle twitches/eye twitches

\-feeling of electricity/tingling through the body

I have long term anxiety disorder and I was used to the more typical symptoms of anxiety when psychologically anxious, but this was a whole new beast since the symptoms persisted at all times independently of my state at the moment. After multiple exams, doctors would either diagnose me with generalized anxiety, somatoform disorder or OCD. Different doctors would give different diagnoses.  After lots of research, I found several conditions/labels with different criteria that would have equally vague neurological symptoms and would in part suit my situation (ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, ""chronic lyme"", functional neurological disorder) but never something that I could really identify myself with. After 2 years, I can say I have improved a lot, even though I am not sure which measures played the major role in improving my condition. I am here looking to help anyone suffering with something similar as I went through it and it was hell. Feel free to contact me if you find yourself in a similar situation."

Anxiety,"I don’t know what to do, help!","So since the beginning of the school year (started Aug. 12th) I haven’t joined a zoom meeting for my chemistry class (I’ve joined for my other classes but just not chem) I’m TERRIFIED to join now because you have to show your face and it’s going to be awkward + I feel like everyone will be starring at me. 

So what in the hell should I do?!"
Anxiety,Physical symptoms flaring?,"Hi all! 

I don’t know if much background info is really needed. But I’ve been diagnosed (for a long time) with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, &amp; panic attack disorder. 

I’m 100% slacking in self-care and I KNOW that’s the best way to improve the symptoms... but my question is -

Why do my physical symptoms like (nausea, diarrhea, headaches, shortness of breath) sometimes flare up (to the point I completely stop everything I’m doing bc I can only focus on that) and then other times they feel way more manageable and super easy to just brush off?

- is there any way to manage this? Help!"
Anxiety,Pregabalin/Lyrica,"Anyone had any success with this medication for anxiety? Would be good to hear some success or positive stories
Thanks"
Anxiety,Is this an anxiety attack or something else?,"So a few years ago I had my first 'anxiety attack' (please correct me if what is incorrect for an anxiety attack). I was on the bus to school and I was worrying about my options and how the wrong options could lead to me not being able to do the job I want to do in the future and my thoughts kind of just spiraled from there and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I tried to tell myself to just take a deep breath but it was like I forgot how to breathe. I just couldn't breathe which made me worry even more because I thought I was going to die, then after a minute or two I managed to take a gasp of air when it felt like I would pass out if I didn't get some oxygen.

Since then, this has happened to me a few times when I listen to music in my headphones on loud when I'm on public transport or I've often found my chest feeling hollow/tight when I answer the phone or meet new people or sometimes for no obvious reason at all. Is this anxiety? Me just being overly worried? Or is it something else?"
Anxiety,Wake Up frequently with racing thoughts.,"English is not my first language, please be supportive and I am sorry for that.

I wake up frequently with racing thoughts, fast heartbeat and  unreasonable rage. Other symptoms are eyes shaking (not frequently).

I have been under stress and have anxiety issues from last 5 years, but it has been 3 years since a bully beat me up, but I am not able to forget that incident. Now, though he don't get physical but whenever he is always trying to insult me. Tbh, I kind of wanted to revenge but I didn't know why it is now getting a big deal. It is the only thing that I am not able to move on. I have not had a good sleep since months. My daily schedule is not so-consistent. It has now started to affect my academics and career. I am not able to focus on things of importance. Now I don't if chronic prostatis is also a by-product of this ruined mental health as I am only 22.

Please enlighten. How can I heal myself?"

Anxiety,Anyone took Etifoxin here ?,"Hi ! I'm new on this subreddit, and actually, it's totally new for me to speak of my anxiety to people.
First of all I'm sorry if I make some writing mistakes, my english is not really perfect.
I'm suffering from severe anxiety, and bad bad agoraphobia since more than 1,5 year. It's almost an incapacity to go out of my place; I do what's necessary to survive, but no going out with friends and all, in fact, since I had this anxiety, all my friends went tired of my anxiety problems really fast and I'm alone in much of my time. I was able to work too because I was an healthcare assistant for 10 months, and work wasn't much a problem for me because you're more «independent». but now since a week, I came back to school and.. here's the big trouble. Scholarship is really hard for me, except the fact that I have to go out of my place, I feel traped in those classroom, like, cannot escape, too much people, etc. Yesterday was a really bad day, I couldn't go in class and just felt like shit for that.
So I went to see a doctor, a new one because I had to move out to go to school. He prescribed me «Etifoxin» (mine is called Stresam, etifoxin is the molecule), I had this treatment two times for a month and three months respectively, but I would like to have some of your advice; did it worked great on you ? This doctor was like, really against ««real»» anxiolytics, like benzos, would you advice not to take some, too ? 

I don't know if it's the right place to post that but thank y'all for reading this, hope it's understandable again !"
Anxiety,"Anxious as shit, is there a way to get caffeine out of your body quicker","I thought I could handle an iced coffee before bed but now I’m feeling minutes away from a panic attack and I’m in public, can anyone offer some solutions or solid help? I’m beginning to depersonalize as well, wanting to lock myself in a bathroom stall"
Anxiety,I'm so tired,"I have felt so empty lately.  I can feel myself being worn down and I'm trying to do everything I am suppose to do to help it. I am trying my best to stay positive, I exercise, I meditate, I eat a healthy diet. I see a therapist.

My fibro has been acting up lately so i'm in constant physical pain.  My wife has been amazing and I really am terrified to imagine what id do without her.  I get about 3 to 4 hours of sleep per night and my wife tells me I twitch in my sleep. 

I lost a 16 year career in healthcare to this mental illness and I feel like I am slowly losing my mind.  Ive been on and off meds for the last 4 years and im tired of feeling medicated. I dont even like feeling high on the medical weed that i vape. I see no joy in slowing losing my cognition. I forget things lately and i know it scares my wife.

I try to help people, its the only thing that gives me joy. I use to be really good at it. Now I can't even stop my left arm from twitching. I hate the way I must look to people. I am ashamed.  I use to work in the ER and I know how people talk about people like us.

I am scared to even leave my house. I hate loud noises, crowds... I moved from NYC to a significantly smaller city in PA. I hate that I put my wife through this because she is truly my only sanity. 

I have to sit across from another shrink next month and after being denied ssdi already, have to explain all these feelings to them, just to get denied again.  I miss working, I want to work. It defined me. Its 3am and I need to attempt to sleep again. If you've made it this far reading this, thank you for letting me vent."
Anxiety,Crazy bad anxiety over used mattress/bedbugs. Scared,"I'm moving out soon, and I wanted to buy a new mattress for myself, but my parents bought me a mattress off of Craigslist without telling me until a while after they bought it. I don't know for how much. It might have been free. I'm grateful for their help, but I would have preferred to buy my own new, cheap mattress off of Amazon or something. I'm germaphobic and terrified of used mattresses because of bed bugs. They say it's new, and I trust them, but I'm really, really scared because I don't know if craigslist is trustworthy about that type of thing. They promised me they would put a mattress protector on it before they put it with everything else, but the mattress protector didn't fit, so they just put it in without it. I brought my fear of bed bugs up repeatedly throughout the month and they just kept calling me sensitive. But, once I realized they put it in without the mattress protector, I freaked out and broke down crying multiple times. I asked them to take the mattress back so I could sleep on the floor instead. They got mad at me and started to call me things like mentally ill, and I went to my room. This kind of hurt because I just recently talked to them about my anxiety and how I feel like I can't live life like a normal person because I'm so scared all of the time. And, they don't really believe in therapy. Then, they started talking about me in the hallway even though they know I can hear them, and my brother came upstairs and told them to tell me to go fuck myself because I walk all over them all the time. I think he also said ""ew"" or ""eugh"" when he saw me crying earlier. I don't know how to feel about this because it's the first time I've heard him talk in a while, and I hoped maybe he was nicer now, but I guess that answers my question. They then brought me to look at the mattress and confirm it was ok, but it didn't really make my fear better. I saw some black stuff on the side (looked like chipped black paint), but it didn't look like the pictures of bed bug droppings online, so I think it looked okay. I know you can't really tell just by looking unless you flip it over and check every crevice. I just said it was ok because they were mad at me and saying I was making drama. But, I'm so scared of it still. I think I'll just sleep on the floor, but I'm scared to have the mattress in my room, and it's packed with all of my stuff, so if the mattress is infested, so is everything else now. I wish I had a family that would tell me they love me and say it's okay instead of complaining about what a nuisance I am. Or let me buy my own mattress; I would have been so happy. I think they bought it without talking to me about it cause they knew I would say no. I can't afford to have bedbugs, and I'm terrified of them. I'm not at risk or anything (I'm happy to be moving out soon), so don't worry about me, but sometimes when things like these happen I wish I just didn't exist because I feel so useless and unlovable. It's funny because it's such a minor problem. I guess I am really crazy"
Anxiety,Do seasons affect your anxiety?,"In the summer I feel more exposed and I want to hide away, but once autumn and winter arrives I’m more confident and productive. It’s like a vicious cycle."

Anxiety,I get so much anxiety from being left on opened/read.,"I try to convince myself the opposite of what my anxiety is telling me. It’s too strong. I keep going back and forth from positive and negative thinking. It’s so tiring. I don’t like this at all.

I just want reassurance without having to ask for it."
Anxiety,Levels of anxiety and knowing if or when you have it?,"Sorry the title maybe a little confusing. 
Just wanting to know other people’s experiences. 
I think I have anxiety. I haven’t been diagnosed but the thing is, it’s not cause I don’t want to be... it’s because my brain kinda talks me out of it. So hard to type this out cause I sound like an actual crazy person. 
So lately I feel like I’ve been noticing long time issues I’ve always had becoming worse. Example: I get anxiety talking to people face to face, I’d much rather message or text. I feel like I explain myself better and can actually get what I’m thinking and feeling out properly. If I get into an argument or some sort of conflict face to face, I get all nervous and I end up slurring my words and then I end up getting angrier. When the argument or whatever it was is over, I sit and think about all the shit I should of said instead. 

Now this happens quite a lot. I’ve always had it too. Just lately it’s gotten worse. I know I should go see a doctor or whatever but I literally talk myself out of it. I start thinking I’m not that bad and there’s people out there that have it worse than me. I’m an idiot. I don’t need to go. I also think of all the people who will find out and how different they will treat me. Maybe they might think I’m attention seeking or maybe I’m lying cause my symptoms aren’t bad. 

I just need some guidance on if anyone else has had similar and how you’ve convinced yourself to go."
Anxiety,"Last week I posted that it was hell for me driving again, and how anxiety is ruining my chances of passing my exam.","Well today, anxiety can eat it.

I passed my driving exam, and I'm couldn't be happier :)"
Anxiety,I’m (possibly irrationally) afraid that my fiancé is going to die...,"So I’ve been with my fiancé for a couple years and he is genuinely the most pure and caring person I’ve ever met. My brain keeps trying to convince me that my situation is “too good to be true” and somehow, some way, the rug will get pulled out from under me eventually. I’ve coped well with my anxiety so far in our relationship, but recently it has gotten worse. My fear mostly revolves around the idea that he will get in a car accident. I’m going to try to explain what’s going on without making this too long so bare with me lol 

We currently live in Georgia in a mid sized town. He drives and I don’t because I’m low vision and my family has a horrible history of car accidents, specifically on “back roads” so driving in general is terrifying to me. Right now, he drives through town to get to and from work every day, which bothers me, but not to a crippling extent. We started looking for a house last year and either couldn’t find anything or couldn’t afford a down payment until we found something out of town that qualified for a 0% down USDA loan. No money down on a beautiful AND affordable house at
2.5% interest probably seems like a dream to most people, but it’s becoming a nightmare for me and it’s getting very real because we qualified for the mortgage and the seller wants to close by the end of September. 

The house is about 5-6 miles outside of the city limits of our current location. It’s on a two lane road and it passes through an intersection that has had some bad accidents in the past. The intersection is a 4 way, but only one of the roads has stop signs on each side. People have been known to blow through them or people coming down the main road ignore the flashing lights and don’t slow down, which has led to them slamming the breaks because someone didn’t see them coming and they went ahead and pulled through. Couple that with the fact that my immediate family has 3 incidents of horrific and fatal car accidents and I get sick just thinking about him going to work. 

I don’t really have any friends since I can’t drive and I don’t work because I don’t have any way to get to a job. Our town isn’t a place with public transportation and I will be even farther from everything when we move. I’m okay with starting a home business, but I am lonely. My fiancé is the only person I really have and it’s nearly impossible to make new connections around here, especially when you don’t interact with other people on a regular basis. I’m absolutely terrified that he’s going to get in an accident on his way to work and I’m going to be left alone with no friends or support system, stuck in the country with now way to even get groceries or necessities. 

The rent in the part of town we are in is unsustainable and the house is a good investment so the logical part of me knows that moving is the best thing. The logical part of me is aware that thousands of people pass through that intersection to get to work from the surrounding small towns weekly and they do this for their entire career with no problems and they never think twice about it. But there’s another side of me that knows my mom’s sister smashed into a tree and was crushed. The other half of me knows that my grandfather hit the back of a semi that took the top of his car off. My mom and grandmother both woke up with their sister and husband in the morning, and their life was permanently changed by the end of the day and I can’t escape the thought of that happening to me as well. Accidents happen on these country roads every year and I almost have myself convinced that we’re next. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t NOT worry about it, but I also know I can’t live like this. This house is an incredible opportunity and we could potentially sell it later for a profit and go anywhere we want. I really want to be able to move and just be normal and not spend every day waiting in a panic for him to call me and tell me he made it to work. It’s to the point where I’m thinking of telling him that we need to back out of the sale, but I know we won’t find anything else like what we got and staying where we are will hold us back. I don’t want to be alone in a town that is basically a 4-way intersection, blind, with no friends and no way out. The closer we get to closing, the worse my fear gets and I’m afraid that every day we live there is going to be total misery.


I’m not sure what to do and I’m just trying to get this out of my head. I’ve told my fiancé about my fear and he tells me he understand my hesitation, but not to worry about it because he’s a safe driver. I’ve tried to explain that it’s not him, it’s other people I’m worried about but I feel like nobody will ever get where I’m coming from. I just don’t want to feel crazy and I want to be happy about buying our first house and starting a new life. I’m miserable when I shouldn’t be and I feel like I’m failing the only person I have."
Anxiety,anxious for no reason,"title says it all. im often anxious for no good reason. well, at least thats how i would describe it. i always feel as if my heart was beating stronger and faster than normal, and its a really unpleasant feeling. i can sometimes even hear it beating. 

never went to a therapist to deal with this, and i dont know how to cope with it, since every ""help"" page suggests things like ""be positive!"" or ""try not to overthink too much"", and they are not really helpful to me, since i dont find a reason to be anxious, im just. 

i dont really feel this as a threat to my life, since i once told my mum about this and she told me she feels the exact same thing as me, so i thought i just had bad luck with the genetics and had to get used to it. but recently, i went out for a walk after a long time of being in lockdown (4 months) and i began getting really really anxious and had a really hard time with breathing. 

so, do any of you feel the same thing as i? is there any way i can deal with this? how do i stop being anxious most of the day? and if i cant stop it, is there any way to at least making living with it easier and stop wasting all of my days doing nothing?"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious during slow times with not much to do?,"I’ve been on summer vacation for the last week, but because of the pandemic most of my plans have been canceled.  During the same time, my anxiety has gotten really bad.  I notice that I start feeling bad when I have a lot of free time but not much of a plan.  Of course, there is also the fact that my job has really slowed down because of everything, and I feel like I need a change.  Does anyone else feel they are at their worst with a lack of goals and things to do, rather than too much stress?"
Anxiety,Anxiety just woke me up,"I'm trying to control it and keep it down, it's 5 AM here and I just went to sleep one hour ago, think I had a nightmare (it's the fourth time this week) and my heart is having a nervous party and I couldn't breathe.

I have my weekly session of therapy in a few hours so I'm glad I get to talk about this soon.

Hope you're doing better than me right now, I'll be okay in a few minutes probably!

Also I have a specific brand of mint flavoured candy that I *need* when having anxiety, I have it right alongside my bed, it's like my cigarette, but candy. Does anyone else have something like this?

Anxiety,Money problems,"My brother has a small firm for construction and my father and a couple others work for him. Brother met a dude that had connections to people that run hotels and stuff like that. The man hired my brothers firm, everything went well, we could pay our bills and even saved up a bit to fix our stairs. But then the coronavirus started. My brother and dad couldn't come back from abroad since if they left, they couldnt be able to come back to work. They had been there for a month and then stayed an extra 2. Brother and dad were becoming pretty sad because they couldnt have any real time off, working 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. The 2 of them decided to fly back home and the other 2 stayed. My brother, dad and the 2 others were the only ones that werent afraid to work on the roof of the hotels/any other buildings, they got praised that they had the balls to do it and that no one else would go for it. The man that hired my brothers firm hadnt complained until my family got home. He said that my brothers workers were being lazy and werent doing much progress. (The workers told my brother that they were doing what they were told, finished the job and then waited for more work so it seemed like they didnt do much, idk how much of that is true tho) Long story short, the man that hired my brothers firm didnt pay my brother for a few days of work, but bro had to pay his workers, my brother said he didnt have enough money to pay them and tried talking to them that he will pay them later etc etc. They quit and basically sued my brother. Since they couldn't sue my brother for the 'stolen money' (They had to sue brothers boss for it) they sued for missed allowance. Brother was never given the money for allowance, only for the work from his boss. If my brother had paid them the allowance it would've been out of pocket and he would've gone broke by the end of the month. This whole thing is so messed up, the 4 of them lived together, my brother fed them and gave them a place to stay and they now are suing him. My brother and dad are working in our home country in small construction sites which will not be enough to cover the nearly 2k euros. So my brother wont have money and my dad wont have money which means my mom and I also wont have money. We have some money for food, but idk about the bills. My mom and dad are now argueing over the phone and my brother is just very stressed. It's been a few years since my brother is trying to get back on his feet with his firm, he was almost there but then he got sued. Fuck this shit"
Anxiety,Would it weird if I try to keep the conversation going with this girl i really like?,"So i started speaking to this girl in school as friends not really outside of school. But she tweeted something and i replied with a joke and we started talking more. But i always feel like I’m annoying to her, I have learned that this could be my anxiety so i get through it and talk to her. We have a really active conversation but after a couple hours she would reply with “hmmm” “😂😂” and either she doesnt know what to say or shes tired of the convo. I really want to carry on the convo but it also maybe that im forcing it so i just leave it. I know what to talk about but i dont know whether i seem clingy."
Anxiety,roadblock,So I'm in my 20's and have never gotten my driver's license. I drove a little bit as a kid (we lived on a farm) but there was a 10 year gap between then and when I got back behind the wheel of a car again as a learner and my anxiety had well and truly gotten a grip on me by then; I went on one drive around the block and haven't gotten behind the wheel ever again. I find myself having dreams where I keep crashing the car into other cars and keep thinking I'm going to mess up behind the wheel and end up killing someone and I feel myself physically and mentally freeze up. I've been able to manage without a license (sort of) but I want to start being properly independent so I can stop using my friends and Ubers for lifts everywhere. Does anyone else get weird about driving/has anyone else dealt with this and overcome it? I'm booking in lessons with a driving instructor and telling them from the outset about this mental block but any other advice/encouragement in general would be great. I'll give anyone who helps me a ride whenever they need it.
Anxiety,Anyone else wake up vomitting from anxiety?,"Hey all!

I have had this problem since I was a teenager where most mornings I will wake up gagging and vomitting. I had a severe episode a few years ago where I was vomitting everyday for a month and having horrible panic attacks to the point where I went to the hospital. They did blood tests and as they showed nothing it was put down to stress. Now, the vomitting and nausea is back and I have no clue how I am going to survive like this for much longer as this constant feeling of sickness is horrible.

Anyone else have similar experiences and how do you deal with this nausea and vomitting, especially as a working adult?"

Anxiety,need some advice and tips?,can any one recommend some tips to develop larger attention span and focus speacial during anxious days
Anxiety,"I try to fall asleep, get the ""fall of a cliff/misstep"" dream, jump awake. Rinse and repeat until I'm afraid to sleep. Great.","It's something new I've been getting. I read once that this phenomenon is due to your heart rate slowing down too much too fast and your body thinks it's dying so it shocks itself awake. 

So it does make sense - I only have it when I go to bed anxious. My heart rate IS elevated, but I'm also very tired so I can somehow fall asleep. Doze off and BOOM, I'm upright and gasping for air within a minute since I deeamt I died. This makes my heart pound even more, causing it to happen again a few minutes later.

Leaving me in an endless cycle where I'm too physically tired to fight off sleep, but I'm terrified of sleep, which causes it to happen, and I end up getting 2-3hrs of anxiety riddled sleep and I wake up feeling like I was hit by a truck.

Please, body, sleep is my only escape sometimes. Can't you let me have this??"

I was starting to freak out and decided to get out of my room and is in the living room right now. My hands are kind of shaky and I don’t think I will be able to make up for the sleep I missed tonight. My room has been big central ever since moving into my new house. Ever since June  have I been getting spiders, silverfish, and recently a freakin’ centipede! I have the biggest closet in the house so I think that’s why my room in particular is getting the most bugs. And pests like beetles and silverfish attract even scarier spiders and centipedes. I keep the door closed but it’s still elevated at the top. And I feel bad for when they have to be killed because I know they are just trying to survive and aren’t really harmful, but they are so scary! And can’t sleep knowing one of these arthropods can crawl on me with their multiple legs at night while I’m awake since my sleep is delayed so I’m up all night. Fuck I wanna go back to my old house we only little beetles and spiders not shit like this!"
Anxiety,This was really difficult to make.,"Recorded  this morning, after an anxiety attack.  Its my first youtube video. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpGjXWRwKd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpGjXWRwKd8)"
Anxiety,I’m starting a new job today and I’m so anxious and sad,"I wish we could go back to the beginning of quarantine. I got to be home all day every day with my dog and my husband. Sure I’d lost my job, but we were doing okay with unemployment, and my husband had had a big promotion. It was honestly heaven.

Now it’s back to real life. I have to go talk to people and be at an office all day. I just finished my comm degree with honors and I’m still going to be working what is essentially a paid internship because no where else will call me back. This life is such a drag."
Anxiety,I've never felt so hopeless in my life.,This Coronavirus situation is never going to end. No good news is happening with it. It's all awful. It just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. I have no desire to be alive or do things in my life anymore. I will not harm myself but life is so awful and I hate it.
Anxiety,i don’t know why,whenever i look at my ceiling for too long i either get very uncomfortable or have a panic attack it’s something about the texture of it
Anxiety,I'm done with life,I'm done with this life. I'm 25 and have been suffering from anxiety and OCD attacks for 7 years now. My energy and spirit has been sapped and there's nothing I wish to do more than go into a state of deep sleep forever. I love my father so much but the pain is starting to exceed that love. I'm a broken man and I want to go.
Anxiety,Do you just have anxious days?,"Do you sometimes have days where you just wake up anxious and it's not one particular thought but just an anxious day? Almost anything can trigger it more?

Sometimes music helps me temporarily but it gets bad again.

Is that normal or something else is going on? Any tips or advise?"
Anxiety,The root of all my anxiety seems to lead me back to social phobia,"I have traced much of my anxiety back to a fear of social repercussions and how people will think of me or treat me if something happens.

For example, my health anxiety is not about the fear of death or getting a disease. It’s having to go for treatments and interact with the doctors. It’s having to lose my job and people will treat me bad or think bad of me or I will have to be the center of attention, which I hate.

My fear of bad thoughts/harm thoughts that have gotten intrusive is not an actual fear of the thoughts. I really don’t care about them per say, but I fear what they mean about me and how people in society would view me if they found out. I fear losing my mind and facing public ridicule. 

These things are social fears. I can see that the root of my anxieties tend toward a social phobia. 

So how does one conquer that? Can I honestly just say screw everyone I don’t care what they think of me? I wish I could. That only works for a minute and I’m right back where I started. Anyone get treatment for a social phobia? How did it help and what was it like?"
Anxiety,Caught in a news anxiety loop,"I know this has been a reoccurring post but I wanted to get this out of my chest. 

I am falling into a rabbit hole of bad news and their consequences applying to myself and my family, my loved ones. I watch a headline, e.g. for the pandemic or a military minor incident and understand they're being distorted and sprinkled with BS. 

Then I think it over and try to find the same news in another news website. Then another and another, until I find something that calms myself. If I don't (that's the case most of the times) I feel so scared and I find myself pushing my hands to the chair, gritting my teeth and quickly breathing. 

I have the power to end my curiosity and turn my eyes away from the news. And then I find myself  thinking scenarios about what may happen in a case that is much worse from reading an event's or incident's progress. 

I am caught in a loop and don't know what to do. Maybe some exercises to calm down? Are you going through a similar situation?"
Anxiety,I have anxiety over whether I love something or not. I'm doubting my true feeling,"I dont know if anyone has ever experienced the same thing as me and I really hope someone could sympathize with these feelings.

  
Long story short, the lastest relationship I had really planted a seed of self-doubt in me. My ex really liked me, however, my feeling for him depleted after the rush has run out. This lead to me forcing myself to reciprocate his feeling to the point where I felt so suffocated by his love. Everytime I looked at him, I had the same question: ""Do I love this person"" and persuaded myself that the answer is yes but deep down I was so exhausted and mentally-drained by this relationship. 

Come back to now, I find myself struggling when it comes to meeting new potential partner as the seed of self-doubt never leaves, it keeps coming back once in a while and sprouting in my head when I'm alone. I have a an illusion that maybe all my feeling for them now is all fake and fabricated, that I am forcing myself to do so.  


I feel so helpless."
Anxiety,They say to overcome anxiety you need to challenge it but sometimes I’m tired and just want to play video games but then I get anxious about not challenging myself.,"Does anyone else get this?

Does anyone have any books/tv programs/YouTube videos I can show them to make them understand and help me better? TIA"
Anxiety,When going back to school in September there is a girl that triggers my anxiety and depression,"I am a 13F. The girl that triggers me is 11F. She is my sisters best friend. This year my sister and her best friend are moving up to secondary school and unfortunately my sisters best friend got into the school that I got to.

A couple of things to note is that she is tiny (in terms of height) and I'm fairly tall. She is very sweet to some people but a complete monster to others. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts depression self harm anxiety and depression since I was 7 (ish). She is also very bright (so am I so we are kind of equal in that department). I'm also a black belt in taekwondo.

The problems started in primary school. She started picking on another little girl (me and my sis have known her most of our lives and she is like a sister) who has autism. She also kept nagging me and my friends and bothering us for fun. Now I know this is normal kids stuff but it escalated. She would hurt my friends if I defended the other girl who is like a sister. She told me to kill myself and that if I was her sister she would wish I was dead. She also paid people to try and beat me up (they failed) and hit me with a wooden brick. Apparently I was too ""aggressive"" when I removed her from me while she was hitting me and removed her from the friends she was hitting and stuff. When she would grab me I wouldn't do any locks or anything I'd just pull my hand of whatever she had grabbed out of her grip. Just to note I have never hurt her but she has almost dislocated my knee before. But what really hurt was her telling me to go kill myself and my sis never did anything about it. The thing was she just reinforced everything I felt about myself. She told me to kill myself a couple of times a week. Once my mum found out about it I was moving to secondary school so there wasn't an issue. But everytime i see her i hear her voice in my head telling me to kill myself. And I end up cutting. What should I do when I go back to school? What can the school do about it? I live in the UK if that is relevant"
Anxiety,I’m at a loose end and being unproductive and have no motivation but it’s ultimately causing me guilt and anxiety. How do I break the cycle?,"I suffer from anxiety and social anxiety and lately things have been tough. I am not in school for another month but I’m still expected to take care of my own education till then. My parents are at work most days so I’m home alone all day most days. I don’t have many close friends and never meet anyone aside from my boyfriend. He’s like my best friend and while we do have other friends, we never meet with them and only with each other. We make each other very happy but I am aware our dependancy on each other is unhealthy and we should spend more time with other people too. The thing is my “friends” aren’t very close to me. We only communicate at school and through a group chat but they’re not the sort of people I would be comfortable sharing my problems with. At the moment I’m only leaving the house mac once a week and I’m not getting much in the way of social stimulation. I am an introvert, but still need social interactions to keep myself happy. I spend my days feeling at a loose end. I try to do anything productive, studying, drawing, cleaning, but nothing makes me happy and I feel unmotivated and insecure. Insecure at my social anxiety, some days the thought of leaving the house is unbearable but I know I have to to perk myself up. For some reason I still stay in, moping in bed all day even when I know it’s making me miserable and I just wish I could get out of this self destructive, unmotivated cycle. I am not diagnosed with depression but I fear it’s coming to that as this has been ongoing for at least 2 months. The group chat with my mates has also become dead in the past month. No one ever talks to each other anymore unless there is a reason. The only people I hang out with are my parents and boyfriend and I really wish I could fee happy and get my motivation up so I can study. I feel so anxious of my future and guilty for not studying as my career path is a tricky one and I’m already having to work twice as hard as others just to prove I’m worthy of doing it. I’m either feeling anxious or low and unmotivated or some days both. I only got 4 hours sleep last night due to the guilt and anxiety. Any advice on how to get out of this cycle? I understand it’s a deeper routed mental illness but is there any personal things I could try and do to help?"

Anxiety,Advice,"Hi, am pretty new to reddit. 
I know my symptoms are mild in comparison to some of you suffering on here. Was just hoping someone may be able to offer some advice. 

I’m 18, Male, from London. Never really suffered with anxiety or been particularly depressed for a long period of time. Generally quite a happy person. 

However, in the last 3 or 4 months (since Corona virus and the Lockdown really) I’ve started feeling more anxious and unable to completely relax and switch off. I grind my teeth a lot, can’t seem to get good quality sleep or more than 7 hours and recently have been feeling quite ill (not corona virus😂) waking up in the middle of the night pale and sweating, and sometimes feeling sick and having a dodgy stomach. 

Just was wondering if anyone can recommend any techniques and practises to help alleviate the symptoms and make myself feel a bit better. 

Thanks to all! ❤️"
Anxiety,Finally I went to barbershop to cut my hair since Covid-19 hit!,"Around 7 months ago already since my last haircut before this one. Even in normal situation, I am always anxious to go to salon or barbershop to cut my hair, because of their chatters and strong smells.


Now amidst of Covid-19, I was afraid to get sudden anxious symptoms because for sure they need to take off my mask sides to shave my beards (means more interactions with them) and since this barbershop was not the usual shop I go, so I need to re-explain the styles I want.


Eventually, everything WENT VERY WELL!


Few advices from me, fight for your anxiety! Never let it to make you not brave to face world. Go out from comfort zone! I know it is very hard, because I waited for 1 month++ to finally brave enough. When you finally overcome your anxiety, you will get very satisfied and happy, it is like you 1 level up from your old being.


Hope this post going to help someone else out there 🙂"
Anxiety,What is this???,"

Scared because Of his feeling. I slept last night and kept waking up throughout the night. But thing is the feelings I was feeling. I felt oddly shaky and nervous but tired at the same time. My body felt fuzzy and I was sensitive to everything. Not to get this confused with anxiety. It’s like that feeling you have when low blood sugar hits but without the excessive fatigue. It’s like with the adrenaline rush and shaky nervousness feeling. I had it ALL night. Woke up throughout the night and felt it. Went back to sleep and then again. I didn’t get a good wink of sleep because I felt this way. Kinda like a restless nervous shaky fuzzy feeling in my body and head. It was the worst I can’t shake it off. Anyone had this? Don’t get mixed with anxiety because it’s not my usual anxiety episodes. Last night I had some brief periods of adrenaline thrown at me during sleep. I’d jump and wake up just before going to sleep. I’d feel it in different places of my body. It was the weirdest feeling and still feeling the effects now as I get up. Does anyone understand?!"

Anxiety,Anxiety Over a Good Job?,"I have had a string of terrible jobs. I come from a rural area, was the first in my family to graduate from college, and then I had to move to a city to get a job.

Anxiety,Having one of those severe life threatening attacks,"I lost my dad recently and since then my mind has been creating all the negative situations I could be in henceforth. 
Right from 'what if I lose my mother too' to 'what if someone kills me and my mother'. 
I have absolutely no control over my mind and body right now. Like I just want to have tonnes of sleeping pills so that I don't wake up to reality. I have zero strength left to fight my negative emotions. I don't know if I would survive this phase or would be dead before it ends but I can't help myself right now. Nothing is working out. I'm having sleepless nights, continuous headaches. I'm literally trembling out of fear. I don't know what future holds for me but before anything happens, my own fucking mind will kill me.

Anxiety,The one thing that helped my decade of anxiety,"....is playing candy crush. 

This sounds SO weird when you hear it, but i've suffered anxiety and panic attacks in which i feel very sick, hot and dizzy for about two minutes, /so for around six months i've been using candy crush (occasionally even animal crossing) to stave off panic. it works EVERY time! no matter what, if i feel an inkling of panic coming on I just whack that bad boy up and start playing. 
It's very slow paced, there's no time limit and there's even quite soothing music. 

hope this can help somebody suffering like I did."
Anxiety,I don’t know if this was a panic attack?,I was having a test. In tests I get super nervous and start thinking about how everyone’s doing so much better and how I’m stupid and maybe even how I should kill my self but anyway this time I was calm as I’ve lowered my expectations of myself and repeat my mantra I am more than a grade. Test is going great one question I’m stuck on a question mini stress tell myself go move on it’s only worth one mark. Everything else goes great come back to question fiddle around and then I finally got it. Then check back through the rest of my work and teacher says times almost up and for some reason I can’t even describe this I couldn’t understand anything on the page anymore I was so alert (like when your terrified) I was mentally like frazzled but my body was physically scared. This has only happened once before. You get so confused you can’t even understand anything or think about were you are to calm yourself down. It’s only afterwards you realise at the moment you weren’t okay. My legs were shaking afterwards and I still felt on edge for 2 hours after oh my gosh.
Anxiety,"Advice on how to calm a racing, anxious mind?","I feel an attack coming, but grounding and breathing doesn't seem to help me.

Anxiety,New Anxiety Symptom - Question,"I've been doing very good with my anxiety lately, but last night I got a panic attack again after my aprtment building had small fire and that scared me a lot.

So, I got this weird new anxiety symptom - I woke up to a panic attack and my tongue was feeling ""weird"", like, I couldn't relax it and kept smacking/pushing it to the roof of my mouth. My mouth was also very dry. My tongue also felt like ""too big"" and I couldn't stop thinking about my tongue and like, ""where to place it"". I have pretty bad health anxiety, so this worried me a lot waking up to it at night. 

Is this a common symptom of anxiety? Has anyone else experienced this? This was a new one for me, so it worries me a bit."

Anxiety,Is this anxiety? Or something serious?,"I've been having this breathing problem for a long time now, where my body isn't automatically breathing on its own. All-day I constantly have to inhale and exhale all on my own if I don't I just don't breathe at all. Sorry if I didn't explain that correctly, it's kind of hard to explain but I have been dealing with this for as long as I can remember and it's just annoying.

My neck feels tight a lot too, when I try to eat or drink, it feels like I'm about to choke or I just get this choking sensation. 

I remember a time where I could just do whatever I wanted without having that, of course, I was obviously still breathing normally, just not like the way I am now. I hope that all made sense?

Anxiety,Too much anxiety to function,"Hello from Chicago-

I love this city but am so scared for it after what happened overnight. I am so sad seeing what is happening to such a wonderful place I grew up going to (from its suburbs) and have proudly lived in.

I am supposed to be getting married in July 2021. I am so nervous now. Dr. Fauci and my dad (lol) are both doctors who never sugarcoat things medically, and they've both been optimistic about a vaccine by the end of the year. My worry is distribution, though my parents are both healthy but at an age where maybe they'd be prioritized? I am just so scared about all of this, and the Coronavirus subreddit is not helping my anxiety.

And I've been looking for a teaching position and can't find jack shit in a crowded market, so I have to curb my intrusive thoughts that, by looking in other industries for now, I am a failure.

If you know of any way to settle my nerves, please holler. BTW I am talking to my therapist on the phone this week, and my fiance has finally agreed to sit in on a call. I am nervous for that! He and I get along great, but he's had a hard life growing up and has his own anxieties (though he's more even-keel than me), so I think talking to her would be nice for him."

Anxiety,Steps to Curb Morning Anxiety,"Hey everyone! I want to use this post as a resource for people to help their morning anxiety, and ask some questions so my day-to-day is a bit easier.

I'm a college student. For reasons extending past COVID I've developed numerous symptoms of anxiety for over 3 months now. In the morning, waking up is dreadful and I'm stressed and nauseous. As the day goes on, I feel better mentally, but I spent the first half of the day with minimal food / drink so it transitions into fatigue / tiredness.

**Here are some steps I've taken to help:**

\- CBD pills (probably a combination of placebo and positive impacts - this takes the edge off)

\- Stay moving - take walks if you're worried about your heart-rate (I went through a period where I thought my heart was going to fail). The higher the intensity of the workout, the better you'll feel - just don't overdo it!

\- Express your challenges verbally to friends or family. When people in my life knew I was going through issues, I felt more reassured they'd support me if I needed it.

\- Basic stuff we've all read like a healthy amount of sleep, screen time, good diet, mindfulness.

I hope if you're having similar issues, one of the above tips helps you out.

**What else can I be doing?**

Next week I start my dream internship at a company I've been following for years. The workplace is extremely fast-paced and high-stakes. I wouldn't normally have an issue with this, and it's something I sought out previous to my anxiety lately. Since this issue has been stagnant for a while now, I went to the doctor and now have a prescription for Lexapro (10mg). I haven't noticed any differences yet, but I was told it can take up to a month.

I'm worried I'll be too stressed to function at my internship next week. By then, I don't think the Lexapro will have kicked in. I'm taking it one day at a time at my current, relatively stress-free job. It's tough imagining a situation where I'm completely unaffected next week.

What are some solutions I could try to make sure I handle the start of the job correctly?"
Anxiety,Anxiety under control for the most part except when I am dreaming,"Hi everyone, 

I had been diagnosed with anxiety last year and had been on medication for about 7 months till I made some lifestyle changes that allowed me to come off the meds (with the doctor supervising ofcourse )

I had to quit my job (which was the main reason for my anxiety because of a toxic , abusive environment) stopped smoking and also started going to the gym regularly and it has been fine so far EXCEPT for when i’m dreaming. 

My nightmares leave me paralysed , breathless and crying till i pass out (maybe cause of less oxygen because i can’t breathe ? ) ....are never about monsters or scary things but it’s always related to my romantic life. 

anytime i dream of an ex i always wake up having the most horrible panic attacks, which take me about an hour to come out of. and it ruins my day. and i can’t control it. i’m off meds and i don’t think i should start medicating again because of a dream because dreams, like panic attacks, come uninvited, when you least expect them.

i’ve always been a good sleeper but whenever i have these panic-attack-lost-love-dreams i find it difficult to sleep for the next 3-4 days .i’ll do anything to keep myself awake. 

i have scary dreams too but they are fine, they are like every other dream but it’s always the dreams about love that leave me shaken up. 

they leave me feeling so empty and numb afterwards that i often think about ending my life. but it’s not a permanent feeling, it’s only for as long as the dream is fresh. i feel like i left my reality behind when i woke up and my current state, is a dream and i’m trapped in it and i have to go back (to the dream and to my imaginary husband, kids and my home) and the only way i think i can go back is if i kill myself. 

do you think i should go back to the doctor ? because it’s not a daily occurrence."
Anxiety,Feeling bad about my first driving lesson,I've just had my first driving lesson and I feel it didn't go very well. My legs kept shaking and I couldn't properly control the gas pedal.

Anxiety,Got a panic attack at the doctors office but at least I got my referral to a psychologist!,"As the title says, I went to the doctor for general sickness and while in the waiting room I got a panic attack. Of course I was up next so I was still pretty much crying and hyperventilating when I was called in. I told my doctor that I am panicking but that I am here for unrelated reasons. He immediately understood and after treating me I told him that I have an appointment with a psychologist and without hesitation he wrote me a referral so I can get some money back through insurance.

I thought I was dying during the attack, but I probably would have forgotton about the referral if it wasn't for me panicking.

Still a 0/10 - I don't recommend panicking at the doctors office."

Anxiety,Can't stop worrying about my cat,"My cat is currently confined in an animal hospital because he won't eat and is really sick. I was fine before thinking he is in the best care of vet doctors.

Anxiety,Anxiety disorder?,"Hi all,

I am kind of new to this.

I have been struggling with a huge burnout since August last year. I had huge panic attacks and sadness all day long. After being in Lexapro since September things are getting better and since 4 weeks I am totally off from lexapro 20mg.

However I recon that when i:

- drink more than 3 beers, the next 3 days I am kind of anxious, panicking about nothing. Just the strange feeling

- dont get my 8 hours of sleep same symptoms

- drink more than 2 cups of coffee, same symptoms

- skip running outside for 3 days, same symptoms

Could someone tell me if this is still from my burn out? Or is it anxiety disorder? Or withdrawal from Lexapro? 

I appreciate your time and consideration of replying to me, 
Greetings from Holland"
Anxiety,Friend’s anxiety becoming too much to handle,"My first post in this sub. 

I have a dear friend with whom I get along super well, our children are also very close. We don’t live in the same country so we meet for long weekends or vacations. 

I’m a huge extrovert, I speak several languages, have always traveled a lot. 

My friend only speaks our native language which is a huge hinderance of course; and she said because of a 15yo relationship trauma she developed phobia and anxiety about traveling (trains or planes).

We’ve been been spending holidays together over the last 5 years or so. She ended up taking a train abroad with us and they were meant to fly to our country for holidays this summer but she got ill so it got canceled. 

My problem is that although she thinks every year she’s improving, and that I’m a huge inspiration and change maker, I just think it’s getting a huge burden for me. 

I feel like for a one week vacation I’m “paying” months of emotional labor as she’s leaning on me to deal with her anxieties. I know that I am no longer willing to take this burden on. 

I have other things in life where I need to focus my energy. I have forgot from one vacation to the next how hard it is to move anything along. I remember last year she agonized so much over everything that I ended overpaying for all my plans because I had run out of options. Every time she lets it linger that she might not manage to take the trip (or that I should find out if there are other people who might be willing to take over her tickets in case she cannot manage to which I said that’s certainly crossing a line and it would be the end of me ever planning anything with her)

It would help me to be able to say: “dear friend, I know you feel you have come a long way and we already discussed that we have very different experiences and I cannot really understand what you’re going through with your anxiety. But for me this is extremely exhausting and I have come to realize that I cannot offer you this kind of support, resulting in months of negative energy, for one week spent together. Can you please put in the effort of learning basic English so that you can travel self sufficiently and to manage your anxieties with professional help? If not, I won’t be organizing any more holidays together. With everyone else, I can agree on a time and place for joint holidays in two conversations and we meet when time has come. I would like to be able to do the same with you.”

I don’t know how she will receive it and I certainly don’t want to end this friendship but I feel I’m trapped and I cannot continue like this anymore. 

How can I deliver the message better? What kind of advice can I give her? What would you do?"
Anxiety,I wish I had a normal brain,I wish my brain didn't work to set me up for failure even before I do something. Why do I have to worry so much about things that haven't even happened? Why do I have to obsess so much about things in the future and my past? Why does it have to feel so hard to do simple things? Why do I feel so bad about taking so long to do things? I wish my brain was just normal so that I don't have to constantly work so hard to react to things in a way that doesn't hinder me so much.
Anxiety,online school,"I know it might seem like im overreacting, but my school forces us to turn cameras on during zoom meetings, im fine with PE though for some reason. But I just started online school today and i hate it. I got so conscious i was shaking and my heart was racing. I hate turning on a camera and showing myself, i also hate my voice sounds. Im very self conscious, and then my teacher told us we were going to do introductions, and that's when I left. I feel awful now, that i can't handle turning on my own camera or say a few words, I hate it. I ask my friend in the same class what I should do and she said to email her. But the thing is I dont know if she's understanding, since she's new. I also dont know if I Should go to my next class zoom meeting. Can anyone give me advice please?"
Anxiety,Daily survival tips,"Hi all,

I wanted some pinpoints for daily survival with anxiety. I have fully accepted that this is going to be with me for life (presumably). I took meds for a few years and I came off them 6 months ago. The last few weeks have been challenging since I’m back to working in an office. I’m fully accepting that I have to live with this and just want some pointers that may have helped you. I need to focus on what can help instead of a laundry list of things that can *possibly* be wrong with me. It’s exhausting. But I’m gonna fight the big fight. TIA."
Anxiety,My sister is the cause of my anxiety and I can't function properly with her around,"I'm afraid of my older sister and it's causing me terrible anxiety. 

My sister was a bully in my childhood. I may have been mentally weak from the start, but the things she made fun of me for has turned out into some form of trauma or phobia for me. I mean, I was watching that SpongeBob movie with David Hasselhoff when I was kid, and she makes fun of me for enjoying a film with David scantily clothed. I was 8. She did this well into my teenage years, and now I hate the image of a male's naked body, more so if it were toned. I'm not certain if that's where the disgust came from, but I'm sure it's contributed heavily to it. 

Around the age of 10, I developed a sort of fear from my sister being behind me, especially if we were in the kitchen and the knives were around. She would often poke me or do a maniacal laugh from behind and I'd always get the jumps. The fear has subsided a bit but it does creep into my thoughts on some days presently. 

I studied at a boarding school for all of my secondary education, and my sister was in college then. For the first summer, she acted like she was possessed, and that really freaked me out. For the rest of my summers, I dreaded being under the same roof as her, that she might actually turn out to be a demon. I know it sounds pathetic, but in the head of that 12 year-old, it never seemed irrational. I came to dislike the holidays and summers.

I'm in college now and I live with her. It was fine before the pandemic because I could go out and spend some time until the late evenings so I wouldn't have to talk to her too often but now I have nowhere to hide. She criticizes everything. The food I make, the clothes I wear, how I play my games, the questions I ask my doctor. It's not even constructive at all. It always feels condescending, even if she doesn't mean to be. She isn't inherently a bad person, but I can't see her for any of her good qualities because of how I feel like I've been mentally tormented throughout my life. And I'm ashamed of myself for turning my cheek to the good she does. 

We recently came into an argument about money, because she handles the household costs and she does it so badly. She's spending every extra coin and even the money that I needed for my eye medication. It got so bad that me and my mom have to keep extra money for my medication a secret from her in my account. My mom hasn't been able to stop sending her money for our other needs because she's the eldest, it might offend her that she doesn't get to hold the money anymore. I can see where my mom is coming from, because it can seem that nobody trusts my sister with the money and that would a really low blow for anyone really. 

Anyway, about the argument, I tell her that she doesn't keep tabs on our expenses and the lies she comes up with to justify the money we spent will never hold true with my tally and my other sister's tally. It becomes really heated and she tells me that I don't know fucking anything about the money. And this really hits me low. It reminds me of how insignificant I am in her eyes. That I have no say in how we spend the money whether it be for my meds or for food or for whatever. That I'm just younger and I shouldn't ever stand up to her again.

I haven't talked to her properly since and if she's around, my brain automatically goes into panic mode. I can't study if we're in the same space even if she's 10 feet away. I can't enjoy anything, I can't get my brain to calm down quickly because I'm afraid of being in her presence. Water gets hard to swallow. I don't know what I'm afraid of exactly anymore because I let her win that argument anyway by not saying anything, and just by accepting whatever she said about me. I just know I'm afraid of her and of what she can do to my mental health. I just want my brain to stop being so anxious all the time. It's disrupted my life so much. 

tl;dr: My sister has mentally tormented me for so long, and just after giving up my stance in a fight, I keep trying to fight a panic attack or avoid a situation being with her just in case a panic attack surfaces."
Anxiety,it's been a tough go for me lately at night and i decided to make a playlist to help me let the feelings out,i hope this can help someone else out too
Anxiety,Anyone else?,"So sometimes I have like depressed episodes or anxiety episodes and have some really bad anxiety attacks in between and I usually have a lot of thoughts pointing to anxiety, but if I ever have what I would call a ""good day"" I end up getting super anxious all over again because I get worried that I'm faking it or something. I was also wondering if it's normal to have some sort of sensory overload thing during the attacks like every sound, texture, light, and smell makes you upset or anxious?
 
I have not been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, not am I self diagnosing, and if I am, please let me know so I can change it!"
Anxiety,Exercising with anxiety - encouragement and suggestions!,"Does anyone else struggle with exercise due to elevated heart rate? I guess I just associate high heart rate with anxiety/panic, so in my mind, exercise gives me anxiety. I know there are long term benefits, and doctors are always encouraging me to exercise. I do take medication that keeps my heart rate and other physiological symptoms in check, yet I still worry.

I am horrible at yoga and get super discouraged when I try it, and it is way too hot where I am to walk outside. Does anyone have suggestions for exercise that you find is beneficial yet doesn’t get you too worked up?"
Anxiety,Guy hasn’t answered me after discussing my anxiety to him,"I don’t know what to do because in the past I’ve canceled plans and ghosted a guy bc my anxiety got the best of me and I couldn’t bring myself to go on a date w him. I decided to try again and I’ve been talking to this other guy, but I wanted to be clear that I have social anxiety and I can’t promise I won’t become distant and bail on our plans. He was really nice about it and asked how he could help and I thought it was going pretty good. But now he hasn’t answered my text in quite awhile and I’m worried I scared him away but telling him about my anxiety. I don’t wanna text him first because I’m scared he doesn’t like me and will be annoyed, but i just don’t know why he didn’t respond..."
Anxiety,Getting prescribed anti-anxiety medication to get through a rough time?,"I've been wrestling with anxiety on and off for a few years. I've been going to a therapist regularly since 2015. 
After hearing my girlfriend's mom say that her doctor prescribed her anti-anxiety medication to take ""as needed,"" I was hoping to get the same option. 
I talked to my doctor about it and he said ""It's not really prescribed like that,"" and pretty much shut me down. 
Well right now my girlfriend of about 6/7 years and I are breaking up. She is losing it, and I'm losing it. Nonstop crying and shaking and nausea. The lives we've built are being ripped apart and it seems impossible to get through this.  
I want some anti-anxiety medication to escape these feelings. I have no history with drug abuse, I don't have an addictive personality, and I've never taken recreational drugs or even drank alcohol for extended periods of time. 
I have Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance. Can I somehow go through telehealth to get to a doctor who will prescribe me some anti-anxiety meds? What can I do? Thanks."
Anxiety,So sick of this now,"I’ve had chest pains all day (which I of course assumed was a heart attack) and then decided to take a walk to try and ease the discomfort and general sense of unease. Ended up stumbling back home with jelly legs and now I’m just sat here feeling so drained and depressed.

I’ve struggled with anxiety for most of my life but it doesn’t seem to be getting better and more recently it’s so severe and chronic. I feel like my mind and body are disconnected. I don’t feel like me.

I don’t even really know if I want to be here anymore."
Anxiety,41 years old no career because of anxiety,This is my third episode. i'm 41 with my career in shambles. i live with my parents. i am feeling really stuck. do any of you feel like you are going to be disabled forever? or is it just me?
Anxiety,I gave in to anxiety just awhile ago... (But I also dont feel as guilty),"





So I have this problem where I am extremely shy when it comes to my digestive system and society - what if I'll have to use the bathroom? What if people will find out? What if an accident will happen? Etc etc.
So today I was on my way to my class, and I felt some movement in my stomach.
Now most of the times, and this comes from personal experience, nothing happens, but today I gave up to the anxiety.
Not that I think I felt overly anxious, I was having mized thoughts: on the one hand the usual thoughts that this is prob nothing, but on the other hand the thougjts that what if - what if an accident WILL happen this time?
So today I gave in.

And I didnt feel as bad tbh, idk why, I think perhapd I gave myself a pat on the back by saying ok.... You may have avoided the exposure this time, you gave in to anxiety this time, but overall, looking at the large picture, I am proceeding and progressing this year, and although I give in to anxiety and avoid exposure treatment and exposure situations from time to time, I still, overall, am dealing and trying most exposure situations (I think)
So overall this year I am mpving forward....

Also if I try to imagine what my psycbologist would have said right now if I approached her with my thoughts, I think she would say that ok, we try to expose ourselves as mich as possible, and even if avoiding the situation, such as today, isnt ideal, still it do no good to talk yourself down because of it, so proceed and look at the whole picture"
Anxiety,Just having a rough time of it,"Just a little venting is all. I've been stuck between high anxiety and low-grade panic for the last three or four days and its got me feeling very strained and weak. I know what I have to do in the upcoming week honestly shouldn't be that bad... but I'm just feeling so overwhelmed that its hard to really believe that. I'm hoping to truly give myself a day off from worry today and regenerate my energy so I can handle things well, but its not going great so far. I just wish there was someone in my life I trusted and could turn to for help. Unfortunately my therapist is really the only person on my side. 

I just wish I could up and run away from it all, you know? (No worries, I'm not suicidal.) I just don't know how much longer I can keep being ""strong"" (that is to say, struggling but keeping myself together well enough to function)."
Anxiety,My anxiety is ridiculous sometimes,"A few weeks ago I found a painful lump behind my ear. Of course my first impulse was to Google it, which sent my anxiety into a tailspin.  For 2 weeks I couldn't think about anything else and lost several nights of sleep over this lump.  Of course, I was also too afraid to make a doctor's appointment, because I was scared of what they might find.  I finally decided to get my act together and decided to make an appointment, which meant another 1.5 weeks of living in total panic.  When I got to my appointment this morning my HR was 102, when it's normally in the low 50's.  Now for the kicker: turns out I have a small infected cyst behind my ear lobe and just need a dose of antibiotics.  It's not the worst case news I have been bracing for thankfully.   

I am sharing this as a reminder that: A. It's ridiculous to avoid doctors because of fear of diagnoses (I am \*so\* guilty of this), and 2. 99.99% of the time things turn out for the best."
Anxiety,the morning comes so quick,
Anxiety,For the 3rd time my friend and I are arguing over the boundary I set.,"My friend, her family, and other friends are not taking covid as serious as Me and my family. I have worked really hard with accepting this. But I have told her multiple times that I still feel uncomfortable coming over to her home and she has gotten very upset every time.  The main reason I am uncomfortable is because she has a small child I do not want to get her sick. I have explained this multiple times. But she still gets upset. 

Yesterday I went to my inlaws. They had there more people over then what I was aware of when I agreed to go.  This included my husbands brother, his wife, and small child. I was not aware they would be there until they got there. But we chose to stay because its almost a two hour drive and we were still able to socially distance for the most part and i decided to use this opportunity to use the tools I have learned in therapy the week prior. While there my mother in law insisted on taking a photo with me and my sister in law. And like mt sister in lay walked in the room we posed for photo and kept on walking. There was know close contact besides this. And because I also struggle with social anxiety especially when it comes to my husbands family I didnt say no. Im still working on this setting boundaries thing. 

Before I even got home my friend messaged me about how hurt she is that I was okay with being there and hugging people (because of the one photo i took). I responded telling her I understand why she is upset and that i was sorry that it did. And that I would be okay with trying a socially distance hang out. 

She is not okay with a  social distance hang out. And once again threw in the photo thing. I understand completely where she is coming from but I feel as though she as completely thrown out where I have been mentally with all this. This was the biggest group of people I have beeb with since march and it was unplanned. I probably will have obsessive thoughts about it within the next week or two. Idk I am doing the best I can. I have had health anxiety even before this and a few weeks ago I was really really struggling and I told her this and she completely ignores that because she is upset for what ever reason because i cant really understand it. 

I feel like I am trying to explain why I was with another guy at a Party to my boyfriend who Is trying to accuse me of cheating when there was no cheating. And this is the 3rd time we have argued.about this. Im not changing how I am coping because sad. I cant for my own sanity. Which I told her. I am really afraid our friendship will end because of this."
Anxiety,Always worried about loved ones dying,"So I have this horrible habit if I haven’t heard from my sister or my mom for a day that the worst has happened. They both live in different parts of the country so I can only contact them via cell phone. I haven’t heard from my sister or her husband for a full day and I’m freaking out. I can’t get a hold of my mother either. My sister is notoriously bad with her phone, but I don’t remember ever not hearing from her for this long. I’m really concerned and I don’t know if I’m being ridiculous, but my mind always goes to the worst and I’m just so worried. Can anyone relate to this feeling? I just hate not being in contact with them. I just want my worry to go away. :("
Anxiety,"Does anyone else feel the need to stay constantly stimulated or they get bored easily, but get overwhelmed when they have too much to do?",Maybe it’s more of an ADD thing?
Anxiety,any advice managing anxiety at work and surrounding relationships?,"Posting something similar because no one responded when I posted this last night.  Does anyone have any advice with a) managing my anxiety surrounding relationships.  I want a relationship but I feel like I get anxious that the person doesent like me anymore all of the sudden, etc. I then get the urge to ""chase"" them/breeds insecurity and scare them off.

b) Work does NOT help my anxiety at all and hinders my performance.  I need to perform at work and anxiety just makes me.... bad.  If you have any advice for managing these things I welcome your feedback/ any personal experiences you have had.  Thank you!"
Anxiety,How can I help my BF (26M) with his social anxiety,"

Good morning Everyone :) 

So a little back story my boyfriend and I (25f) have been together for 8.5 years, started dating when we were teenagers. Over the last year his social anxiety has been noticeably worse when we’re around people we don’t see often. He becomes super “extra”. For example, very loud - sometimes obnoxious, all over the place - jumping from one idea to the next and getting into our guests belongings (he likes to be handy and do projects). And he declares harsh opinions about things that I know he doesn’t truly feel that way about, but it makes him look like an asshole (such as political things, social dynamics, etc.). When it’s the most severe it’s comparable to maniac behavior in Bipolar Disorder. He does have a history of ADHD and a lot of anxiety in his family history. 

I’ve tried talking to him about. He declines any feelings of social anxiety and basically tells me he was feeling perfectly fine and tells me to stop “studying” him. I’ve been with this man for so long and I know he isn’t “fine” he just doesn’t want to talk about his anxiety. 

I’m looking for advice on here bc I would 1. Really like to help him with this and 2. People are starting to not want him around. And tbh I’m starting to feel the same. Even when I’m just visiting with my family and he stops over - once he gets there it ruins my time bc I’m embarrassed of his behavior and I feel like I have to supervise him from getting into things. 

Thanks in advance for the advice."
Anxiety,Alcohol saves me right now,"Tomorrow is stressful day for me and alcohol is keeping calm. First day at my new job, I lost my previous one."
Anxiety,Husband has covid 19,"He has had it/tested positive since last Saturday. I tested negative. Fevers every single day, coughing, slight pneumonia, exhaustion. Every day is an endless loop of stress and anxiety. He is quarantined to our bedroom and I wear a mask to take him food, water, meds, and check his oxygen levels as well as temperature. His cough keeps me up all night. I don't even know if what I'm doing is helping. I'm just so anxious most of the day. :( both scared he's gonna get worse and scared of getting sick.  I don't wish this on anyone. He isn't getting any worse but also isn't getting better yet. :( this is all so isolating, scary, and stressful."
Anxiety,Sertraline/physical symptoms.,"I have lots of chest discomfort/pressure, some full pain here and there, fast heart rate at times, and get out of breath easy doing everyday things I’ve always done. I’ve had EKGs done and had to wear a holter moniter and it all came back normal.  My doctor said it was anxiety and put me on sertraline 25mgs, I’ve been on it about a month now.

Does sertraline help the physical symptoms go away? How long does it usually take?"
Anxiety,I wonder...,"I wonder what it's like to feel comfortable around people.

I wonder what it's like to feel confident in yourself and not zero in on every one of my imperfections.

I wonder what it's like to know that I'm not just being tolerated, but that I'm actually wanted.

I wonder just how bad my brain fucked my life up as opposed to if I were ""normal"".

I just wonder..."
Anxiety,Anxiety messed up my teenage years,"Quarantine hit me big time as I realized that I have depression. I may appear alright on the outside but inside, I feel so much weight from clashes of negative feelings and thoughts inside of me. Symptoms of social anxiety, low self-esteem, loss of self-worth, insecurities, inauthenticity, and fear of being judged by other people make me say so. Just writing this makes me conscious and let me feel anxious due to the fear of making mistakes. Social anxiety frequently arises whenever I converse with other people online or even offline. I just feel like I always need to please people and because of this pressure as well as overthinking, I decided not to communicate for a year with all my friends back in HS or even some of my loved ones. I lost touch with them and it makes me feel guilty, ashamed, and feel like they should have never met me in the first place. It makes me sad that maybe I may have affected them as well because of not being there for them.


 
Playing games and entertaining myself made me able to brush off these thoughts and feelings during my first year of college and somehow I survived. However, all the symptoms were there so I was not able to develop deep relationships with anyone because of this thinking. I felt out of place because even though I was accepted by my dream school, I felt like I was not enough. I always remained in my solo dorm playing games and not conversing with anyone unless when I'm in class. I just converse in a close-ended manner and it made me sound arrogant but I just always felt so much anxiety. I did not even hang out with my college peers even once during my free time. This made me feel like they did not like me for it even though I do not comment on any bad things to them. This results in a peer of mine being depressed and ended up leaving the university which I feel like partly my fault cause I was not there for him during the first year. Other than that, I was not able to maintain any relationships with anyone since childhood due to this mentality which rose during my first year in college. Overall, I was this introverted uptight, and passive person who wanna escape from social situations and just be by myself. And I'm very much guilty of not being a good friend to anyone even since HS and makes me not want to attain any more relationships with anyone cause I might harm them as well.  


 
This also affected my academic performance which I was ashamed of because I was a consistent honor student back in HS. I was a passive learner even before but I always somehow manage to cram all my academic stuff. However, given I'm all alone, I was not able to discipline myself to study my lessons during college. I only study the midnight or morning before the exams which I know is a messed up habits. During laboratory meetings, I was always so unsure cause I don't know what to do and my hands are just so shaky due to tremors which make me feel so inferior to my labmates. Most of the time I feel like all of the people are around me watching all of my movements and this makes me not execute my tasks efficiently. I thankfully did not fail any subjects but I felt out of place and so low.


 
I never said any of these things to my parents nor any of my family members. My parents do not know anything nor believe in mental health. They were poor back then but got through it and now living a comfortable life.  This makes me feel like what I'm experiencing is nothing compared to what they've gone through. During my admission to college, my parents scolded me due to why I was given a psychological clearance to enter due to mental health reasons. They say that I was stupid about giving myself a low score in a mental health test but that was just what I felt and I didn't expect a psychological clearance. I cried that day for the first time in years. On my psychiatric appointment, I didn't want to disappoint my parents anymore so I did not fully tell her everything I feel and I messed up the chance to fix my mental health problem. But in the end, my parents were proud that I was able to pass so I felt happy for a short time. I didn't attend any further consultations even though I feel like shit. In terms of academics, they never really directly pressure me that much but they hate failure. And it lowered my self-esteem whenever they tell me that I'm an idiot or a failure whenever I make mistakes, too nervous to do something, or do not know what to do. They say all I know is academics and I don't know anything about life. Well, I guess they are somewhat true cause I do not know how to cook, wash clothes, drive, etc. (All I know is washing the dishes and they still say I'm not good). In school, my teachers say I'm a good student but at home, I feel like I don't know anything at all. It somehow invalidates all the good grades I've gotten since grade school and I think it is showing during my college year.


 
In terms of my sexuality, I'm still confused about what spectrum I am part of. My family is catholic and homophobic so I guess since childhood, I am always reserved cause I don't wanna be called gay or anything. But this constant hiding and suppression made me feel like that maybe I am. And this made me feel homophobic as well cause I'm scared to be gay, not only because of religion but because my family would not treat me right. And maybe because of my family's culture, I tended to look down on people who are gay which I know I should not do. As of now, there were many women who I felt could have been my girlfriend but due to bad mental health as well as confusing stage, I did not forego with it and maybe treated them badly. I just don't want to hurt them. On the other hand, I tend to be attracted to some men which are due to their masculinity or qualities I lack... I feel like I am missing on in life cause everyone seems like having a good
time finding their mate while here I am not knowing what to do with my life.



I am being pushed right now to become a doctor and on a pre-med track so I don't have a choice. And I kinda feel that this is the right path for me cause I wanna help people but the thing is I don't want my mental health to be the reason for a person to die. I wanna figure myself out and not able to interact with anyone is not helping. I'm just so scared to reach out to people offline or online due to this mental health. The feeling of guilt as well as social anxiety makes me so limited as a person. I don't know what to say and due to overthinking I always feel like what I say may be judged differently to what I intended to say. Should I apologize to them? Should I just casually say Hi and just go with it as nothing happened? I feel like they are angry with me or already have forgotten me and maybe don't want me in their life anymore because of how I treated our relationship. And maybe I would go back to this mindset again and ended up ghosting them like before. I just feel like it's okay that I will be the only one to be hurt than risk hurting anyone by how I treat them. I wanted to change but I'm just losing hope right now.
 


I'm just masking it off with a smile and laugh as well as playing games or watching movies but deep inside me, I'm hurting to how my relationships came to be. I don’t know why I'm writing this but I just want to let this all out. Maybe I'm just making excuses or playing victim on how I'm a horrible person. And sometimes I feel like I am. I just lost my voice to speak out or know what I really feel but at least I can write what I think I'm feeling now here.
 


I'm sorry for the bad word choice, sentence construction and grammar.  I know it's messed up like how I am right now."
Anxiety,Anyone ever developed a stress ulcer?,"Last week has been the most stressful and scariest time of my life. The following weeks I will be in the process of pursuing the legal system regarding some personal issues so I know I will be even more stressed. The last couple of days my stomach hurt so bad I couldn’t sleep, and the pain would subside with painkillers and antacids. I’m already anaemic and if I develop a stress ulcer and lose blood I will be hospitalized."
Anxiety,Not sure what it is I’m doing,"Sometimes when I feel extremely overwhelmed and can’t take it, I almost squeeze myself outwards? As in I scrunch up into a ball and hold my breath but clench myself? I know it sounds super weird but I just want to know if this is common, and if so, what the word to describe it is. I hate to say it but it’s similar to if you’re constipated and are really trying to get it out haha."
Anxiety,I struggle to convince myself I even need help.,"As the title says, this has become a huge huge problem for me. I feel as if every day I have to keep on convincing myself that I should see a therapist or psychologist, but then there's times when I'm doing great and it falls to the wayside.

I have to keep reminding myself of all the times I've panicked, or have my anxiety and racing thoughts fuck me over, causing me to act out or whatnot. I have to remember the constant feelings of being overwhelmed with everything and being stuck in a hole I can't get out of. My worst fear is that my issues aren't even genuine and that I'm ""forcing"" myself to act this way to get attention.

I've tried before. I've talked with GPs only to get turned away without even a referral to anyone save some silly support group because apparently anxiety is normal, and this leaves such a bad taste in my mouth that it puts me off even trying."
Anxiety,These storm front-induced panic and anxiety attacks can eat a bag of dicks.,"I’ve noted my triggers over the past couple of years. Went for a short walk with my husband (because I know exercise helps overall with tamping down anxiety). Wouldn’t you know it the heat and humidity brought it on, and now I’m short of breath despite 99% SpO2 levels. Feeling dizzy. Patched throat despite proper hydration.

No new symptoms. Color is still good. 

If anyone has any strategies other than the usual bag of tricks, I’m open to reading them."
Anxiety,job interviews,"I haven't told anyone except my boyfriend about this job opportunity because I'm scared of jinxing it, or hyping it up to people and then having to tell them I didnt get it. it's starting to feel like not talking about it is making my anxiety worse, mostly because I can't express my anxiety about the interviews or waiting without explaining my excitement or the potential job. 

the worst part about it is the waiting. I've gone through three rounds of interviews with them so far. one with the recruiter, one with their marketing manager, and one with their ""head of experience."" after every interview, it's taken about a week to hear back from their recruiter about moving forward. a day or two after the third interview, the CEO viewed my linkedin profile, which made me extremely anxious. I realized that it was probably a good thing he heard my name and was looking into me, but I was still so worried that it didn't look good or professional enough. 

today, a week after the third interview, the recruiter emailed me asking for a FOURTH interview with the COO. I know this probably bodes well, a fourth interview. the CEO knows my name, has viewed my professional profile, and now I'm going to interview with the COO. but another week of waiting? 

I know this is like, the stupidest thing to be anxious about. more interviews and face time with people in the company is good, but it's so stressful. I desperately want a new job. my current employers haven't taken COVID seriously at all, pressured me to come back throughout the entire time that I was not required to be in office and aren't taking proper precautions now that everyone's back either. on top of the previous 7 years of just being all around mean to their employees. a week of waiting in between communications makes me stress and underperform at my current job, which makes me anxious I'll lose this job or get yelled at, without having another job to go to."
Anxiety,Feeling extra anxious lately,"I was supposed to move to Canada for grad school this month but I'm having to defer because of the pandemic.

Now I'm not sure what to do with my life. I lost my job and can't afford my apartment anymore so I'm moving back to my parents house. Living with them is not good for my mental health but I don't have a choice. I feel like I don't have that many friends, especially after I found out they're all renting an Airbnb together on the beach and I wasn't invited.

 I'm turning 25 soon and I just didn't think I'd be single, broke, and lonely still. I was in a serious 3 year relationship that ended a year and a half ago and I'm still not fully recovered and over him, but he moved on right away. I'm not sure what to do with myself for the next year since I was planning on starting a new life in Canada. Even before the pandemic I was unable to find a good job and I know it'll be even harder now. 

I'm in therapy, both individual and group. And it's helpful but it just feels like I'll never make and keep good friendships until I learn to better deal with this anxiety. I already lost what felt like the love of my life because my anxiety was ""too much"" and I'm trying my best not to burden or push people away. I've felt lonely my whole life and it's gotten worse in adulthood. I even had a dream last night that I was in high school an on a school trip with all these people I'm not friends with anymore. I know the problem is inside of me. It feels like my anxiety will never let me be happy and I'll keep scaring people away. 
Moving was my last hope. I just don't know how I'm going to survive this next year. The weather is going to change soon and my SAD is going to kick in. I'll be in my teenage bedroom, unemployed and lonelier than ever. 

Thanks for reading if you managed to read it all. I don't need advice just words of support or encouragement. Maybe tell me about a time you felt similar and how you got through it. Thanks ❤️"
Anxiety,therapy/anxiety podcast recommendation,"I've been listening to a podcast called Panic Attacking the past year where two comedians with anxiety disorders talk out what made them anxious this week.  Their lastest ep has a therapist that actually gives them great advice.   If you've never been to a therapist I suggest you check it out because it really gave me insight into the process and now I'm considering going to one

EDIT: forgot to include a link, here is their soundcloud, the episode is 63:  https://soundcloud.com/panicattackingpodcast/episode-63-panicking-about-trouble-sleeping-and-sailing"
Anxiety,I might need to have my appendix removed and I'm freaking out,"Basically the title. I feel absolutely nauseous right now. I go to see my doc in an hour because my right side was hurting yesterday and is still a bit tender today. It hurt right under my belly button when I bent over to grab something off the floor too. I'm so nervous and anxious when I wasn't before, and the person I usually talk to is just.. not talking back rn. idk what to do."
Anxiety,Im freaking out....,"Long story short, my gf took a pregnancy test and a faint line appeared but it looks to be a evaporation line...

Theres no possible way she could be pregnant, we did not have PIV Sex, I fingered her but never went inside, just rubbed her clit, shes on birth control?!?! 

Am I freaking out or do I have a reason to be concerned. Theres just no possible way..."
Anxiety,Car Accident Tested My Limits,"I almost can't believe this really happened it's such a yarn of a story.  A month ago, I bought myself a new (used) car.  Last Tuesday, the afternoon of the 7th, I had just gotten back to my car in the parking lot and was opening it up to cool off.  Then all of a sudden, a lady driving her whole family backs up into the passenger side of my car.  It was low speed, and just made 6 or 7 dents, but it started me and disappointed me since I had just gotten the car.  I immediately told msyelf to keep my cool, though, to get pen and paper so I could collect her information.  I went right to reminding myself not to discuss fault, take lots of pictures, I looked up whether I had to call the police.  

The problem is, as soon as the accident happened, the lady and her husband both jump out of the car and begin LOUDLY shouting at each other.  GOD DAMMIT... WEREN'T LOOKING..BACKUP CAMERA..CANT BELIEVE YOU.  

Before I can get a sentence in the husband literally runs off, which makes me very suspicious, and the wife is trembling and crying slightly.  I feel terrible because I'm trying to simultaneously keep myself calm, reassure this lady who has three young children in the backseat, but also press her for all her info to make sure I don't just get hung out to dry.  The whole 15 minutes we are exchanging info, emailing each other, taking our own sets of pictures, her husband never returns.  And she mentions intermittently how she's scared to death about him flipping out.  So, I am trying to keep taking deep breaths and do all the mental gymnastics of wearing these different hats, plus I'm now trying to decide if I should call the police for this lady's protection from her unstable angry husband, or whether it could make things even worse (maybe they'd get in more trouble for not having a car seat for their youngest, who looked about 5?). There was just so much going on, and keeping myself from taking up the mother's panicked state occupied me as is.

Anyways, now a few days have passed and the repairs are almost resolved, but I keep thinking about if I should have done something different, if the family is okay, whether it's my place to get involved in anything other than the insurance process."
Anxiety,Never leave my house,I have a hard time finding motivation to leave my house. Even if it’s something I like doing I’ll never go. I get nervous whenever I have to talk to new people and it’s scary to leave. I also never want to leave I find almost no fun in anything I do anymore. I go to bed at 3 and wake up at 1 play video games and watch YouTube repeat.
Anxiety,Does anyone else immediately start to feel anxious when their partner is upset at them?,"Every time my girlfriend says she's hurt or upset by something I've said, I go straight to feeling anxious. I start to blame myself and keep apologizing and then I won't let go of it for ages.
I don't want her to start tiptoeing around me. I don't want her to feel like she has to keep things to herself, but she doesn't want me to start blaming myself
I just wish I could stop this habit"
Anxiety,figured out why im terrified of hospitals,"I didn't really realize this before, but im probably scared of hospitals because of how much time I spent in them when I was a baby. I was born three months premature bc my mom had severe preeclampsia which obviously meant I was high risk, underdeveloped, and needed to be monitored closely for a long time aka many many hospital visits and shots and stuff even after I was sent home two months after my birth. I've had so many shots my mom jokes that I glow in the dark. I probably started associating hospitals with pain, but since I can't remember anything about any of this, my guess is my brain subconsciously remembers it.

honestly, I don't really care about the atmosphere of hospitals. or the look or the sounds or anything. I just get anxious from the smell. anything that smells like a hospital gives me major anxiety and every time I go my heartbeat ramps up to like 120bpm immediately. I remember once in high school I was sitting in Spanish and someone used hand sanitizer and I wasn't expecting it nor did I notice so when I smelled the alcohol my heart instantly jumped and sped up for a second (since that kind of alcohol smell would typically be in a hospital). my mom told me people are normally afraid of hospitals but is it to the extent of getting anxious from smelling hand sanitizer in class by accident? do yall know if people are scared like this? it seemed a little weird when she said it but I don't really know"
Anxiety,Help Anxiety Attack!,"I'm sorry to bother you who ever answers, i'm just having a really bad anxiety attack right now.

I can't stop worrying about him and his appointment tomorrow.  Can anyone help me"
Anxiety,am i the only one who feels like my head is blank all the time?,"I have this constant pressure in my skull like my brain is pushing against it. it's almost a headache. it's on the verge of being painful, but it's not. I feel like im losing my ability to think. im not sure how to explain it. it's like my brain is blocking part of my processing ability so my brain is blank a lot and I have a hard time focusing which comes along with terrible memory. I have a lot of fleeting thoughts, but it's only because I can't focus. they're more like daydreams, honestly. anyone else like this? how do I fix it?"
Anxiety,My massage therapist asked me if I’ve been having headaches,"I’ve been incredibly anxious for weeks, more than usual. So stressed that I started getting splitting headaches nonstop. I’ve been scared I have a brain tumour or something, I’ve also been dizzy. 

I visited my massage therapist for a deep tissue work up on my back after months due to covid, she really went at it. Mid massage she stops after it’s been quiet for some time and asks “have you been getting bad headaches?” I reply surprised that yes, I have been having awful headaches. Well turns out my back/shoulders/neck are so tense she was not shocked at all when I said “how did you know??”.

Anxiety is messed up what it does to your body, all my dizziness, headaches, physical symptoms all attributed to being so tense from anxiety."
Anxiety,"I NEED to drop out college, but I trapped because of my ANXIETY","I’ve been procrastinating for the 2 months about dropping out engineering school. I already made the decision that I’m going drop out and do a gap year, but I’m procrastinating on actually going through the process. 

It’s so bad that I’ve been avoiding going to my school college account, or checking my emails incase of emails from my school advisor. There are so many aspects of this trigger my anxiety: what will my professor who know me think of me (the school is quite small and tight-nit), what will the advisor think of me, having to tell my parents about my decision.

I been losing sleep because this, and the more I procrastinate I know the worse its going to get. Everytime I even think about doing it my anxiety spikes up, and I start spiralling and worrying and panicking, and eventually Just push it off to the next day or week or month. Does sound like severe anxiety or a panic attack disorder, I’m not sure.

What should I do????? The more I procrastinate the more helpless I become

(Sorry for my bad english, I’m french)"
Anxiety,Anyone else feeling guilty always?,I always feel guilty for being rude and sometimes have lost my mind over things.And another thing is I feel guilty over wasting time
Anxiety,Rough week = spiraling Friday,"I went to the ER earlier this week for non-anxiety, non-COVID reasons. Came out with an “omg what if I got covid” low-grade anxiety that’s been with me since (and got exacerbated when my allergy meds were out of whack after a missed dose).

Sent out a report with an after the fact realized mistake. Was it material? No. The number is a best guess anyways. Still on repeat in my head.

Also it’s been a light AF week at work. Like, me needing 12 hrs of sick time didn’t really put any of my projects behind schedule / behind due so WTF would I have done the last two days if my body didn’t hate me? 

Only logged 38 hours, which makes me anxious too because I freak out that my *salary* will be garnished if I don’t hit 40+ each week (it’s been threatened/done at previous firms when “salaried”, but, frankly, I’ve worked enough 50 to 60s that it shouldn’t matter if I’m two hours light one to two weeks in 8 months)

Also had a shift in my schedule due to fieldwork... which means my day starts and ends an hour later (so 8-5) for the week and I felt a bit judged when I said I had a previously scheduled therapy appointment that I can’t miss outside of my normal hours (7-4). I’ll figure it out with the other inspector Monday.

Also my damn company is giving me anxiety because I feel like we’re rushing the return to work. I also get uncomfortable when I’m the only masked person on job sites (that’s on the other contractors though).

And there is also the part of me that wants to call and make sure the movers next month wear masks because it’s simple decency to wear one and protect the people around youD"
Anxiety,I'm tired man.,"I've had anxiety (mainly health anxiety) since I was 11. I'm 27 years old now. I've gone to therapy, taken so many different meds, tried all kinds of techniques. Nothing works. Actually that isn't true, Xanax worked for about five years until I got off it this year because I couldn't handle the withdrawal symptoms anymore whenever I couldn't get it filled on time. Since then the NP who prescribes my meds and helped me get off it wont give me anything strong anymore. I get eight 2mg pills of Valium a month and that's it. I'm also on propranolol and that helped a bit in the beginning but it stopped after about four months. 

My anxiety has been steadily getting worse. And the virus has everyone's up. I don't really have depression but the past couple of weeks I've kinda had suicidal thoughts? I just want the anxiety to stop. I want to stop worrying about every pain, every tiny thing I feel. I keep manifesting new anxiety symptoms, for example I have a bit of an issue with my gums caused by dry mouth from years of taking anti anxiety meds. Now I'm suddenly having tons of aches and pains in my teeth and I can't stop moving my mouth and tongue. It's maddening. I've also started waking up not able to breathe. I can't really fall asleep anytime before 5am.

I just, am tired. I'm tired of feeling anxious. I'm tired of people not understanding how I'm feeling. My mother tells me ""you just need a good nights sleep"". I just want to be normal or feel normal. It's like this feeling is never gonna end. It seems like every night I'm in frustrated tears and nothing I do helps."

Anxiety,looking for task avoidance buddy,"Hey! I constantly avoid tasks due to severe anxiety. Like I'm worried about failing at the task, or about all the other tasks I should be doing, or just about something else in general so I can't really focus. 

The replies on [this post that isn't mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hp0mu9/anyone_else_really_struggle_with_avoidance/) made me think about getting an accountability / support (support sounds way nicer!) buddy. Would anyone be interested?:)

I'd like to use this app Focus Todo (kinda boring name lol) where you estimate how many 25minute pomodoros a task will take, and then do the pomodoros. Having a fixed ""end time"" like that kinda takes my starting/doing anxiety away, even if I might overshoot that time.

Also, you can grow cute trees from doing pomodoros and completing tasks, yay for cuteness.

Finally, there's a private chatroom where both of us can support each other and also chat about other interests if you like.

Please comment / message if you're interested, or even if you're not, if you have any ideas and tips re: the above! :)"
Anxiety,over the counter help?,"Currently i’m on lexepro for my anxiety, and depression. I’ve been on like 5-6 other ones but they all gave me an “out of touch” feeling which i hate, but lexepro doesn’t. i’m on vyvance for adhd (just mentioning incase that might change anything) 
I’m in the process of getting diagnosed with BPD. which sucks. my doctor got isn’t available because his office got shut down, the issue is that i was planning on asking him for help and now i cannot. 
My anxiety and depression have been extremely awful. I can’t sleep, i can’t eat sometimes, i isolate myself, and basically self loathe in my room and cry all day. Obviously i don’t like that haha. I’m posting to this to ask if any of you have any recommendations of things that i could try, that don’t need a prescription. like a supplement or vitamin or anything really. i haven’t had much luck. and it’s hard staying on track when i can’t get out of bed anymore bc of my anxiety. so please, if anyone has advice of anything i can try i would GREATLY appreciate it:( 
i wanted to mention:  i don’t smoke weed, i get psychosis sometimes and weed makes it much worse. not against it or anything, just not for me.
also: anything that will “cloud” my head, or put my at risk of psychosis couldn’t work for me :( i’m not against anything except things that will put me at psychosis risk, previously when this happens i would flip out and make things ten times worse.
please let me know ❤️"
Anxiety,My take as a former anxiety sufferer,"*I write this with the hope that it inspires somebody, or at the very least helps them look at their anxiety in a different way. This shouldn’t be taken as a diagnosis or a suggestion in any way.*

I used to post on this sub frequently under a different account, usually using the “venting” flair. I used to have panic attacks that left me debilitated, and didn’t have a place I knew I could alieve my stresses at; this often left me hiding in my room for days and using drugs to help me ignore everything. I eventually landed myself in the hospital and was given a GAD and bipolar depression diagnosis. I had the worst year of my life while trying to navigate medications, coping methods, and most of all *my identity as a person with mood disorders.*

Notice, in the title, I call myself a “former anxiety *sufferer*.” This does not mean I don’t still have anxiety, I just found my own way to stop *suffering* from it. I still have moments where I get wound up, and my mind races to a point where I can’t handle it; but the thing that has helped me the most is recognizing what triggers me (or is prone to upset me) and trying to find ways to alleviate ending up in those situations. I made locking myself in my room an unacceptable answer, and hardest of all was changing my lifestyle to give myself less anxiety.

My tip is not to blame anxiety itself for being the issue. We have to accept that it is already a part of us. It will always be there, as that random scramble in your brain, or that thought that you can’t handle something; but each of us has a special form of anxiety, and we all owe it to ourselves to search for our own special ways of *living* and *working with* our anxieties, and no longer *suffering* from them.

My PMs are open, bless you all and I hope the best."
Anxiety,"My psychiatrist is convinced I suffer from anxiety, yet I'm confident I don't.","I was diagnosed with moderate ADHD by a private psychiatrist, and upon trying to obtain my medication through the NHS, another psychiatrist has rejected my diagnosis of ADHD in favour of depression and anxiety.

I've had two phone consultations with this psychiatrist who is attributing all of my ADHD symptoms to anxiety, which I *know* I don't suffer from. These symptoms include severe problems with my attention span and motivation, my procrastination pervades even my recreational activities, binge eating disorder, circadian rhythm disorder, etc. Heck, I've taken stimulants in the past and they made me feel less restless. Fortunately, he dropped the diagnosis of depression in my second consultation, as it's very clear that I don't suffer from it. 

I hardly qualify for any of the psychological symptoms for anxiety. I'm not an excessive worrier in the slightest, I'm actually care-free for the most part. The only symptom I experience from this department is restlessness, which is almost a required symptom of ADHD. Even if I consider the list of physical symptoms for anxiety as listed on the NHS website, I hardly meet any of them. Until I researched what anxiety was after I had been diagnosed with it, I didn't realise just how ignorant I was regarding this disorder because I really don't experience any of the symptoms.

* Dizziness (never) 
* Tiredness (very rarely) 
* A noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (never) 
* Muscle aches and tension (never) 
* Trembling or shaking (never) 
* Dry mouth (never) 
* Excessive sweating (never) 
* Shortness of breath (never) 
* Stomach aches (never) 
* Feeling sick (very rarely) 
* Headaches (never) 
* Pins and needles (very rarely) 
* Difficulty falling or staying asleep (I don't have trouble initiating sleep. 75% of people with ADHD also have DSPD) 

Just exactly what angle is this psychiatrist coming from here? I've spoken to numerous friends and family who suffer from anxiety, and they all told me that I'm one of the least anxious people they knew."
Anxiety,someone please take caffeine away from me,"i have identified again and again that i should NOT be having caffeine. it induces a deathly feeling of anxiety for me and kind of builds up throughout the day, lasting HOURS after i've actually had the drink, and before i know it, i'm up at 3am rocking back and forth in bed and falling asleep at sunrise.

i always forget this because initially when i see boba milk tea or a green tea latte, my brain just goes ""ooooo yummy"" and i drink most of it before i start feeling off and i realize what terrible thing i've done. 

anyone else do this, or got any ways to make the feeling go away quicker? share your experience? i always drink a lot of water to try to 'flush' it out, but it doesn't do much for me. i'm expecting to fall asleep at 6am, maybe 4 or 5 if i'm lucky and it wears off earlier than usual when i make this mistake."
Anxiety,Why our brain loves to look for something wrong?,"For me this is especially apparent when I’m starting a relationship.

First I would worry that he is not that into me. This led to anxiety and I would constantly check his last online to make sure everything is okay, and if he did not respond immediately I would start to overthink and overanalyze

Then I would worry that he will lose interest with me. Repeat the things I’ve done for the first anxiety

And now that I’m sure he is into me, I have anxiety that I might not be attracted to him. This led to compulsions to check his picture or messages to see my response.

And then I’m worried that he will leave soon, or that the demons of my anxiety will ruin our relationship, etc etc

Why our brain loves to look for something wrong?"
Anxiety,Why am I still getting panic attacks over something that happened 5 years ago?,"I’m 19M and I was 14 years old when my dad who was suffering from brain cancer decided to take his own life in my room, since that cursed day I’ve been feeling like life is just pain and pain then death. My parents were already drunk hitting me to sleep every day talking about divorce and stuff but I’ve gotten over all of that. but last year in biology class i had this very weird feeling as if my soul was getting pulled out of my body while feeling like I’m on the edge with very heavy nausea, shaking and sweating heavily and it made me so anxious that i hated school and my teachers didn’t believe me nor my mom did so i ended up failing the year and now I’m on the finals of the same repeated year yet i still get these feeling but now it escalated to puking for hours before every final. I’ve tried therapy and it made it worse so if anyone has some experience with this please help me. 
Thank you for reading."
Anxiety,Why do I end up crying for the smallest inconveniences?,Its the smallest shit that makes the alligator tears come out.

Anxiety,Anxiety is so scary.,"I’ve been having anxiety in my heart region for a few days now. And it’s so scary. I can’t sleep or go about regular daily life without having untrue thoughts. Thoughts I know aren’t true but the thought of it scares me, making my heart drop. But I know myself. And what I’m thinking is absurd and makes no sense. 
The part I hate is that I don’t know where it even came from. At all. It’s like someone poured it on me at random and there’s no source for it. 
I can’t sleep, I can’t really do anything. Today was better, and the anxiety is now coming and going at random times.
But I feel it in my chest, in my heart area. 
My fear is that what if my anxiety won’t go away? I don’t want to live like this; with this over my head. 
I overthink and wonder maybe this is punishment for this or that. It’s so scary. I was feeling like, what if my anxiety is true? But I know it’s not.
My anxiety stays within my heart region so I basically like to say it makes my chest hurt and my heart “has anxiety” 
Also, I was feeling unsafe the other day. Like am I okay? Am I safe? Am I a good person? What is this? It makes me almost want to cry. And then I think about when I didn’t have anxiety and I was just a child. It makes me so sad.
I have shortness of breath and my chest hurts. 
My mind needs to be cleared and Sometimes I’m struck with the fear of always staying like this, sometimes even thinking I’m going to die or my life is over.
It’s a terrifying experience. 

Last time I had anxiety like this was in late 2019, around maybe September or October. 

I hope and pray this blows over soon. Please if you can send me good vibes and prayers. 
I need to know if I’m safe. That’s all"
Anxiety,Email anxiety,"I just had to send an email to the leader of my school’s music department to cancel an audition I had scheduled(as I realised I was too overcommitted and was already in a similar band), but as I sent the email I just got these waves of anxiety that made it hard for me to send it:
- what if the music coordinator thinks my email shows that I’m actually incompetent and has less faith in me?
- what if he misreads it and I somehow get kicked out of the band I’m already in?

These anxious thoughts lengthened writing the email to an unreasonable amount of time, and I can’t help but feel it would’ve been way more concise had I been able to think clearly. 

Obviously these things are not rational at all but they kept me from sending that email, and now I can’t focus on anything as I anxiously anticipate their response, which will probably be complying and reasonable.

I feel like I go through this pattern anytime I send an email to an authority figure, and I was wondering if anyone experiences anything similar?"
Anxiety,My mind thinks that I am sick.....,"So yeah this keeps happening to me since lockdown atarted 4 months ago and I am tired of it. Waking up with stuffy nose and sneezing? Covid. Feeling tired or weak? Covid. A little headache because of too much smartphone usage? Covid. Feeling something that hurts in my body or having a fast heart rate? Covid. After experiencing this, im having a hard time breathing and feeling weak. 

Even though im playing games to forget everything about this pandemic but my mind keeps telling me about it."
Anxiety,Social anxiety,"My anxiety is the fucking worst, I finished high school this year and holy shit I am glad to be done with it.

Anyway, I’ve been out of work for about 4 months because of COVID and that has made my anxiety worse. I would get some panic attacks before work because I overthink a shit ton. I feel like I do a good job interacting and making good eye contact, but sometimes I would always have to take a shot because of how bad my anxiety is. I’m starting college next month and I’m taking a major that I’m not confident in being successful in. I feel very lost in this world because my social anxiety is stopping me from doing anything. I feel sick to my stomach anytime I have to interact with anyone and overthink the worst possible situation. I feel like I can’t get anything fucking done because I’m too stupid and unmotivated to do anything. I really don’t have many friends and idk I’m just really lost and scared for the future. I would really love if y’all could give me some advice!"

I feel like I do a good job interacting and making good eye contact, but sometimes I would always have to take a shit at work because of how bad my anxiety is. I’m starting college next month and I’m taking a major that I’m not confident in being successful in. I feel very lost in this world because my social anxiety is stopping me from doing anything. I feel sick to my stomach anytime I have to interact with anyone and overthink the worst possible situation. I feel like I can’t get anything fucking done because I’m too stupid and unmotivated to do anything. I really don’t have many friends and idk I’m just really lost and scared for the future. I would really love if y’all could give me some advice!"
Anxiety,Does anyone get cleaning anxiety?,"This has been crippling me ever since I have been responsible for looking after myself. I can’t clean - when I do it is so unbelievably painful I never do a proper job.

I wake up every morning with the full intention of sorting my room. I will go to throw stuff away and this horrible weight takes over me. Today I had a full blown panic attack picking up the smallest bit of trash.

Has anyone been able to overcome this, if so please tell me how. I’m living in squalor and I want out."
Anxiety,"I'm going through a health crisis and have almost completely socially withdrawn from friends and family. This is an abnormal reaction, right?","I've been going through health problems since March that are potentially very bad, almost life threatening. I'm still under investigation and during this period in my life I have almost completely socially withdrawn from the people I know. I'm a college student [F23] that lives alone and I'm currently visiting my parents for the first time in 6 months. They know about my health issues but I've told them not to bring it up with me. My best friend still doesn't know the severity of it, I've told her that I'm sick and thats it without going into specifics. 

I've met my friends a couple of times since March and I'm generally just quiet, withdrawn, have no energy what so ever to engage in small talk etc. I'm known in my friend group for being a positive and funny outgoing person, and I think I'm just not that person anymore.

Generally speaking, I've always been emotionally distant and kept to myself in times of crisis. But I don't think I've ever been this disconnected and withdrawn. I have a feeling that it's an abnormal reaction since most people seek out support in times of crisis while I'm unable, on an emotional basis, to do that. I'm worried about my mental health and where this is going long term. I'm yet to recieve a final terminal diagnosis but the day I do that, I don't think it's going to be pretty.

Advice and support is much appreciated."
Anxiety,I’m too terrified to apply for a job and fear that I’ll never get one. Are there any jobs suitable for people with SA?,"I [f16] have severe SA, which has led to a couple panic attacks. These past couple of months, my friends have started applying for jobs, and my parents think that I should too. 

The problem is, I don’t think I’m qualified for any entry level job, as they all require good communication skills and are usually fast paced. The thought of having to do an interview and interacting with customers/coworkers absolutely terrifies me. I started to get bullied around 7th grade (and still do), so I hate the thought of being judged, laughed at, or being the subject of gossiping. Due to social rejection, I have no friends and virtually no social skills. 

How do I overcome my SA in a workplace? Are there any jobs suitable for people with SA?"
Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my life,"Hey all. Anxiety has always been a part of my life as it is with many others, but it really became apparent four years ago, when I got a scholarship for a private school. Ever since then, Ive has a problem with anxiety. I also think I have some OCD problems and I am antisocial. I have a phobia of vomiting, which is the result of anxiety and OCD, as well as social anxiety. Having social and normal anxiety and symptoms of OCD have been a torment. This combination is one of the worst and I’m assuming it’s common. I can’t sleep because of my anxiety. It’s taken over my life. My OCD has always been here and I never knew it was OCD, just something everyone had and acted on. I don’t think I can fix my OCD but I think I can do something about my anxiety. My main struggles of social anxiety. With school coming up, I worry a lot about how I’m going to fit in and how everyone will see me. Last year was tough, and this year feels like it will be the death of me. I’ve had many small panic attacks today. I’ve never been suicidal but right now a way out of this seems super nice. I don’t expect my anxiety to ever leave. Just like my OCD, it will always be part of my life, but I want to tone it down. I sound somewhat calm, but I am very anxious and I don’t have anyone I feel I can talk to. I want some help from some strangers on the internet, because I’m pretty sure that the best I’ll get."
Anxiety,Worried about switching schools,"I’m going into my junior year of high school and I feel incredibly lost. For the past 2 years I went to a private school that I hated. It was expensive, I didn’t genuinely like a single person there except some seniors who have graduated now, it made me feel poor compared to other kids who drove Maserati’s and Tesla’s, the classes weren’t challenging enough, I had to stay from 8-5:30 every day and it was 20 minutes away from my
house, I hated the dress code, the mandatory sports were a joke, I developed bad clinical depression and ended up skipping class at least once a week to cry in the bathroom. I didn’t want to leave though because I felt attached to some teachers and some people there even though I found them obnoxious and stupid and immature for the most part. Also because I don’t really have any other options, my public school is shit and Ive been to easy schools all my life so I would die if I started in public school junior year, and all the other private schools are too expensive or far away, and I wanted to have a real high school experience but I realized I wasn’t gonna ever get what I wanted from that place anyway. Since corona started I felt like I never had to see any of those people again or ever go back and I didn’t mind at all. It made it a lot easier to make the decision to leave.

The thing is, I’m most likely going to do online school. I’m excited about it because I really want to start managing my time better, become more self disciplined, and I love the idea of designing my own curriculum and I want to get a job and start developing a healthier, happier lifestyle but it’s all so scary to me now because I don’t know if I can trust myself to do that. The past few months have been shit, at the beginning of quarantine I was super motivated but eventually I started sleeping through and skipping all my online classes and barely getting out of bed and just eating shit and doing nothing all day besides getting high and going on my phone. It’s made me so depressed because I’m so lonely and bored, but how do I know that won’t be the case when school starts again? What if everything is still closed and I don’t end up getting a job or doing any extra curriculars? I don’t want to be more depressed and I don’t want all my friends to be having fun and succeeding at school while I lie at home bored and depressed, though if everything is shut down again we’ll all be online anyway. I’m hoping to god that that’s gonna happen because I’m also really scared that I’m gonna miss it and wish I hadn’t left even though I know I probably wouldn’t be happy there. 

I just don’t even have any realistic worries other than self doubt and I know why I’m making this decision and why I shouldn’t worry but I can’t stop feeling such dread wash over me when I think about the upcoming school year. I’m just so scared and lost and lonely right now."
Anxiety,DOUBT is messing me up,"I’ve (24F) been anxious for as long as I’ve breathed (as rina sawayama said, the pain in my vein is hereditary) (except no one in my family tree admits they have anxiety) and I usually KNOW when I’m anxious. it’s the heart palpitations, tremors, sudden caffeine intolerance, etc. but lately (or since I was on SNRIs like effexor and recently cymbalta) I’ve been heavily doubting myself. it could be that I heavily repress my worries by distracting myself to the point that I have NO idea what I’m anxious about, but I would ask myself if these palpitations and tremors r just my body throwing a tantrum at me. instead of doing something to calm this anxiety, I find myself.....arguing w myself? ‘are u even anxious or just used to being anxious’ ‘what do u even have to be anxious about’ etc etc. to top it off, Ativan renders me fatigued for a day or two so even though I’m jobless and just lazing around the house, I don’t wanna take it often in case my mum freaks out about me going into another depressive episode. 

I’m sorry for ranting but I just want to know I’m not the only one losing my mind over this stupid thing. and yes I see a therapist but I don’t vibe well w her - might be cos I’m very self aware and irritable rn lol"
Anxiety,FREEZING UP WHEN TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONS,"Hi guys,

So my boyfriend never used to do this at the start of the relationship, but overtime whenever we have a deep conversation about problems in our relationship he goes silent and forgets everything we've just talked about. I need HELP on how to get him over this.

Once he's gone silent that's it, he doesn't remember anything and doesn't know how he feels. I have tried; remaining silent and waiting patiently, reminding him of what we just spoke about, repeating things, trying prompts or asking him questions and so on. He's had trouble in the past with expressing his emotions but as he has been with me he is a lot better with that until this started happening.

I understand that when we get stressed our brain can make us forget things because its stressful, but that doesn't solve the problem. PLEASE HELP its causing our problems to be everlasting"
Anxiety,I have minor anxiety; mainly about global warming,"I really need some advice. My anxiety comes in waves, like for a couple weeks I am shaking all day and then after I don’t have a worry in the world. Right now I’m in one of those humps and am really struggling. I try to do all I can to support GB. I don’t use any electricity that I don’t have too but it’s kind of a loop because when I’m having this anxiety all I can do is watch YouTube and then that’s using so much electricity so it’s like a negative feedback loop. If you can give 1. Advice to deal with anxiety 2. Good news about the prevention of global warming(I just need stuff to make me feel better about the situation) or 3. Stuff to do when in a state of anxiety that doesn’t involve screens, please tell me :)"
Anxiety,Anxiety and Fast Food Job-Need to quit without panicking or backing out?,"My shift starts in three hours, I was hoping to put in my two weeks notice either today or tomorrow. I'm worried that they might urge me not to quit since finding someone to work in the pandemic isn't easy and so many people are gone. The job with the added stress of COVID-19 is so anxiety inducing that it's been affecting my body physically. I've been suffering from bad headaches and upper back pain from all the built up anxiety just smiling and pretending everything is okay when I'm surrounded in chaos. Fast food has made my mental health so bad and when I think my self esteem couldn't get any lower, some customer or coworker always manages to make a new record. I can't sleep, I have no energy, I'm exhausted and just overall completely defeated. 

I really need to get out. I've been having to see a chiropractor because of the pain and tension overwhelming anxiety causes when it's contained for hours. She says my back is really tense, will need regular appointments to fix and that I need to quit. But I don't know how to do it without giving in to the guilt trip, concern, questions, etc. I always feel obligated to stay extra hours, pick up shifts when they ask even though it ruins my plans and day. When I say no they always say things like ""are you sure?"" and ""we need you"" or ""why not? what's more important?"" How do I get the message across that I can't work here respectfully and firmly? I tried to quit last week but chickened out. Thanks.  

TL;DR Need to quit job but scared"
Anxiety,I’m freaking out right now as I’m typing this I feel sick to my stomach and feel like a bad panic attack is coming,"So I’ve been taking lexapro for about 6-7 months now haven’t feel much of an improvement but haven’t felt any negative effects either there’s some days I missed a dose but
I’ve been super consistent and taking them daily. But today I woke up freaking out and even when typing this I can’t calm down I don’t know what’s going on 

I want to wean myself off this drug and get off of it. I don’t see any improvements or any lower anxiety then before 

I don’t know what’s causing this horrifying panic attack my body feels so damn weird. 

I tried calling my general doctor but they won’t pick up. I left multiple voice messages they haven’t responded back. 

My thoughts are very strange and very weird. My body feels like it wants to shut down it’s a very scary feeling. And for the most part my anxiety has been under control but I don’t think it was because of the meds but because of my sleep I was sleeping a lot better and whenever I sleep better I’m more mentally and emotionally better. It’s 7am now at the time of writing this and I went to sleep around 4am so I haven’t slept for shit. I just nothing bad is actually happening. I feel like I need to be rushed to the hospital or something. I don’t wanna die. What should I do? 

How do I wean myself off this drug? I’ll give them another call and see what happens. Hopefully I can reach them"
Anxiety,"I’m so confused, I have no idea how I feel or if I’m faking emotions...","Look I don’t expect anyone to respond to this or even understand it, it’s so confusing in my head that I don’t even know how to type it. 

 I’m really confused, I have no idea how I feel.... Im male, 16 and was diagnosed with anxiety about 2 years ago. The thing is, I’m super social - I play piano without stage fright, I used to do drama and loved performing, I’m always Cracking jokes and adore hanging out with my friends. Some days though, I just don’t want to talk to anyone, not because I’m sad or angry it’s just too hard. I won’t respond to messages and I’ll just do my own thing, it’s almost like I can’t maintain the effort to speak to them. I’ve dealt with that for a while though, that’s not the issue I’m facing at the moment...

For context, about 4 weeks ago one of my friends found out about something I did to betray their trust about a year and a half ago. I won’t get into detail but all you need to know is that I was 100% in the wrong and have felt guilty ever since, I could never tell them though because I was terrified of losing my friendship. This person was and still is to Me, my closest friend - one of the few people I’d take time out of my day to talk to no matter what and no matter when. I trusted them more than anyone in the world and I like to think they thought the same about me. Since they found out about what I did though, Ive avoided my friend group - I felt too terrible to face them and felt they needed time and space. Don’t worry, Ive still talked to the person about it since, apologised, given them space etc. and at the moment it seems like we can restore our friendship to what it was, it’ll just take time. They miss me, I miss them, we clearly both want things back to normal but it’s just hard yknow. honestly they’re an amazing person for forgiving me... however, now that you know the situation here’s my issue:

in the first 2 weeks, like I said I avoided them. I gave them space and just sat by myself in school, it was so lonely but I knew it was the right thing to do. I was terrified of being seen alone though, I hated the idea of anyone taking pity on me, so I’d usually hide in a bathroom or the music room to relax. School holidays started two weeks ago though, and since then I’ve been spending most my time at home reflecting or just keeping myself distracted playing games/piano. this is where the confusing part starts: I don’t know how to put it but, im Showing numerous symptoms of depression yet I feel like I’m faking it... I know you should never self diagnose but, I’ve been reading so many forums, articles and stories About depression and I just relate to the issues so much. I feel like I’m faking it though because the moment I distract myself with a good conversation with a friend/relative, a game, music, Social media etc. The feelings go away, well for the most part..... plus, I know this sounds crazy but... to a certain point I almost feel like I just want to be depressed.... I know that sounds terrible, and I feel like a selfish monster  saying it, especialy since I know how much people have suffered on this reddit alone... i don’t know how to explain it...this is what I mean, I don’t know how I feel....to a certain extent I’m desperate for attention, I want someone to ask me if I’m okay,  - maybe that’s why I want to be depressed. it’s weird though because on the other hand I don’t want them to find out what I’m going through, I want to keep looking happy. It’s like I want them to ask if I’m okay but also I don’t want them to know if I’m not...

I can’t tell what emotions are real and what I’m faking, I don’t know if I’m even faking anything at all. I haven’t told anyone about this because I absolutely hate people who fake mental illness’s for attention, but what if that’s exactly what I’m doing? I’d never self harm, the pain terrifies me, but I know depression is a state of numbness. Surely if I was depressed the pain wouldn’t scare me right? On the other hand I get this feeling of emptiness whenever I remember my Friendship situation - how much they would hate me, how much ive lost... I can’t even tell my mum about this so I can go to a doctor and just get diagnosed because it’s so embarrassing. Plus it’s like it comes and goes, one moment I’ll be fine then the next everything I just explained hits me and bury‘s me in my mind. So she thinks I’m perfectly fine, yet again maybe I am

as you can see, my thought process is all over the place. Another thought I had was that maybe I’m getting my symptoms of anxiety mixed up with my so called feelings of depression, I truly don’t know. It’s weird, I feel Some happiness right now... is that just proof I’m not depressed? Or maybe I’m just happy to have finally vented my fucked up thought process... what do you guys think? I truly don’t know. To anyone who did read this all though, thank you fr...

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr i fucked up a friendship and can’t tell what emotions I’m feeling or if I’m even depressed. I have anxiety and overthink everything."
Anxiety,Stomach bloating,"I started a new exercise routine after not exercising for a while. It seems every time I start a new exercise routine after a week or two, I start to have anxiety attacks.

Also, I’ve noticed that I get extremely bloated for at least a week and can’t seem to get rid of it. 

Does anyone else experience this with their anxiety?"
Anxiety,Exhausted!!,"It's funny how I can't think anymore..... How me having mental health issues make my opinions advice not fit for anything and my opinions and advices are ruled out.


I was ok on Friday maybe it was nothing maybe it was cold and I would just go on Saturday to doc to get myself checked . But on Saturday I get mental health helpline numbers coz obviously for others me giving importance to my lack of taste and smell is purely mental/ pyschological . 

‌PS - It's been 5 days i have lost sense of taste and smell."
Anxiety,"Desperate and in need of help, why am I always this way?","All in all I have a good life. I work at a job for a nonprofit education organization as the head/only teacher. I'm really well liked around my coworkers, my boss always says what a good job I'm doing for the fact that I'm getting my students through the program so quickly and Efficiently. My boss talks about giving us all raises in the next few months and that we are all a team.

I love my job so much, it's the most satisfying career I ever had, and I feel like I'm among friends when I'm there. 

I was even joking around with my boss yesterday because our yearly reviews are coming up and was like ""should I be worried"" she laughed it off and And said something to the effect of ""you of all people know that your have nothing to worry ""

My wife and I are moving from a small one bedroom to a nice 3 bedroom home in a few days with, granted half our savings being taken out for the payments, but still well within our financial means.

I always feel though that I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm waiting for me to get fired or reprimanded, or I'm waiting for something to go wrong with the house or I'm waiting for me to make a stupid financial decision. 

I understand there are things in life you can't control and that's part of living karma but when things are going so right… why am I so afraid something's going to go so wrong all the time?

 Granted the last few weeks have been a little hectic because we are waiting on funding for a work come up but we just got approved for it so we're good for a very long time.

I always 2nd guess myself, I'm always afraid of making a mistake or that something is about to blow but my face. I want to be able to relax and enjoy my life but it's like there's always that nagging headache in the back of my head even when I have nothing to worry about.

For those that might ask I do see a therapist and to be Frank with you I'm looking to change because she is in very helpful, and I am on medication taking an anti anxiety pill every morning and possibly a xanax in the afternoon depending on how I am.

Why am I this way? Why can I just enjoy my life?"
Anxiety,Weighted blankets,"Hi, I have trouble sleeping. I don't know if I'm depressed or anxious, but I feel really stressed. I have chest pains, my head burns and other symptoms that I can't remember right now.

Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my productivity,"I'm having a really hard time trying to motivate myself to do anything. I've always suffered with a bit of performance anxiety related to my education. Whilst at university, whenever we had our deadline period (end of each term/summer exam term) I would get so worked up about how much I have to do, how much I need to revise for, and how important it is that I would end up not getting anything done. The worry and stress just seems to take over, to the point where I can't concentrate and I lose interest in what I'm doing. Sometimes I will literally just sit there in my room and do nothing for HOURS, which sends me into a panic because I know I need to get stuff done, I just physically can't. Then I end up feeling guilty for not doing anything, and I do things to 'relax' but it's not relaxing in the slightest because the work I'm meant to be doing is constantly on my mind. 

I am currently in the last phase of my masters degree, I have 2 deadlines left and I just can't bring myself to do my work, AGAIN. I'm starting to fall behind because of how little I've done, and deadlines are getting closer by the day. Working from home is such a struggle because the environment I'm in is very distracting (because there's always loads of people in the house, including screaming kids, and obnoxious neighbours) but I can't get away because of lockdown. Normally I would be doing my work in the library on campus. 

I have no idea what to do anymore. I am a good student, I get high grades, and I get my work in on time MOSTLY, but stress and pressure f***s me up. I just want to finish my degree. I don't know how to motivate myself and just get it done. Any advice?"

Anxiety,Cant stop thinking anxious thoughts,"Hi reddit people 😃

I would love to hear differant peoples ways of keeping the anxious thoughts at bay.

I have the same anxious thought every time I have a fun night with friends where I think I have cheated.

It started 2 years ago and just keeps coming back after a night with friends where I might have had one to many glasses of wine.

I absolutely know in my heart I would never cheat and have spoke to therapists about it.

My fiance always tries to put my mind at ease by saying he was never alone in the night (my anxiety is I go to the bathroom and do something with the friend).

I am madly in love with my fiance and I think my anxiety comes from a place of I dont ever want to mess up what we have.

Any suggestions of distractions would be hugely appreciated.

Thank you!"
Anxiety,Depression is a welcome relief from anxiety,"Feeling more depressed than anxious today, and I'm oddly enjoying it. Even though I'm sobbing I'm also feeling relieved that I'm not having constant anxiety attacks all day so far."
Anxiety,Does anybody else find the sound of rain soothing?,"When it rains (as it is doing so now), I always love to turn off my lights and lie in bed listening to it hit the roof or pavement outside. I can recall as a kid, we had this family camp deep, deep into the woods- it was probably about a mile in, and no real road. Just a path created by my dad's truck. We would often get stuck in the mud, so mom would have my sister I grab our things, and we hiked our way into camp while my dad got the truck out of the mud.

This camp was the best- surrounded by forest, it was quiet, isolated. No electricity- we had to use oil lamps. No running water- my sister and I would have to run to the nearby creek and bring back 5 gallon buckets when we needed water.

It would rain sometimes when we were there and I always loved just lying on my bed, listening to the rain as it hit the tin roof.

I miss that place so much. I haven't been since the early/mid-90's. I recently asked my dad about going back, and he said others in the family took the camp over and sold some of the forest land. He says when you go there now, it looks nothing like it did in the 90s. All the forest and trees have been cut down and it's turned into a logging area.

Kinda breaks my heart... but at least I have the memories. And the falling rain reminds me of those wonderful memories. But the sound too is just so relaxing and soothing."
Anxiety,My anxiety makes me take on controlling tendencies in my relationship,"(F/22)

I’ve grown up with mentally/ emotionally abusive parents that belittled me and put me through traumatic experiences. It made me feel powerless and scared, it also led to me being depressed and suicidal up until I was 20. Due to my past experiences, I’m always trying to be in control / predict everything because my childhood was utter chaos and I don’t want to experience that again. I’ve been deeply hurt by loved ones and I’m scared to get hurt again. I also have trouble trusting people and find myself constantly needing to be in control. 

Those fears, insecurities, anxiety, and trauma are affecting my relationship and I’m not sure how to stop myself from being controlling and toxic. I get anxious about my bf not being honest or betraying me and it drives me crazy. I know he loves me and a part of me knows he would never cheat on me, but he’s lied and hid things from me before so it’s made it harder for me to trust him. As a result my anxiety has gotten worse and I find myself trying to keep him from talking or hanging out with girls he’s not close to because I’m scared and insecure I guess. I also find myself being overly clingy and needy - maybe from being neglected from parents, but my bf has a hard time understanding and is bothered by it. I hate how I feel / act and I want to change but idk how. 

I went to therapy for a little before covid but haven’t been able to go since. If anyone can shed light on how to move forward or send helpful links, that would be awesome. Thank you and I hope whoever comes across this post has a great day!"
Anxiety,Anxiety is worse than depression?,"I don't know if anxiety is worse than depression at some extent. You don't wanna die, but you can't sleep. With depression you wanna die, but have insomnia or hypersomnia.

There are panic attacks in anxiety and a lot of physical and psychological pain, but in depression you don't want talk to anybody and have a lot of psychological pain.

What do you guys think? Is depression less horrible than anxiety? For me both are bad, but I'd rather have depression."
Anxiety,Can I get some help?,"Ever since my step father died, a lot of the issues I have just been on my mind. He’s been gone for about two weeks 

1. His lost is just hard in general 
2. I’m starting to fall for my best friend, but I feel like I have no chance 
3. I’ve been trying to lose weight, with little results 
4. My dad and mom pointed out a lot of things wrong with me. (That one is a little complicated)
5. I don’t even know what my future is gonna be

Anxiety,Anxiety whenever I'm driving.,I have been driving for over 2 years and this problem only started this year I think. Whenever I'm driving and do anything like overtake a cyclist or any type of maneuver my mind starts telling me that I did it wrong (even if I did it fine and nothing bad happened) and then I think what if someone recorded me and sends it off to the police. I worry that I'm going to lose my licence even though I know that I haven't done anything wrong.

Anxiety,Anxiety or Health issue,"Hi friends. I’m new to this group but not new to anxiety. I have walked a find line of anxiety for 6 years now. Last year i went through a terrible time and got diagnosed with panic disorder on top of my anxiety/depression. I’m familiar with mild panic attacks as i used to have them once a day for 7 months but they were manageable. 
The past three days in a small of a sudden moment i got hot, light headed, and my heart was racing. This morning i woke up to my heart racing, and feel like i can’t breathe. I know these are tell signs of a panic attack and i also am a hypochondriac so i can convince myself of any disease. I don’t know if this is serious or just my anxiety. and do y’all have any tips? i used to take meds but i got off of it when my symptoms were controllable, i already go to therapy but it’s not until next week and this is happening now. I have a constant fear of dying, so i just want some options."
Anxiety,Do you ever ACTUALLY have fun?,"About 2 years ago I was asked by a friend

""When's the last time you let loose"" (he shook his body around and laughed)

Since then I've really thought about it and I just never have. Actively tried to let loose more but it doesn't work like that.

I never really have fun when I go out, there will be some enjoyable moments sometimes, but I never really enjoy myself the way I perceive others actually having a good time &amp; not worried about anything.

Drinking more doesn't really help, I end up nervous drinking and my anxiety will keep me coherent until I pass out. I find it best to limit alcohol intake.

Does anyone think a situational anxiety med would help with this?

I've overcame almost every other aspect of anxiety independently but just can't find a way to have fun in social situations.

Input/experiences welcome.

Thanks for reading."
Anxiety,"Finally worked up the courage to get a script. But worried of the change i will see in myself, and that is the last thing stopping me.","I have a pretty bad fear of taking medication. But I'm at the point where I have gotten sick of ruining relationships and creating issues that don't exist because my brain can't comprehend that everything is okay. I am also sick of hating all the music I've created the last 8 years to the point where it exhausts me to try now.

I finally mustered up the courage to go get a prescription written. I got a prescription written for Zoloft and would start that basically once I pick it up. However I'm at my wit's end. I wondered what would happen to my creativity, analytical skills, ability to appreciate beauty, and strong work ethic. The way my psychologist has made it out to be, seems unrealistic, and contrary to what I've read about people's experience: he says you'll be the same person without the worry. I read people not experiencing lows but also no more highs as a result. And I worry for myself and the way I will change, I worry about if I will ever accomplish as much as I used to if I'm happier, and I will be like ""my music sucks and I'm doing really poorly this semester, but it's okay, I'm happy"". I worry that I won't enjoy and experience even listening to music the same way again. 

I don't know what to do. It feels like in the end I have to lose no matter what."
Anxiety,Feel trapped inside my body,"I've been handling this pandemic as well as can be expected. Yes, I've been anxious but nothing I can't handle.

But two days ago, I suffered from a series of panic attacks over a 4-5 hour period which I've never had before, and I haven't really felt the same since. I don't know what triggered them, but I was very scared, to the point where I almost had my boyfriend take me to the hospital. I thought I was going to be in a constant state of panic and never feel normal again.

And ever since then, I feel like I'm trapped inside my body. Like my head is carrying my brain around. I've tried staying off my phone, I've tried laying down, I've tried going for walks. But the feeling always comes back.

I'm not sure if this is a symptom of the cold I've been fighting off or if it's some underlying anxiety problem. But I'm very uncomfortable. I want to get back to normal so I can be a better mom to my child, but I don't know where to start.

Has anyone experienced this? Do you have any advice to help me get through this?"
Anxiety,"I can’t breathe, I’m suffocating.","I’m so tired of my anxiety. I’m not sure how much longer I can live like this. It’s an everyday occurrence and it never goes away, and 99% I don’t even know what I’m having anxiety about. Some days it’s a little lighter, but most days it’s so severe that my chest feels so heavy and I can’t breathe, and it doesn’t stop until I go to sleep. I take CBD oil daily, I eat CBD gummies, I’m on anxiety meds. But nothing makes it go away.

Right now, I have absolutely nothing to be anxious about, yet I still can’t catch my breath and I have these uncomfortable waves in my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can take this, I’m just so tired of it never getting better. It’s taken over my life, it’s literally smothering me, I cannot breathe. I’m not even suicidal, but it makes me wish I were dead sometimes. I don’t even wanna be awake or alive most days because I don’t wanna feel this way the rest of my life. I can’t even catch a break from it and oh my god I can’t breathe. Please help me."
Anxiety,What is wrong with me ? (trigger warning)," I developed a sort of a mental fixation on a dude Ive seen once in my   entire lifetime one year ago and I've been fantasizing of having sex   with (the idea of) him everyday for the last year, often as intrusive   thoughts. I even finalized the break up with my boyfriend at the time,   just because of the attraction I felt for that random dude that I've   seen once (it was 100% not reciprocal though LOL). My intrusive thoughts   are always sexual btw. Before that I had a mental fixation with an  ex's  girlfriend , I would cyber stalk the living hell out of her on   instagram for almost a year and I stopped once they broke up. And now   I'm struggling to stop myself from cyber-stalking this dude, and   everything he posts triggers inexplicable jealousy in me. Also I haven't   got laid in over a year and I'm beyond frustrated abt it . WHAT IS   WRONG WITH ME ? Is this OCD ? I've been diagnosed with anxiety and  depression, but I  still don't know why I create THE same delusional  scenarios in my head  everyday of my life (they're the first thing I  think of once I wake up  in the morning), my head is driving me insane ,  I cannot seem to be able  to fix it, it seems like EVERYTHING triggers  me ... Please HELP ."
Anxiety,Question,Does every person with anxiety have trouble sleeping?
Anxiety,Anxious about death and living my life,"Hi everyone! So I've been dealing with a sort of existential crisis for the past 2 months. At its worst I was throwing up every day and not eating for around 3 weeks. I am already on antianxiety medication and was prescribed lorazepam for panic attacks. We are currently looking for a therapist to talk this out. 

I think it started when I graduated high school, we got the times to recent our diploma (corona had graduation be weird) I just couldn't shake the thought that I am going to die, my family is going to die, and that's for eternity. The idea of eternity and all freaks me out. One day while driving I looked up at the sky and started having a panic attack. I stayed inside for several weeks just so I wouldnt have to contemplate space. 

 I was raised catholic but my parents are super laid back so I have room to doubt my beliefs and when talking about it with my mom she said she shares the same doubts. 

I have been talking to a priest at my church, we discuss philosophy and science and how it fits with religion but I can't help thinking that its wishful thinking. There is a part of my that constantly doubts. I have an entire notebook full of arguments refuting my doubts yet I still struggle. 

Now I cant stop thinking that this is my only life and I am worried I will mess it up somehow or I wont get to accomplish all that I want and that terrifies me. I want to live a good life but I am so scared I'll be 80 and regret the choices I've made. 

I desperately want to believe in something after, especially not for my own death but my family. I am incredibly close to my maternal grandparents and parents and am afraid of losing them. 

I cannot stop thinking about this, its lead to me being incredibly nihilistic, I have the sensation of being in a movie, that nothing is real, and I think about it constantly and question everything. Please anything you can say, books, videos that would be useful?"
Anxiety,"Severe anxiety from chain smoking weed kept hunting me, my mind is wired to certain chain of thoughts, no day passes without me getting severely anxious.","I've tried meditation and it helps, also took a few MDMA pills that helped me temporarily.

Anxiety,In danger of loosing my job,"Hello! 

I'm kinda at a loss and don't know who else to turn to so I wanted to come here and ask for advice.  My anxiety is killing me with work and I'm in danger of loosing my job. I work for a Internet/cable/phone company and working from home do the pandemic.  For some reason for the last few months or so I can hardly work a half a day before my mind is telling me that I can't do it and end up calling off for the rest of the day, and i'm working from home.   I fully don't understand it and this might end up as me rambling.  I've done the job and very well at it. I do tech support.   I haven't realized or seen a trigger just start working then all of a sudden its like a flick of a switch I'm just feeling so drained and just feel like I can't do it. Usually call off then play video games to try and keep my mind occupied.  

Does anyone have anything like this happen?  I'm starting to write my schedule on a sticky note now to try and get in the midset of ""All i need to do is make it to 2:45 then I have a 30 min lunch"" rather then dreading the whole day.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Sorry i'm just at a loss and dont know what to do.  I'm diagnosed with Severe generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. Talked with my psyc and sounds like he wants to try mood stabilizers soon, and possibly get me off lexapro to something else.

Thanks for any advice"
Anxiety,Panic attack,"I am currently trying to calm down from a panic attack. I’m trying to figure out what could have caused it. I noticed right before I had it I was in a big argument with my brother and he ended up like running right past me and I guess I thought he was going to hit me. 


Growing up he would always like hit and punch and kick me but I don’t think it’s normal to flinch whenever near your sibling. Or be thrown into a panic attack when they get kinda close to you. Does anyone know what this could be? Or how to help it?

 As I’m calm I’m calming down I’m fearing going back downstairs. Whenever I told my parents how I felt they would just be like “oh well your siblings so that’s normal” or like “you guys fight each other all the time”. If anyone has any tips or information or can relate that would make me feel a lot better.

Sum: Brother got close to me- sent me in panic attack."
Anxiety,Getting extremely anxious and worried about a tattoo I am getting in three days.,So I am getting a tattoo on my outer lower leg that holds a lot of personal meaning to me.  I was meant to get this tattoo a few years ago but I chickened out and have felt so disappointed for it. I booked this tattoo two weeks ago and I am feeling my fight or flight response going crazy.  Anyone have a similar experience? Also I feel like I’m gonna make a fool of myself and pass out due to my body going crazy.
Anxiety,Vulnerability Causing Anxiety,I shared my life goals with someone and now I feel anxious. Is this a thing?
Anxiety,"Ah, it's just another depressing week with no achievement.","I'm frustrated at myself for not being able to anything. Not even the smallest thing neither can I get serious about it. It's like my attitude is already set to give up before even trying. I'm disappointed. I'm scared. I'm anxious. Why can't I achieve anything at all?

Anxiety,Do I panic too much?,"I had like 3 chest pains, my head burned and I was generally panicking all the time.

Is this too much?"
Anxiety,Anxiety induced cough or something else?,"I'm curious for those who may experience similar, but a cough that is off and on when I'm awake, but doesn't seem to happen at night, when I'm asleep.

A little background, I did develop a weird cough with chest tickle when I breathed in, early in Coronavirus days when Washington (where I reside) was still first in cases of the virus for the US.  I learned around that time my stress and anxiety do also cause me to run a low grade fever and due to exposure of the virus at my work place at the time, I got a test, which was negative.  It took a few days but the cough did go away.

Fast forward to this last month.  I'm in Oregon assisting with a business move.  It is my friends business and they're relocation is on the coast in a county with very low case count.  I believe at 16 as of now.  Unfortunately I have had a bit more contact with people here though always wearing a mask, even outside unless there is no one.  Due to a helper coming in who works in a pharmacy, I did go get tested again after she left as I again developed a cough and fever.  It came back negative.

This was a couple weeks ago.  I have had even less exposure with people due to fear, minus one person a couple of days ago who had been on a flight.  He wore a mask as did I and everyone else.  

I'm due to leave back to Seattle today but live with a roommate and worry about potential exposure for him.  My cough came back complete with tickle and a bit of tightness in the neck and chest.  I know my body is a bit out of whack from moving thousands of pounds of heavy boxes and stuff, which has improved but I'm curious if this cough could be again, somatic or if it is something else.

I know I'm in a low risk area and am prone to anxiety.  I haven't had a fever at all since the last test.  Minus the cough, tickle, and tightness I don't seem to have anything else and it doesn't bother me that I know of, when I'm sleeping.  I do worry a lot, I've been staying at the store which is indoors and with my friends I'm helping move.  They are okay but again, it's on my mind constantly.  The weird part about it this time is that I don't feel anxious.  I am worried but do not have the same feeling I usually do.

I have had some severe stress and a lot of loss these last five years.  I am on verge of homelessness again as I do not qualify for anything.  Needless to say, there's a lot of stress.  

All that to say, does anyone or has anyone else had similar experiences?  It's always the tickle part that weirds me out and I have been thinking it feels like I do when I get a bit of a cold, it's bizarre.  I know bodies are weird, but man, this is NOT the time.  

Thanks for listening."
Anxiety,Ptsd or maybe just anxiety?,"When I was little about 5 years old, I would wake up in the middle of the night screaming and hallucinating and running around freaking out for hours. The next morning, however, I would either barely remember it or not remember doing it all..... this went on for years but became less frequent. It last happened when I was 14 and I am 19 now. However, I have recently been diagnosed with severe panic disorder after going off birth control. My psychiatrist thinks that I have ptsd from a traumatic experience that happened to me when I was around 5 when the night terrors started. (Probably parents divorce at 5). And that the birth control exacerbated the trauma and made it resurface. But the divorce never really bothered me and still doesn’t? Could I have suppressed the traumatic experience or does anyone else have any advice or thoughts about the terrors or not why I have gone through?"

Anxiety,My 70 yo Dads Prostate results and my derm appointment on Monday,"When it rains it pours; that being said my Dad has an 830 call from the doctor to discuss his lab results. He has a prostate exam where his numbers were through the roof. (Like ‘10-12’ is bad and he had ‘26’). Both my parents are cancer survivors in the past and over the last few years my fil died from an aggressive cancer as well.


On top of that, I expedited my dermatology appointment.  I have a dark mole with a red ring around it on my leg.  Then I wake up this morning and notice smaller similar ones on my arm.  Health like most of us, gives me extreme anxiety.  Anyways I am just venting.  Would be cool to just enjoy a nice warm weather day, without bizarre crap popping up.

Anxiety,Phobias are weird,"I've had emetaphobia for years (phobia of barfing).  At one point in my life, I'd rather be hit by a car than throw up. Do you know what is more likely to kill you; being hit by a car! Do you know what is just kinda gross and unpleasant; puking!

Anxiety,I hate my health anxiety,"(F19) Now with everything going on in the world I’ve been sitting so much since school is online. About a month ago I was sitting and stressing about something so much that my low back started to ache (plus I have bad anxiety so my body “shakes” a little) the ache then radiated down to my legs and I haven’t been the same since. I get pain behind my thigh, calf, and on my foot too sometimes it’s a sharp pain or sometimes it’s an achey feeling. My toes, and sometimes my leg too, frequently have a pins and needle feeling and I get random twitches throughout my leg. I’ve noticed that when I lay on the side of my unaffected leg (left) and then raise my right leg, my leg will reach a certain point in the air where it started to shake a little or feel weak, especially in the side of my glute

I have bad health anxiety so of course I googled and saw the result of a dvt and got really paranoid. I have no swelling or discoloration but I went to my doctor and she checked my circulation and said it was perfect. She didn’t order a d-dimer though. She did that leg raise test on me but I didn’t have a shooting pain down the back of my leg, it just made my foot tingle. She’s not sure, but she said I may not have full blown sciatica but maybe some extent of it or maybe I tweaked a nerve somehow? I think the pain started to subside a few days after... 

However, this week everything came back, I have pins and needles in my foot, twitches throughout my leg, and my calf kind of feels tight as well as the front side of my thigh when I bend my leg behind me and hold my foot. If I stand straight up and bend my leg behind me without grabbing my foot, my leg feels weak and shakes a little and my calf just feels weird. Since I never had a d-dimer, I’m trying to rationalize hypochondriac me and tell myself it’s not a clot but I’m still worried. Does this sound anything at all like sciatica or a nerve pain? Do you think its possible to have a mild case of it? My dvt fears are literally consuming my life for this past month and I’ve been trying so hard to tell myself it’s just nothing."

Anxiety,Despair from memory lapse,"Was telling a story to my girlfriend just earlier today. Then I completely forgot it in the middle. I tried not to show it, but I kinda got in despair, thinking I was having some brain-related attack (convulsion, stroke etc.). I measured 127 heart beats per minute. Then I calmed down and remembered  it, finished the story. Strange situation.

Has anyone undergone through that? I don't if the fact that I'm a concerned person about brain-related issues makes something like that be even worse, distracting me."
Anxiety,Is it okay to use stim toys to help w/anxiety w/out being autistic?,"I’m a 23 y/o female, first time posting really anything on reddit but felt like I needed to get this off my chest and just out of my busy brain. Sorry for how messy and long winded this will probably be. 

Since I was little I always needed something to keep my hands busy or something to do in order to stay focused. That translated to biting or picking at my nails, then biting the sides, something I’ve gotten better at avoiding but I haven’t been able to grow out of chewing and picking at my lips or biting at the inside of my cheeks. Later I would be told this was early signs of social anxiety and potentially depression, both which were professionally diagnosed in my mid teens. 

The only time I’ve ever really stopped the picking and biting was when I was smoking- something I quit about a year and a half ago (because it’s gross) but after quitting I feel like the picking and biting got worse now that I didn’t have something to do with my hands or something to keep my mouth busy without talking. 

So I invested in a fidget cube which was nice but hard to have out at work or when driving, then a fidget ring made out of 3 loops that I feel only works for a few minutes at a time, still it’s something to keep my hands busy, but I don’t have anything to keep my mouth busy. 

Recently I’ve learned what stim toys are and what they’re used for. As someone with a little brother on the autistic spectrum, I understand how important having positive stimulation can be and have found myself gravitating toward them as well. 

The only problem is I feel weird, looking into chew stim toys and chew necklaces. I guess some weird part of me feels like I’m potentially taking away resources for someone actually on the spectrum, I guess similar to the whole fidget spinner debacle a few years back.

TL;DR I have anxiety and depression, constantly feel the need to keep my hands and mouth busy, have been looking into stim chew toys, but feel weird potentially taking away resources from someone actually on the autistic spectrum, please help."

Anxiety,Anyone else experiencing memory issues?,"Family and friends talk about things like: hey remember that time in high school, or remember when we did this and that, and all I have are very vague memories of certain things? I've heard that anxiety and depression aren't really directly related to memory problems, and this made me feel even worse because why do I have such a poor memory? And I'm too young to have Alzheimer's(25). I am so anxious in situations where people talk about smth I just don't remember about. They look at me like what's wrong with you. Is it really possible that I was just oblivious with everything and didn't pay attention to anything? Because if that's the case I really am suffering some serious consequences. Anyone with the same issues?"
Anxiety,When to take Seroquel if I need to wake up for work at around 5:00 am every day?,"Hi,

I have GAD and mild obsessive thoughts so in addition to my anti-depressants my psychiatrist prescribed 25 mg of  Seroquel to take every night at 21:00. However, since I know that this drug makes people exhausted shouldn't I take it before 21:00?

Anxiety,I'm living alone. Am on vacation with my family and friends. How can I avoid falling into that hole when I'm all alone again?,"I am sorry if this is the wrong sub or whatever, but I guess it is related to anxiety.
Context: One year ago I (22m) had to move out from my parent's home because work required me to move some 300 miles away. I had a hard time adapting with no friends and knowing nobody.

For the first time this year due to corona (germany, so corona has gotten better), I am visiting my parents, spending time with them, with my brother, and with my friends from High School that I also consider family. This vacation lasts 5 weeks.

So for 6 Months I was all alone all the time, and was used to it. Now with my vacation coming to and end, how can I avoid falling into the hole that awaits me, now that I am socializing so much at my parents' when I am back to being alone?

I am crying right now and afraid of being alone. Monday is when I have to return home."
Anxiety,I can’t stop obsessing over this tiny incident,"Some background: I am an 18F, and I have been dating my bf for around 3.5 years. I love him very much and have no doubts that I want to be with him. 

At the beginning of the summer, I started working at a large grocery store where my job is to fulfil online orders. I often work early in the morning, which means my shift usually overlaps with the late night stockers. 

About a week ago I was shopping for some items and one of the stockers helped me get something on a high shelf. He then started asking me some basic small talk questions (which is a side tangent but I am not the best at social interactions). This is pretty normal because there are a lot of employees and people are generally pretty friendly. The convo ends, I leave to keep working and then he suddenly comes back and asks me for my number. Inside I freak out and outside I say “I have a boyfriend.” And then I follow up with “and I’m 18 so too young” (I have no idea how old he was but he looked around 24). I guess I blanked on the fact that where I live, 18 is old enough to date anyone older than you. 

I know this seems like a very basic interaction but it has been a week and I cannot stop being overwhelmed by this. I go out of my way to avoid this guy at work, I replay the exchange over and over in my head, I can’t even talk about it out loud with anyone. Today I accidentally made eye contact with him and I almost threw up. I don’t know how to make this stop. This has made me so anxious and uncomfortable at work, even though nothing bad technically happened."

Anxiety,Does anyone else struggle with leaving social gatherings?,"Although I don't like categorizing personalities, I would consider myself a social introvert or ambivert. I usually have no problems with making plans and meeting up with people, even if it's just to hang out at their place.
 
But I really struggle with announcing that I'm leaving. I have this sort of barrier in my head, that prevents me from straight up just saying ""aight, imma head out"".  
  
I think it's because I'm overthinking when it's appropriate to leave or not. 

This sometimes leads to me staying there like half an hour longer than I wanted to and it's really annoying.

Not really looking for advice, just want to know I'm not alone lmao"
Anxiety,About to take a bong rip... wish me luck.,"Weed has always helped me with anxiety but in the past few months it's been very hit or miss. Either it calms me or causes me to dissociate.

Anxiety,Manual/Conscious Breathing Woes,"hello, not sure if i'm allowed to post here since i technically have not been diagnosed with anxiety by a doctor, so please let me know if my post would be a better fit elsewhere (:

so about 3 weeks ago i had about 2 episodes of sudden shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat and slight lightheadedness, both after drinking dark black coffee. the first doctor i went to told me it might have been anxiety, which i thought was odd because i really wasn't feeling particularly stressed over anything at that point in time, but looking back, i realized that the lockdown in my country and not going out much for more than a month made me very listless, antisocial and i had a loss of appetite, plus i was preparing to start my internship a week later, and perhaps all of this compounded and gave rise to my first experience with anxiety.

the second doctor i visited suggested it could be acid reflux/gastric problems and gave me medication for it, following which i started to get symptoms like bloatedness, sore throat, globus etc. these symptoms don't really bother me that much anymore (i actually don't even know if i had acid reflux problems in the first place).

what has really been troubling me is that for the last 3 weeks i've been engaging in manual/conscious breathing (if i've used the terms correctly). frequently throughout the day, i will start to notice my breathing and then randomly feel my chest becoming slightly tight, and i end up having to make a conscious effort to breathe and if i don't, then i really don't breathe. this is probably also bc of how my nose is kind of stuffy at the moment. i considered that this might be a result of a medical condition but i am able to sleep pretty decently at night for hours at a go, so i think the barrier is really trying to psychologically control my breathing enough to relax and fall asleep.

i'm really new to this whole experience of manual breathing and it's been making me very anxious about my health and my mental state as well. i don't know how long it will go on but i really want to learn to cope with it and get a hold of my life. i would be really grateful if anyone has any tips on how they cope with this, or maybe just share their own stories and experiences so i don't feel so afraid and alone in this. 

thank you so much!"
Anxiety,Has anyone ever told u this?,"I suffer from severe anxiety and just recently had a severe panic attack that put me in the hospital. My parents, especially my mom, knows that I worry a lot, but dosn’t want to see that it’s anxiety not just some stupid worrying. I sorta said in slight detail that I worry a lot and can’t control it to my mom But has your mom or anyone close to you ever told u “just don’t worry then and nothing will happen,” “stop overthinking your just making yourself worse and u obviously don’t want to help yourself.” Like anxiety isn’t just something u can tell to fucking go away. Anxiety is a damn mental health issue that people get wether they like it or not and people grow to help deal with it. There is medication, therapy, breathing exercises and more to help people with anxiety and I would do anything just to get a pill to take or something very time I start to worry because it affects everything, my eating, my sleep, my production. My mom just dosn’t understand and dosn’t want to see that I’m struggling with anxiety and it ruins me. Instead, her comforting words are “stop acting like this and worrying so much or doctors will think your psychotic and you’ll be put on mental medication.” :,) Again, Anxiety is not something u can tell to fuck off and ur problems will just be solved."
Anxiety,Acne from anxiety,"I’ve never struggled with acne before (except a few blemishes here and there), but since the pandemic, I have had a noticeable increase in acne that hasn’t stopped.

Has anyone else struggled with this??

I’ve definitely been highly anxious before, but maybe it’s because I’m in a very constant state of heightened worry?"
Anxiety,Enjoy the moment ? How,"When I tell my friends that I worry about the future and that I worry about what worse could happen, people tend to tell that I have to live in the present but how am I supposed to do ? Whenever I try to relax and all, my anxious and negatives thoughts pop up in my head."
Anxiety,What are some of the best ways to deal with health related anxiety?,"Ive only had strong symptoms of anxiety for a couple of weeks now and I'm seeing a therapist for it. Every small bout of pain in a random part of my body causes me to think I'm going to drop dead at any moment. I Google my symptoms every chance I get which I know doesn't help at all, and even makes my anxiety worse, but I can't stop. I'm getting a few medical tests done sometime this week or next week just to help me get my mind off things.

My primary fear is having a health condition that went undiagnosed for years which could kill me at any time, even though I have no evidence for this. I've never even had any serious health problems. I can admit I don't activity try to be healthy - I'm a bit overweight, don't eat very well, tend to skip meals quite a lot, and don't exercise as much as I should.

People who have been in similar situations and have managed to overcome it, what did you do?"
Anxiety,A THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU,"I just want to extend my gratitude to everyone who helped me through intense suicidal thoughts and severe anxiety tonight. I did not want to live a couple hours ago, now I have hope. From the bottom of my fucking heart thank you so FUCKING MUCH. From good advice to funny conversations, this made my mood do a 180. I really really really cant thank you guys enough."
Anxiety,I just finished a month of being on a heart monitor because I convinced my doctor I might have heart problems.,"I’m 38, obese and have a family history of heart problems.  Over the past year I have convinced myself that I have AFib or something like it because of certain feelings I’ve experienced in my chest.

He put me on a heart monitor for a month and guess what?  Nothing.  Perfectly normal, no issues detected whatsoever.  I’m relieved and feel slightly embarrassed.  My doctor is very cool though.  He knows I suffer from anxiety and we’ve found the right medication to address it, but he really had a heart to heart with me (no pun intended).  He said I still have time to start eating right and exercising before my obesity starts to lead to serious complications.  My blood pressure is good, I’m not pre-diabetic yet and I’m relatively healthy for an obese 38 year-old.  But when it starts to go downhill, it usually does so rapidly one problem after another.  He did a great job of comforting me, encouraging me and scaring the shit out of me all at the same time and I needed all 3."
Anxiety,Tips for crisis?,[deleted]
Anxiety,Do you guys have a dramatic imagination?,"Like i watched a tiktok of guy grabbing his friend by the neck (like hugging it) and jumping into a pool with him. My first thought was ""What if chokes and dies?"" Then ""what if he hits his head at the bottom and breaks his neck"" then finally it was ""what if his friend goes psycho and strangles him???"" This made me excited/anxious. Like how before a scary scene from a horror movie you get excited by the possibilities. But it also made me anxious cause i didnt want it to happen, and scared it might happen.

Anybody else?"
Anxiety,Tips against exam anxiety,"Hi, 

Everytime I have exams at university, I have this irrational anxiety that is absolutely wrecking me. I am currently going through an exam period and in 3 weeks, I have barely slept or eat, I lost 6kg (from 70 to 64kg) and this while on Venlafaxine 75mg and Xanax 1mg. I have also tried cognitive behavioral therapy but it keeps coming back. I really don’t know where it is coming from because I have been performing very well and I am currently in my fifth and last year. Although I want to find a solution because I will still have exams when I’m admitted to the bar. Has anyone tips against this kind of anxiety?

Thanks in advance!"

Anxiety,Meds aren’t everything.,"Meds don’t fix the world

Had my first panic attack after starting meds 4 weeks ago due to drinking that pesky caffeine at 6pm hehe. I knew this day would come where I felt anxious once again, but I totally forgot the feeling that I let it get to me. 

Just a note to everyone that’s meds aren’t everything, but it can get us to a place where we feel like ourselves again. Don’t be afraid. We will overcome this and learn to use our anxiety to our advantage. Another anxiety attack or panic attack will come for me, but like before, it will pass, and we’ll continue to live the life that we love living :) 

Oh and PS, if you are contemplating meds, please do give it a try. Especially now thru the heightened feels from BLM, police brutality, and disease, right now is the best time to give your mind and body that extra help to cope and accept."

Anxiety,My husband wants us to get covid-19,"My husband has been careful until now. We were looking after my vulnerable sister for the first 9 weeks of lockdown but now she's gone home he sees no reason to be as careful.


I wear a mask whenever I have to enter a building, use hand sanitiser when I can't wash my hands etc, but he's started to skip the sanitiser and doesn't care if he touches his face. He's not going out of his way to get it but keeps telling me we should just get it over with so we have the antibodies.


Here in the UK there's a lot of talk that our government's strategy is 'herd immunity' over time and that up to 80% of the country will get it eventually. We are in our mid-30s and only have a 0.08% risk of dying from covid-19, and with no health issues of any kind it may be even less than that. He thinks I'm being overly cautious but the truth is that I'm more afraid of my anxiety if I get it. I'm terrified of having a panic attack due to my hypochondria, not being able to breathe and in turn believe that I'm dying. I hear about people that have recovered or where asymptomatic and still had a heart attack, so I KNOW that would pray on my mind for the entire time I had it and after the fact.


How can I explain to him that I'm so upset by his willingness to put me in that position?"
Anxiety,Sleep and Anxiety,"Hello fellow anxiety induced friends. I just wanted to share thoughts with this community after reading some other comfortable post to get some steady advice and help. I think I have insomnia and Anxiety. Every time I attempt to sleep, it’s so difficult. I feel alone and my brain wanders to thoughts of death and seeing my loved ones die. It’s terrifying but I can’t seem to shake it when I sleep alone. I sleep otp with my s/o every night but when he falls asleep first, I can’t sleep. My brain drifts and i can’t keep my eyes closed because i start to panic. It’s currently 6:26 AM and i haven’t slept all night. This isn’t the first night i’ve gone without sleeping either. Every night it’s something new. On nights when i’m with him, it’s generally easier to sleep (unless he falls asleep first.) Being alone with my thoughts has been very damaging and I feel like i’m losing my mind. I’m sleep deprived, anxious a lot of the time and quarantine has been driving me mad. I have a therapist but these otp sessions haven’t been at all helpful to my mental state for some reason. I try meditation and i’ve used all sorts of relaxation methods. Is my only next step medication ? I don’t want it to be but i’m at a loss for ideas. Thanks for those who read and wish me luck."

Anxiety,first time on anxiety meds,"I took half of one of my dad's anxiety pills before taking an online oral test with the teacher I am most terrified of and I am happy to say it went really well. The meds suppressed my pre-test jitters (aka my shaking hands and the difficulty breathing). During the test I could still feel my heart pound and I was still a bit scared to give the answer, but it went well. 

All in all, I am really proud of myself."
Anxiety,Anxiety ordering things at a restaurant,"I think the moral of this story is if you have anxiety, it's better to order online and pick up. 

Many places I pick up lunch from are a little hectic and have a lot of people on their lunch rush. 

After I order I wait patiently for my name to be called, but because there are so many people pushing and asking where their orders are, the order in which the food comes out jumps around.

After I saw two girls who were behind me get their dishes after complaining, I asked where my food was. They said it was coming and after they served the orders to the other people that were in line behind me I asked for my money back.

They were very sorry and said it would be ready in 10 minutes, but I had no power to wait and already decided that lunch was not going to happen for me today.

I know I'm in the wrong. I know I should have waited or pushed more to get my food. I know these are 1st world problems. 

These feelings of anxiety that I have when I'm out in public is only more real now that I need to go back to work. I feel like I can't go outside without having some sort of issue. Losing my f'ing mind"

Anxiety,Moment of weakness leaves me with 5 weeks of misery,"Hey anyone reading this, im dan and i have been battling depression and anxiety for over 12 years. Ive been having a really rough time lately and have been fighting with my wife which never happens. Long story short we exchanged frustrated words to which her response was to get in the car and drive away. I raced to the front door to stop her but she didnt see me. Everything came to a head at that point and i punched the wall as hard as i could. Unfortunately for me it hard plywood behind it. I called my wife who turned around and came home. After seeing my hand we sat down and talked about what was going on cause this was the worst its been.

Next day my hand was super swollen and bruised but not too painful so i just iced it. 5 days go by im still bruised but barely any pain. I thought my pinky was dislocated so i went to the doc, turns out i broke my knuckle now im stuck in a cast. I cant drive, use my comp to game, or hold a controller. 4 more weeks to go"

Anxiety,Help needed on how to deal with anxiety disorder when boyfriend is going on a trip for the first time,"In about a week my boyfriend is planning to go to a beach house together with some of his friends. They do that every year and it seems like their tradition. The house is about 40 minutes away from his home so not really a big travel. When he first told me about it he had messed up the dates and told me it would be in July but then he noticed his mistake and told me it's in june. When it was in july I didnt really feel bad about it probably because it still seemed so far away but now I'm being constantly worried. I have severe anxiety and my boyfriend and I haven't spent much time away from each other since we started dating about 8 months ago. I managed to figure out that I'm mostly scared of him getting in an accident or drinking too much/taking too much drugs. This is kinda a trauma I guess because my ex already used to cheat on me or threaten me badly when he drank. My boyfriend doesnt usually drink much but the last time he did he was trying to get an alcohol poisoning (luckily it didnt work) after we had had a big fight.

 Basically I'm very scared something will happen to him and that leads to me being very anxious about him going on that 5 daytrip. I've felt very strong anxiety since he told me it would be this month and I don't know what to do about it. I dont want to ask him to not go because it's their tradition but I also dont want to be anxious the whole time. What can I do?"

Anxiety,NEED HELP ASAP,"Hello,

I feel so strange posting here about this but I am really stuck and only have an hour to prepare. I have recently been suffering from stress anxiety, irritability, physical symptoms, obsessive need for cleaning etc..the list goes on, however, I don't have anxiety about going into public areas, etc but I do CONSTANTLY worry about everyday things. I have a GP appointment in an hour and I am really unsure what to do because I have anxiety but stress anxiety, I am worried about therapy as I don't really have time and have been doing little apps and anonymous call things, etc which has been similar to self-help therapy which has helped and also, I am extremely worried to go on any medication as I have weight issues and know SSRI's are common for weight gain which I think would bother me even more... I also don't know what else to do as my moods and anxiety/stress is affecting everyone around me so I have to go through with this appointment otherwise it isn't fair on my partner etc.. I am really worried about this, I'm sorry. I do really appreciate any help advice, for example, help to word my stress/anxiety, help with what medications are good etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much! I hope everyone is keeping well!"
Anxiety,TW:Abuse,"I spent from the age of 12 to the age of 18 being abused, from sexually to physically to mentally and emotionally. There's so much built up trauma that I don't know how to process it anymore so my brain turns it into anxiety and guilt for the littlest normal things. It keeps me up at night and it makes me wakeup in a panic. I feel like this terrible person even though I was the victim and I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm losing my sanity and no amount of reassurance helps."
Anxiety,Living in another country,"Hi there,
Has any of you started having anxiety when moving to another country where everything is new and you have to communicate with foreign language that you don’t feel 100% confident with? I moved to the UK from Poland over 3 years ago and I still can’t accommodate. In the last 2 years I’ve become very anxious and depressed and from very confident person I became very shy and scared of people. Any advice how to feel more comfortable or how to make friends when living abroad?"
Anxiety,Self sabotage,"I began working at a new job. It is amazing. Everything is well organised and run. It makes me nervous to just relax and sometimes sit and do nothing (because the work has already been done /planned). At my old job i would have to do so many things and i did so many peoples jobs for them (my fault but if i did not do it then there would have been more problems). The contrast is crazy. Im constantly nervous and i walk around asking people if there is anything i can do or help them with. But there is not because everyone's work is done. To just not have that type of pressure anymore or to just not have to deal with a horrible work environment is a blessing but i am really struggling to let my guard down. I know this will eventually go away on its own. But one thing is for sure: it is really highlighting how bad things were before so please, if you are not in a good work environment, and if possible, leave. Do it for you and your own wellbeing."
Anxiety,DAE feel stomach pain caused by anxiety or generally any digestive tract problems cause by anxiety?,"My anxiety seems to get the best of me these days.

Can't even visit my doctor because of this whole quarantine stuff, I'm too afraid to go out. I have a psychiatrist visit scheduled on 16th, and I'm thinking about cancelling just because I'm too scared to go outside. I know it's irrational but when your city gets 300+ new COVID-19 cases every day, and all you have is a DIY mask, things just... feel very serious. And if I cancel, I won't get my anxiety meds refill. Sick of this vicious circle."

Anxiety,Dealing with anxiety while out of work and school,"I’m out of work/school for 8 weeks and thought it would be great. I can finally read that stack of books, watch movies I’ve been wanting to see, etc. 

Instead, it’s been a mess. Financially, things are fine. I’m frugal and have more than enough funding. I talk to family and friends over the phone but it still doesn’t always help. 

I feel very anxious and think irrational thoughts (what if I made x mistakes in my past, what if someone is after me, etc.). It’s the worst between 11pm-6am. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. I don’t really know what to do, but I feel like I’m sabotaging myself and the only 8 weeks I’ve had to relax in the last 7 years. I know it’s partially my fault for investing my entire sense of purpose and energy into going to work and attending classes, but I just can’t get past the anxiety I’m experiencing."
Anxiety,Avoiding anxiety inducing information?,"I have a lot of anxiety about death and illness. I have food allergies so I think it is rooted in that. I'm always so picky about what i eat or how it looks in fear of cross contamination. But during the pandemic this has spread to being scared about illnesses too, like the virus. Additionally, my parents have always been INCREDIBLY paranoid about Lyme disease, i can never avoid hearing about it. It's gotten to the point where I just avoid doing anything in life. There's always something to be anxious about, and a lot of times some anxiety is justified, i don't know how much though. I just get too anxious about things. Would it be helpful to be ignorant about things like viruses and avoid info about them rather than constantly worry about them? I feel like I can't escape my anxiety."
Anxiety,Nothing works anymore,"Are any of you madly in love with someone, extremely committed and know 100% you’re going to marry that person but still feel incredibly empty and hopeless? I still feel this sense of loneliness and disconnect from everyone. 

I can’t tell if I have friends. Sure, people reply to my Instagram stories but they never ask how I’m going or if I want to catch up with them.

I know my family love me and support me. But they’d move on eventually if I died. Everyone does when someone dies.

I feel empty and distant from everyone I know. I can’t express how I feel to anyone verbally. Every time my partner asks why I’m so down I shut off and refuse to talk. It’s gotten to the point of if I wanted to tell her how I felt, the words can’t actually leave my mouth.

I hear the phrase “I just want to die” at least 10 times a day in my head. I’m so sick of this"
Anxiety,Anxiety and gagging,"I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for years. I can manage the depression because it's almost normal for me. The anxiety is new and in the past year or so it's become unmanageable.

I returned to work last September after being put on stress leave due to a mental breakdown. The day I went back to work, I started gagging and I couldnt stop. I work in a restaurant so it looks bad, I'm serving food and I'm gagging so hard I throw up sometimes. 

It only happens when I'm at work. The job itself isn't very stressful but the co workers and management makes it a toxic and abusive environment. I show up everyday and try my best to do a good job. The gagging only happens at work and it's becoming a distraction and my manager actually got a few complaints about it. Rightfully so, I wouldn't want someone serving food while gagging. 

I've tried to do it quietly or go out back. I've tried asking my doctor to look into the gagging but he didn't want to run any tests, and the only solution he has was for me to quit my job. I asked him for anti anxiety medication and he told me it wasn't that bad and that I didn't need it. 

I gave up and a few months later I got the courage to ask again, he told me no again but I wasn't leaving until I got something to deal with anxiety. He gave me 14 ativan and told me never to ask again because he will never prescribe it to me again.

In March I got laid off from my job due to Covid and the gagging stopped. I was feeling great I thought ""maybe it'll stop, maybe the gagging finally stopped""

But I returned to work last week and the gagging returned. Naturally I'm terrified to get a complaint, I'm scared I'm going to lose my job over something I cannot control.

So what I'm asking is does anyone else suffer from gagging due to anxiety? Is there anything I can do to make the gagging quieter or help keep it under control? 

TLDR: Having anxiety induced gagging, only happens at work. Doctor refuses to help or give medication for anxiety. Looking for ways to deal with gagging."

Any tips or suggestions to help me out here. 

I always get a feeling like something is about to go wrong. Even if I am working on something, I feel like this project/task will also fail. Everytime I hear the phone ring, I feel like it is some bad news and something horrible happened. I constantly feel like this throughout the day.

And if something good/bad happens I feel like I am not able to grasp it completely. It feels like the fear envelopes me. And at the same time, it is happening to somebody else. I am not able to feel it at the same time. This is sort of a banter. I hope somebody would be able to relate and assist me to overcome this feeling."

However, I’m scared I might be right about this and the doctor will probably prescribe medicine. I just wanna know how it effected your moods and behavior, and would you recommend it?"

Anxiety,Leaving a voicemail,"So before I called a local clinic for therapy and I spent like 2 hours preparing on what to say. When I finally worked up my courage to call the number it took me to an automatic message system and it said press 2 to leave a voicemail, change appt, etc, or press 1 for emergency. I pressed 2 and it said leave a name, number, reason for calling. I didnt think this far ahead and I hung up and spent another hour planning what to say. When I finally did it I felt so relieved it was over. 

UPDATE AHH. 5 minutes later they called back. I felt so anxious and nervous. But the lady was really nice so I got to send my information out and they will call me back sometime this week. This was a lot of courage built up but I’m really glad I did it."
Anxiety,Has anyone given up coffee and it helped?,"I hear it all the time that my coffee makes my anxiety worse but I feel sceptical because I've had anxiety issues longer than I've had a coffee addiction. I also don't feel like coffee wakes me up anymore its more for comfort but if I have 3 cups my hands shake. I feel like that's separate from my anxiety symptoms, like tight chest etc, and my hands have shaken from anxiety too but I think I can tell the source based on how I'm feeling overall.

Has anyone quit coffee and found their anxiety symptoms improved? I'd like to hear your experiences."

Anxiety,Anxiety after virus,"So I contracted a virus this feb while on a cruise.  Thank God I have recovered from the main symptoms of the virus, but it really threw me for a loop emotionally and mentally.  I have had lots of secondary symptoms ever since.  I am not sure of my body got depleted, but the stress was overwhelming and I developed insomnia the last month.

I have gone through bouts of anxiety before, but not long term where I needed to constantly be on medications.  My doctor prescribed low dose xanax .25 and ambien 10 mg.  I can now consistently get some amount of sleep with ambien, sometimes with 5-7.5 mg.  Once in a while i can fall asleep for 3 hours or so without it.  

So I've been using ambien rather consistently for a month but I'm worried about being dependent on medications to sleep.  Also makes me groggy and anxious the next day, and not feeling like myself.  I just want my sleep to return.  What is your experience with insomnia and these medications?  How to restore my sleep?"
Anxiety,Why do I get uptight about modelling?,"My mums friend owns a fancy dress shop and recently she wanted myself and my sisters to model clothes for her. For some context: In the past, I’ve been scouted my three agencies, and have attended their ‘bootcamps’ (where they train you). Of course I was excited, I love clothes and the whole process of getting my hair and makeup done, as well as meeting other girls. During these bootcamps however, I had the worst anxiety attacks, almost cried when doing a catwalk exercise, as well as failed to talk to any of the girls. I’m still signed with the agency, but after that bootcamp, I was the only girl to never receive further work. This really affected my self esteem, and to have later been scouted by another agency who said horrible things about my appearance, took what little esteem I had left. Now, every time a friend, my boyfriend or my family want to take a picture of me, I get really grumpy. In my head I think “I can pose and maybe look good”, but my mind goes straight to “one of your eyes always looks small, your forehead is large, your skin is disgusting”. I can’t explain in but I’m always close to a breakdown. I’m still comfortable posting selfies on social media but I never truly like them. I’ve had this lack of self esteem since my early teens, and I think a lot of it is a product of my anxiety. I hate to seem grumpy and rude when really I just hate myself. In my head I always think, you don’t deserve to have these pictures taken because that would seem overly narcissistic. If I ever try posing, I think, how stupid I must look to others to think I look good, because I don’t. Once lockdown is over I’m meant to be seeing my agency again, but my family don’t think there’s any point in me pursuing it, seeing how I fail at posing and such. It’s just such a shame since this was a thing I’ve always wanted to do, and I feel my long limbs are going to waste. In some ways, I feel it reclaims my femininity as a tall girl, as consistent bullying in my life has led me to believe I’m manly 

My mum still doesn’t recognise my anxiety as a mental illness, she was actually surprised when I explained to her that. She can be very disregarding when it comes to mental health, and I feel it makes things harder sometimes. My dad is even worse. Like today, I understand her frustration with me, but sometimes I just need to be sad. I can’t be happy always."
Anxiety,Anxiety has led to me being judgemental,"I've found myself this weekend being judgemental about a new co-worker I have who has a hard time with social cues. I'm really ashamed of myself but i want to use this time to try and figure out how I've ended up being such a villan. 

I think what's happened is that I'm extremely self critical, and i punish myself for when i contribute to a conversation and my comment isn't received well. People tell me that ""everybody's too worried about their own issues to judge you""  and that always feels weird o hear, because it's so easy to judge myself, and I think i've started a habit of judging other people, in order to feel like i'm not wrong for thinking people judge me as harshly. 

Anxiety makes me anxious, but I think i've created bad coping mechanisms around my anxiety, and i've realized that I'm being judgemental to other people in order to feel like other people are just as judgemental to me."

Anxiety,"I'm scared to take anti-anxiety medication, but sometimes I feel desperate for help.","Hello,

I apologize if the purpose of this post ends up feeling a bit unclear, maybe I should just say that what I'm asking for is some folks' opinions about starting anti-anxiety medication. For or against, I'd like to hear it - I'm not looking to validate anything I already believe. I'm asking for this because I'm sure like a lot of people here I've got a pretty bad anxiety disorder that causes me a lot of emotional and physical pain on a daily basis. 

I am a 33 year old male.

Almost a decade ago I went to a general practice doctor (which I later learned was a bad idea) for help and was put on Paxil, Buspar, and one other medication I can't remember. This ended up being a nightmare in many ways between side effects, a drastic change in my personality, and sending my risk tolerance through the roof. I engaged in a lot of irresponsible, risky behaviour that I look back on and feel very ashamed of.

After about a year I was able to wake up and get myself off of these medications. In the years following I resolved to deal with my problem without medication and made some very good progress. I have a successful career, I travel, and I have a partner that I love dearly and intend to marry. I began exercising regularly and got myself into fantastic shape, read self help books, pushed myself out of my comfort zone, and have a therapist I see weekly. I also started taking sleep seriously, and over the last year have been meditating semi regularly which has helped a good deal with some aspects of my problem. People who are not close friends with me generally have no idea that I struggle with this.

The problem is that it over the last 2-3 years my anxiety disorder seems to be getting worse, or maybe it would be more accurate to say that all those things I listed aren't having the effect they used to, and I feel like I am running out of ideas. I am scared all the time. There are days when I feel like crying all day, for no reason. Sleeping has become difficult, my brain refuses to stop and the sleep I do get is poor quality. I have panic attacks which I feel like I can say without question is the worst thing I've ever experienced. I procrastinate on important things because I just want to hide. 

But most important of all this makes my relationship suffer. I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world, and there is nothing more important to me than our relationship. I don't say this seeking praise, but I work *very* hard to be a good partner. Having a healthy relationship is the hardest and most fulfilling thing I've ever done. Yet this disorder makes me unavailable more than I'd like because of how often i disassociate. Working through relationship problems is that much harder and causes her to take on more of her fair share of the burden because of how much conflict ramps up my anxiety. I just want to be a good partner.

To return back to the start of this post I just wonder if anyone can share their stories of going on medication. Has anyone ever had a bad experience and then tried again and had a good experience with it? Does it scare anyone else to be so dependant on something? I worry if I get on and then want off I can't turn back, or it will make me do something stupid again. Has anyone else had these fears?

Thank you"

Anxiety,"Lost job, unemployment, and terrified.","Hey everyone. So I had a job for 2 years. Loved it, it was easy. Nothing too hard. The place closed in March due to the coronavirus and I recieved unemployment benefits. Found a job, similar to the old one, and applied. Got the job. Anxiety took over and got to a point where I went three days with bad sleep and not eating any food. Fear came out and lied to my boss as to why I was leaving because I had a job opportunity. I worked 4 days. Only getting paid for yesterday, as training did not count. Now I feel like I lost unemployment, I lost a job and came home crying last night, and now I still feel miserable with anxiety. Except this time, with massive guilt. What should I do?"

Anxiety,Need advice to calm down,I have an appointment coming up soon. But I didn’t realize that it’s quite a ways from my house. Because of the virus I’m taking all the precautions required to make sure I am staying safe and not risking getting someone else sick. My problem now it’s how do I make it to my appointment that I can’t cancel. I don’t have a car. I can probably borrow a car but I have lots of driving anxiety. I’m not comfortable taking public transit lately and worst taking an Uber. I’m so conflicted about what the best solution is. Maybe this is a test for me to get over my fear of driving. I don’t know but it makes me so nervous.
Anxiety,Has anyone tried an online therapy/counseling service?,"I’m searching for a therapist, but with the current COVID crisis it’s more difficult to find one that I’m able to get to using public transportation (I don’t have a car). Has anyone used an online therapist? If so, which one and what were your thoughts on it? Was it helpful?"

Anxiety,zoom calls in breakout mode trigger panic attacks,"I don't know why, but whenever the teacher puts us in breakout rooms I tremble really badly and I have to turn off my camera so the other people won't see me hyperventilating and crying. The people he puts me with are my classmates, they're not mean or anything but the thing is they're strangers to me. I stopped taking medication about two months ago. I think I may have social anxiety, I react very badly to social situations; even the thought of going to the store makes me completely fearful. Whenever we have to do presentations I shake so fucking badly and I panic to the point where I nearly faint in the god damn bathroom stall. My classmates shout a lot and it triggers traumatic memories that I'm trying to battle resulting in a panic attack. I hate how my parents banned me from going to therapy in November. I've genuinely felt better without my medications too hence why I stopped taking them. I really really really want to get better but each time I make progress I always fall back to the same spot. I can never improve."
Anxiety,Health anxiety back,My health anxiety is back and panick attacks I keep thinking I am going to die again off some undiagnosed disease am terrified off death and I have trust issues with doctors my little sister died at 19 and she was very ill a rare disease etc and they lied to us and promised a heart valve replacement etc and she died and they admitted they knew she would but it was in her interest and the family’s not to tell us to enjoy our time with her and because she was so young when she became ill 15 and it would off impacted her life and ours as a family etc but now I think are they lying to me am I ill?

Anxiety,feeling overwhelmed lately,"in between my return to uni (through online classes) and the constant worry i might be hurting people close to me, i've been feeling too anxious these days up to the point where i don't have energy to function anymore, i'm exhausted and i can't even go to my psychotherapist because they aren't taking appointments while the quarantine lasts... i've been having nightmares lately, about me failing this semester, about my relationship falling apart... still, time goes on and i have to do schoolwork but i really don't have the energy to do that, i just can't say loud enough how much i want to wake up in 2019 and feel like this year hasn't happened at all"
Anxiety,I'm finally going to the Dr about my anxiety and I'm terrified,I've been dealing with (un diagnosed) anxiety and depression my whole life. It's been really really bad lately. Like I want to say the past 6 months it's gone from me being able to work my way through it to me not being able to get through the day without  freaking out. I made an appointment with a new doctor and I'm so fucking scared to go and I don't even know why. I'm thinking about canceling or just not showing up.

Anxiety,My anxiety is convincing me I’m doing terribly,"It’s 3 am and I have a 7 am call with work. And I can’t sleep. 

Somehow my work takes twice as long to get even close to the usual quality I once had.

I procrastinate. Then crunch. Then beat myself after I send work in, convinced it’s terrible. If only I’d started sooner. It took twice the effort and twice the time. But it must be worse than ever. And it’s all my fault.

I moved around the world for a dream that fell through and I feel stuck here. Aimless. Stagnant. Sinking. And very alone. 

I miss the time when I didn’t think that I, and everything I did, was terrible."

Anxiety,Had a really anxious week and now low mood..?,"My anxiety has flared up very badly in the last week. I’m having some relationship problems but also have uni work and obviously it has been a really strange time for everyone with the lockdown situation which I think is starting to get to me. The last week I have been having panic attacks several times a day and just generally feeling extremely anxious, having palpitations and butterflies in my stomach constantly. One night I was up all night with this butterfly sensation in my stomach - every time I started to fall asleep it woke me up. My body is absolutely exhausted and so tense as there has been so much adrenaline pumping around it.

I rang my doctor and she prescribed me 3 x 10mg Propranolol a day which I have been on before and found they really helped. I’ve been taking them since yesterday and I do feel a lot more relaxed this evening but very weak and tired, and I’m struggling to sleep. I also have no appetite. What I am worried about is that I seem to have very low mood which is unusual for me. I’m crying a lot and I just want to lie in bed and not do anything as I feel I can’t really do anything useful, and I don’t want to eat either. I’m just looking for some advice or anyone that has been through something similar - am I depressed or is it just a result of the severe anxiety? Do you think I may be back to normal after a few days on the tablets? Do I need to push through it and try and get on as normal? I just want to feel that I am not alone. Thank you x

TL;DR: am I experiencing low mood due to a period of intense anxiety?"
Anxiety,"Do any types of rooms give you anxiety? Ex hotel rooms, minimalist houses?","This may seem really weird but hotel rooms and minimalist spaces really trigger me. I’m staying at a relatives apartment right now which is the penthouse of a 30 story building and I just feel...caged and disassociated from everything like I’m not even a person and have no attachments. 

Has anyone else had this?"
Anxiety,Uncontrollable shaking and tremors,"So I was having a discussion with a manager at my job today about my performance and how I need to improve. It kind of felt like an interrogation into the things I was doing wrong and why. It was embarrassing at times since my colleagues were in the room listening in on how stupid I sounded and he was annoyed at me too. 

From the moment the conversation started, I began shaking uncontrollably to the point where it was easily noticeable if you looked over at me. It was like my whole body was being thrust over and over again. My heart was beating at 100mph, my head was hot and I had a little trouble breathing. On the outside I was calmly talking to my manager and explaining anything he wanted me to explain but on the inside I was burning up and just wanted to sink into the ground. I’ve always had problems when put on the spot in front of others (heart rate increasing, hot head, sweaty palms etc.) but I’ve never felt the shaking that I felt today.

It took 10 minutes after he had left the room for me to stop shaking. I never want to feel that again but it’s inevitable if a small talking to will trigger it. 

How do I solve this?"
Anxiety,Do you think it's best to directly face your anxiety or to accommodate yourself to feel better?,"This is a long and painful internal battle I've had in my head forever. If something would potentially benefit you, but you know it would be a major source of anxiety, is it better to do it or not? For me its hard to find the line between accommodation to preserve my mental health and enabling my anxiety. How do you all feel?"
Anxiety,"Can’t take a full breathe in through my nose, chest doesn’t take in air","Hi guys, so lately I’ve had this weird feeling in my chest when I breathe in through my nose. It’s like I can’t breathe in more air and I start to try to take more breaths to actually get the breathe that I want, but it doesn’t work. I can breath through my mouth at a full breath no problem. I’ve read a lot about this being anxiety but I’ve been living with bad anxiety/panic attacks since I was like 18 and this doesn’t feel the same. I don’t feel anxious but the fact that I can’t get a satisfying breathe in makes me freak tf out. It’s been keeping me up at night as well, which sucks. Any advice would help, thank you!"
Anxiety,My anxiety won’t go awayyyy,"Anxiety has always been a problem for me since I was little. Finally trying to treat it and tell my doctor; got prescribed Hydroxyzine. Heard it makes you sleepy but I have to go to work.
Idk what to do, I’ve been having bad anxiety for the past 2 days. Holding off on taking the meds because I can’t be “sleepy” right now. 
Should I take it anyways? My anxiety is baddd right now omg"
Anxiety,Does anyone have any tips for letting things go?,"I have specific moments in my life where I get flooded with memories and thoughts and get severe anxiety about how I acted, what I did, etc. Im finding it debilitating at times.

That thing you're worried about right now? You will overcome it and even if YOU don't think so, I do. And I'm hardly ever wrong, ask my husband."
Anxiety,Does anybody else have trouble eating in restaurants?,"I apologize if this has been posted before or if this isn't a typical post for this subreddit but I'm genuinely curious if this is just me. 

Ever since I was little every time I had to eat in a restaurant I would get yelled at if I ate slow or couldn't finish my food. I would get up to ""pee"" (Panic in the restroom) every single time. Now as I'm older I still have the instinct to hide in the restroom every time I go out to eat. Especially when we're waiting for food I get super anxious and just want to leave. Even if I'm not with people that would say those things or criticize me I still get nauseous and loose my appetite no matter how hungry I am. If I take my food home as soon as I walk in the door my appetite comes back and I reheat it and eat perfectly fine by myself. This has gotten so bad that even eating with my mom in the house makes me anxious, I only want to eat in my room away from people. 

Is this just me?"
Anxiety,I just want a good nights sleep,"Since I was 10 or 11 years old, I’ve been very stressed and moody person. I didn’t really know it was anxiety and depression until I was 18 to talk to a doctor about it. It is something that we never talked about at home, mental health topics are like a taboo in my culture. 

It’s eating me up, I don’t sleep as much. Very rare occasions I’ll get a good night rest, very rare. Now I get like 2-3 hours of sleep and then nap a little during the afternoon.  

I’m just so tired, I even spoke to a therapist about this (kept it hidden from my family) and she just suggested to put me on medication but I refused, i’m just scared about how it’s going to affect me. 

College was hectic for me these past few months, especially doing online classes. Now that school is over and I’m on break, I still can’t help feel whatever it is that I’m feeling. It’s causing me to lose more and more sleep, forcing myself to wake up at 7 AM for no reason at all. I don’t know what to do here.

I’ve tried mediation, I’ve tried yoga and exercise. I got rid of all my clutter and cleaned my room and bathroom. I tried to go back to my painting and drawings but nothing is helping me."
Anxiety,Its gotten to the point where i sleep a lot. I don’t want to be awake because being awake means dealing with this illness and I don’t want anything to do with this. Waking up is always a bummer especially since i wake up in a panic state,[deleted]
Anxiety,"Every time I think about Brain Aneurysms, I feel like I'm going to have one.","I wish I never learnt about the existence of brain aneurysms. I dont go a day without thinking I'm going to die in the shower or while working out. I'm not helped by the fact that I literally feel like my brain is about to explode, accompanied by head, facial and neck tightness.

Anxiety,How to deal with being alone,"I hate being alone. My anxiety goes insane. At 17 I moved out and directly into my then boyfriends house. I honestly wouldn't leave the house on my own at all. Not even to the store litterly 1 floor below me. Slowly I stopped hiding in corners while home alone and I started going outside alone while calling people.
Move fast forward couple years I moved out of my now exes place and into my own student room (its a house designed for a family of 5 that I share with 4 students). Due to corona none of them are home. They are all staying elsewhere.

Anyway the issue is I don't get any sleep. I go there. I nearly piss my pants all day. I hide under my blanket while apping everyone I know to see if someone wants to come over. If they do great, awesome. All the other times I gennerally finally crashed at 5am and had nightmare filled sleep for an hour or 2 before awakening drenched in sweat. 

My best friend lives near me. I stay with him a lot. I just stayed here a week or so. The issue is he has a studio. So yea the dude needs some space every now and then.

So now I am in the cycle of going to my place max 3 days in a row and then coming here for 2 days to week to get some actual sleep.

But yea, its not my friends responsibility I get sleep but I know he feels obligated to let me stay here because thw shit sleep I get there. And I am 21 I would really like to be able to figure out how to sleep alone


Tldr. I recently broke up with my ex and essentially live alone now. I dont get any sleep and I dont know what to do. Any tips?"
Anxiety,"Body pains are ruining my mental help, Please help","Hi I’m pretty much just ranting on here right now because I’m scared pretty sure I’m panicking and also hoping someone sees this and tells me I’m okay or just helps me.

 I have been feeling sharp chest pains, body pain, back aches, abdomen pain for the past 13 days. Not all at once though. Also got a dry throat but I got it recently after I couldn’t stop eating cold ice all day and it’s just dry nothing else but I’m still scared. I've been having a lot of anxiety lately due to fear of what’s going on in the world right now and my panic attacks became daily because of this and I even got a load of other things like nausea because of it and ya know typical anxiety symptoms. Then all of a sudden they went away and I was so happy and then I started getting these body pains which just made me 100x more anxious again. The pains are nothing that stop me from doing anything just uncomfortable and sharp sometimes and makes me scared if anything. Whenever I’m not stressed it goes away. I’m just so scared that it could be something serious and I’m only 18 and I don’t want anything bad to happen to me. I really don’t want to go to the doctor or ER because I’m scared with the things going on right now. I’m just so tired of it and wish I could get better. I miss not being in physical pain. It’s all I could think about, I just really want to get rid of this.

In short, has anyone experienced these sharp all over body pains and if you have do you have any tips to get rid of this? Does it sound like anxiety? Did you ever get better? Thank you for any advice!"
Anxiety,Anxiety has come creeping back,"I've been experiencing anxiety for about 10 months now. I've been on Lexapro for about 8 months which has seemed to help for the most part. For the past week I've been having bad anxiety and intrusive thoughts that something is wrong with me. I keep feeling dizzy and light headed and having racing thoughts that something is wrong. They haven't found anything both times through blood tests and obvservations. Is this a sign that my Lexapro is wearing off? I'm on 10mg and wanting to go to 15mg.  And feedback or help is greatly appreciated, thanks :)"
Anxiety,Dumped by my only friend!,"Over the weekend my only friend 'broke up' with me, I say broke up because I don't know how else I would put it. Anyway, we had been friends for over 20 years, since we were kids and on Saturday he blocked me on whatsapp because I hadn't seen his message for a couple of hours. He messaged me at 14:46 saying he wasn't having a great time at the moment and asked if we could talk sometime the next day, less than 2 hours later at 16:12 he left another message saying ""fair enough, take care then"".  I genuinely didn't see his message but when I did at 17:31, I replied immediately and just said that I was free for a chat at lunchtime, only he never got it because he had blocked me, must have done it when he sent his last message. I text his partner and asked what the situation was, they just said he was being stubborn and to give it time. Thing is, I really don't care, I don't want to give it time. I know I should but on reflection, he has been a really shitty friend, always borrowing money and never paying it back on time (at present he owes me £65 which I have no doubt I will never see again), always asking for help but never giving it and he only ever wants to see me when he has nobody else to hang out with or when he needs money.

While I am angry about it, that someone who was supposed to be my friend for as long as he was could be so pathetic, I am relieved that I don't have to put up with him anymore and I know I am better off without him but I do also feel quite anxious. I now have no friends, well, I have an online friend but that's it. Will I ever have a friend again? I think my problem is that I find it hard to trust people, this is not the first time something like this happened to me, a few years back my best friend who I had known almost as long, ended our friendship with no explanation other than I was selfish for not wanting to go to her dads party (despite her knowing I had social anxiety). Maybe I have just been trusting the wrong people, but after having 2 long term friendships end this way, I feel like I have lost all faith in people, so whats the point in trying anymore? I know that not everybody is untrustworthy but how do you find out?"
Anxiety,"Having really bad anxiety, and especially about earthquakes.","I moved to LA almost two years ago now so you think I would have better coping mechanisms by now. I think it’s a mixture of the lock down, and the fact there have been a few earthquakes lately.

This is why it is so important that we don't pay too much attention to our negative thoughts. Identify them, accept them and distract from them. Notice the positives, feed your mind the fuel to feel the good and helpful ❤"

Anxiety,Ever have a dream one night that ruins your sleep the next night?,"I had a dream last night that I couldn’t breathe or function (was seriously straining to talk and couldn’t walk really) properly as a result. Also that I couldn’t feel the water I was drinking.When I woke myself up, my throat was tight and I needed water and I had a headache. 

Now I can’t sleep because I don’t want to have that dream or something similar. 

This kind of thing happens to me a lot where I get anxious about repeating a dream and then won’t let myself sleep because of it :( Anyone else? It’s almost 5:30am!! this is absolutely rotten :("
Anxiety,Bad dreams..?,"Hi, 

I was just wondering if it's just me.. but whenever I dream of something, it seems like it haunts me or like it lives within me. Recently, I had a pretty random dream that I was living with my cousins and my niece was... into me? Like you know that incest kinda thing. It felt like she was running after me, pretty obsessive I must say. I was so scared and cringing at the same time. I woke up worried and nervous. I can never look my niece the same way like that dream literally haunts me down. I know it's not a big deal but it's just bothering me a lot and I have no one to talk to. Does it mean something?"
Anxiety,Week 5 on Zoloft. Do the heart palpitations/flutters go away? Pls read,"Hi this’ll be kind of long but please read and respond with any advice/insight. 
I had my first anxiety attack in January. I got home around 3am that night and I felt like my heart was going to fall out of my chest. Of course immediately I thought it was a heart attack. I felt fine the next day and was back to normal the day after that. In March I started to feel very anxious, and unlike myself. I ended up going to the doctor and she prescribed hydroxyzine since it happened more towards the evening/night and I couldn’t sleep due to the anxiety. I did not take it much as it made me feel groggy. I dealt with the anxiety for about a month until it turned into what I believe is depression, as I was crying everyday most of the day, had a decreased appetite, didn’t want to communicate with anyone or get out of bed, and in increase in panic attacks. I do believe my anxiety/depression was stress induced as I worked 2 full time jobs and went to school full time as well as trying to balance a social life. I finally went and got put on Zoloft. I started with 25mg the first week and then increased to 50mg per my PCP. I’m currently on week 4 of 50mg (5 weeks of Zoloft total). I do feel better as I’m not crying every day and I’m not having panic attacks often. But I do still have a bit of trouble sleeping at night as I feel like my heart is going crazy. I had a EKG done when I was first prescribed the hydroxyzine and everything came back normal with my heart. But why do I still feel my heart acting weird? What is causing it? My pulse is usually in the 80’s-90’s when I check it so it’s not racing, but I feel my heart fluttering and I feel my heart beat is strong. It feels like my heart is skipping a beat. It happens more when I’m laying it bed trying to go to sleep. I also feel on edge. I get scared when I think about hanging out with others (when social distancing is over). I just feel this fear come over me. I feel like my General state is just waiting for an anxiety attack to happen. I feel so on edge all the time. Is this normal? Does Zoloft help eventually? Do I need to up my dosage? Or give it time? Any advice would help! Thank you so much!!  

tl;dr: on week 4 of 50mg of zoloft (week 5 total) and I still feel my heart fluttering and my heart beating lousy (like it’s skipping a beat). Does it go away? Do I need to up my dosage or give it time? It feels stronger when I’m laying down not doing anything and trying to go to sleep."

Anxiety,I once pooped myself and now I have to poop everytime I go somewhere,"Hi, I'm 25 years old and I have a problem lol.

Not to make it extremely long, here I go:

I was on vaccation about 5 years ago and was laying on the beach when I suddenly had the urge to poop. I thought well I can hold it to finish my crossword puzzle. Then farts came in and I realized I really need to go...so stupid me, instead of just running to the toilet which was quite near I had to pack all of my things and drop them off at the tent. In camp you need a key to access the toilet and I was waiting for a friend to come back from the toilet and give it to me... bowel movements were getting too intense so I decided to jump the fence... and as lifted my leg up to jump it I couldn't hold it in anymore so I pooped myself...I went and cleaned myself up and said, well it happens and move on with my life.  


1 year later:

It was 7am and I was on my way to college, stepped out of the bus and heading towards my school when I feel a fart coming, so I fart, first checking no-one is around lol. I came to the pedestrian and the light was red... I feel another fart incoming, this one a bit stronger than last one...when I crossed the road I pick up my pace, i'm not far from my school, just a minute, you can do it I tell myself...and then the feeling of having to poop really bad came ( I never could hold my poops, maybe 2 min and that was it) so I started running, and BAM there it was in my pants again before I could reach the toilet. Again, cleaned myself up, threw away the underwear and head to the store to get a fresh pair of underwear. Keep in mind it was around 7.30 am...so I get to the store just to see they open at 9 am...every single store in the area. So I go get a coffee and wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

There, that was the moment that changed my life drastically. 

&amp;#x200B;

From that moment on, I couldn't leave my house without having the urge to poop, and it's not just an urge or false alarm, I always need to poop. At first I couldn't even take my dog out in the morning without having to poop.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been a serious problem and has created so much of anxiety for me that I cannot live my life as I once did.

 Over the years I ""learned"" to live with it, at least now it's not as severe as it once was...like literally I couldn't leave my house without worrying what to do if I have to poop ( and I always have to) , and always thinking about where the nearest bathroom is.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I mostly only get the urge in the mornings and until 1-2 pm if I have to go somewhere... if it's after that or later I don't even worry about anymore but the problem is still there.

I think it's all psychological and in my head because sometimes when I'm in a rush and I can't even think about it, it's all fine and no need to poop, but once I start thinking about it, it's over. And please don't tell me just don't think about it cuz I can't, it's engraved in my brain after all these years.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't go to any vaccations after the incident and I'm having severe anxiety when I have to go somewhere when someone else is driving (longer trip) or with public transportation that doesn't have toilets. 

&amp;#x200B;

After this corona shit I think I'll go get the professional help and hope to start living my life as I once did. 

P.S. before all of this happened I always had trouble going to nr. 2... twice a week or sometimes went without it for 2 weeks and now I can't stop pooping (the irony lol)

&amp;#x200B;

So my question and reason for posting this:

**Do any of you have the same or similar problems and if you do, how did you fix it?**

Please help me :D 

And also thanks for reading my post"

Anxiety,Job Stress - normal or extreme? Anxiety making me want to quit.,I’ve been feeling extremely stressed about my job lately to the point where I’m thinking about quitting. I’m a recent college grad who got a job right out of school and have been working there for about a year. I’ve already had to change roles as I was stressed in the sales role I had started. But I am still just as stressed as I was before and I’m at the point where I get anxiety every night before bed and every morning I dread getting out of bed and working. I’ve been WFH for about 2 months now which is about when I started in the new role. I know everything going on right now is playing a part in this (recently got back on an anti-depressant) but at the same time I’ve been stressed at this job since way prior to all this COVID lockdown stuff. I don’t know what to do as this is not an ideal time to look for other jobs but can’t see forcing myself to continue to be this stressed/anxious day in and day out.
Anxiety,Ahhhhhhh Panic mode,In a bit of panic mode... my throat has been tasting disgusting and my stomach has been hurting from so much stress and anxiety and it’s made me have a full blown panic attack as I’m scared I’m gonna puke my guts out (phobia of being sick) and my face has gone so tingly urghhhhh what shall I do ?!!
Anxiety,Anxiety preventing me from driving and finding a job,"I’m turning 18 soon. 0 clue how to drive and never had a job before. I hope I don’t sound stupid, but I’m just really scared of driving and the idea of working also scares me. All my friends say that driving is the easiest shit on earth, and I do believe them, but I’m still scared of crashing/dying. My parents are constantly offering to teach me how to drive since we’re quarantined, but I keep saying no and now they just think I’m lazy when it’s not the case. I really wanna learn how to drive, but I’m just really scared. My parents want me to get a drivers license when I turn 18 in August and it’s kinda stressing me out, but it’s not their fault because they don’t know about my fears. 

As for the job, I have 0 clue how to find one. They taught us that in school, but it’s my fault for not listening. But my point is that the idea of working terrifies me. I’m terrible at socializing so I’m scared that I won’t get along with my coworkers. I’m also really clumsy, kinda slow and kinda have bad hearing. I know everyone makes mistakes, but I’m scared I’ll get fired for making too many dumb mistakes. I don’t believe I’m competent enough, but at the same time I really want a job. I just want to be independent and try new things. Most of my friends already know how to drive and has a job too and it sucks that I’m the only one left out."
Anxiety,My story of anxiety disorder and getting over it.,"I have self learned english, so there might be some mistakes but since this community has helped me one way or another I thought I would share my story. Maybe it will help someone who is going through this. 

I’m a male in my early thirties. It all started a year ago for me, when I had some health problems with my heart. I visited a lot of doctors and paid a lot of money for those visits, and no one of them could not say what was wrong with my heart and why it was acting like it was. I spent all my savings and money on these procedures. It made me go through a lot in my head and in some period of time I was sure I'm not going to live more than a year and I kind of accepted my faith but mentally it was not doing me anything good. So I lived with that knowledge in the back of my head. After that came a lot of disappointments. First I'm self employed. I have my own little business and shit hit the fan, there was no money coming in and I started to think about the future. How I’m going to get through next month and how will I be able to pay the bills and so on. Actually I was thinking like this for years, even when there was money coming in. On side I was finishing school, I was in my last year and it was not going very well for me, because I was thinking about the problems that were ahead and I could not focus on school anymore. So I decided to quit school just to get it out of my way as a problem and thought it would give me more time to focus on my business ventures. But this in my mind was even bigger disappointment since when I went back to school, I said to myself that this time I’m going to finish it (I have been failed 3 times before). After that came relationship problems as my girlfriend had to move to another country for half a year. At first it was okay, but after a few months we were not so close anymore as she started to ignore me more and more for some reason. And this was destroying my mental health even more and broke my heart. Everything was just fucked up in my head and I saw only problems ahead of me. I was living a month ahead in my head with only problems on my mind. I saw no future in anything and was thinking about shit that could happen in future. Then came the covid-19 panic. I really was not immersed in it, but panic in society made me feel it one way or another. Slowly I started to feel shortness in breath til one day I tried to go to sleep and I thought I could not breathe anymore. I was trying to breath in but It seemed to me that there was no oxygen going into my lungs. I panicked the fuck out and called my self an ambulance. They looked me over and gave me some tranquilizers to calm me down and said that I was having a panic attack. Shortness of breath went away at that moment and I got to go to sleep. After waking up in the morning It was back, I just could not breath normally as I was gasping for air. I contacted my doctor and told him what was happening. She gave me some test forms that filled and told me that I have anxiety disorder and gave me a prescription for xanax. At the start It was helping me as I was not gasping so much anymore. So I took one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening. And one major mistake I made was that I was smoking weed day in and day out for months because I thought It would calm me down and help me go through my problems.I thought it would help me since it had done it before in my life. But little did I know that weed and xanax is a dangerous mix. As I learned later, weed blocks the receptors in the brain that should consume xanax and because of that the xanax stayed in my bloodstream for much longer than It should. Anyway, I did it for almost two months. My anxiety disorder got worse. Quite often I felt that I want to throw up...and I did. I could not think straight. I felt pressure in the back of my head and had panic attacks all day long. I could not go grocery shopping or to the hairdresser anymore as I thought I could not handle my panic attacks anymore. I was dizzy all the time. I thought I was going insane as I could not focus on anything anymore. One morning I was trying to make myself a tea… a simple task but I could not do it. I was pretty sure that this is it, I'm going insane and there is no way back from it. Then the suicidal thoughts got me. As I have always been a lone wolf (introvert as fuck) there were not a lot of supporters also. I contacted my girlfriend who went away and told her what was going on, to get some support and she told me “there is nothing she can do about it, it's your own fault” and that's it. As I was looking for only social support and got this answer it made it even worse. Anyway one night I was holding 10 xanax pills in my hand and remember thinking by myself, why I should not end this all. I felt alone, I was broke, seeing only problems coming in, disappointments, heartbroke, so close to being insane, seeing no way out. Some people told me that I should contact a psychiatrist, but since I was broke I could not afford it anymore. All my money and savings was spent on heart problems before It all started. 

And as I sat there in lonliness by myself I somehow started thinking, okay, this is my situation. What can I do about it? If it gets any worse I’m going to die anyway. So I took all those pills and put them back to my drawer. And said to myself that I'm going to die or get over this and made myself an agreement that I would not take another xanax anymore or smoke weed. I decided to go cold turkey. And then the real shit hit the fan...If you are not going through this, never go cold turkey. Just reduce the doses little by little. I went cold turkey and because I smoked weed, my brain was blocking xanax as I said before. It circulated in my bloodstream and because of that my body was extremely addicted to xanax. First night I went to bed and I had cold sweat, seizures, nausea, thought of a heart attack and so on.. I was sure that this night would be the last night. I could not stand it, and then I realised that I should just reduce doses. So I took one pill and got to sleep somehow. In the morning the first thing I did was throw up. I now took only half of xanax everyday and it was a total nightmare as I was throwing up 3-5 times a day and not sleeping very well. I was force eating … there just was no appetite but I knew that I needed to give my body something to recover up on. For a week everyday I thought that I would not make it. But I did not give up, because I already did not have anything to lose, only to gain. Going through this with my anxiety disorders, loneliness and broken heart was the hardest thing I have done in my life so far. After a week or so, the nausea started to fade a way day by day. 

The dizziness, pressure in my head and anxiety disorder remained. This was the first gain. Next thing I did was that I thought that I needed to know what is causing all this. What was causing anxiety disorder and so on. Get to the roots of all this. As I did not have any money to afford a psychiatrist. I thought it was a good idea to do research about books that are about anxiety disorders. I found a book by Arlin Cuncic “A 7-Week Plan to Overcome Anxiety, Stop Worrying, and End Panic”. From there I got knowledge of what is causing anxiety disorder. I also learned that there are different variations of it and what kind of anxiety disorders I was going through. As I acknowledged I had very low confidence, Social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. And it is all caused by overthinking about the future, things that have never happened and most probably will not happen ever. So I started to do research about how to raise my confidence, how to be better at socialising and how to live one day at the time. I'm still working on it. I also started working out. I do 100 push-ups a day, 10 push-ups after every hour or so. I bought myself a low cost bicycle, and I’m just riding it as much as possible everyday. One day I did 103km (64 miles) just to prove myself I can do it.

As I was doing all that my anxiety disorder remained, but the main thing that helped me get over it (at least I think so) is another book. As I was buying Arlin Cuncic book I stumbled on another book by Nick Vujicic “Life Without Limits: How to live a ridiculously good life” and since it was on sale, I thought that books will keep my mind busy. I'll give it a chance. Now Nick is a man who has no hand and no legs and is still living a prolific life. Nick is talking a lot about god in his book and how faith is helping him. So I thought that why not give it a try. I'm not saying that I believe in god now and are going to church every sunday and so on. I’ll do it in a more 2pac’ish way. If you don't know what i mean by that search it up from youtube “2pac talking about his belief in God and religion”. Churches and that kind of stuff is a little absurd to me (no offence to anyone, it's just my opinion). I just started to trust life and to believe that there might be some higher power (and I’m also naming it god) that is helping me if I am helping myself. And after that realisation I have not felt anxiety disorder and it has been a month for now. Not anything major at least. In conclusion I think that helped me most is to learn how to live in the moment, there is no reason to worry about the future, because nobody knows what tomorrow brings. Covid-19 is a perfect example of how fast things can change. So why worry about it. And the second thing is to just trust life, have faith in something. After I started doing that I do not feel so lonely even if I am alone. 

After I got my things under control I contacted the school and told them what had happened with my mental health and they helped me out with all the classes that were not going so well. And I'm still going to graduate this year. 

My business is starting to slowly make more money and I’m not that worried about my future. It is what it is.

 I’m not taking any xanax anymore and I’m not smoking weed. I’m not saying that I will not ever smoke again, but I will not hide my problems under it. 

I also started meditating a month ago to clear my mind and thoughts. If you want to try that I recommend a headspace app. There are a lot of very good free lessons to start with.  Next thing I also did, I started learning guitar. At first it's very frustrating but if you learn to trust the process and give it time, things will get better. Important thing is to keep learning somthing that you like. If you don't do that you will stop living. 

 I’m still going through heartbreak but I accept it as a simple sadness and I believe that even if I’m sad at the moment there is something better ahead.

For closure I would say that I’m thankful that I decided not to give up. Today Im feeling as a normal person again. I know how it feels to go through this, but I also know that anxiety disorder is only in our heads. Everything else is made up by our mind. So if you can think yourself in a deep hole it is possible to think into better places. And I know, in some situations it seems impossible. Even if you are going throght this fucking shit alone, you are not alone. I would be extremely happy if it helps anyone somehow, but if not...this is my story and something told me I should share it."
Anxiety,Who else loves to heat their clothes up in the microwave then put them right on?,I love it...
Anxiety,I had another attack yesterday. I thought I had a handle on this.,"So just really quick, dealt with a lot of unexpected death in the last 4 years. My mother (62) four years ago passed from a massive arrhythmia. My brother in law (40) took his own life. And my Father (69) just passed away In February from cancer. My fathers passing was the only one we knew was coming. Only a couple weeks after the hurricane that is a wake and a funeral- we were put into this quarantine/lockdown. I feel like I can’t grieve. 

I feel weak and I’m afraid and nervous about everything. Yesterday I went into work, walked in..... and then immediately walked out. Fight or flight and I ran.  Called in sick from the parking lot and went home. I did some meditation/breathing and calmed down a lot. I just feel like a complete failure. I feel lost without my parents, and I’m 41. Needing them at 41 makes me feel weak too. I have tried in the past to contact a doctor to talk to. I always hit a hurdle and give up on myself because I truly believe I’m not worth it. I get told the doctor isn’t accepting new patients or the earliest appointment we have is 6 months from now. I’m hurting now. I need help now. My general doctor put me on Lexapro a while ago when my father was in really bad shape towards the end. It did nothing but made me feel numb. I don’t want drugs. 

I don’t know. 

Thanks for reading this if you did. 

I’m just in a really bad place."
Anxiety,I’m having really weird thoughts,So for the past couple days now I’ve been having this question bugging me like a ring worm in my head am I gay? And it’s gotten to the point where I can’t sleep because of the possibility and the thought itself. The ironic thing is that I’ve been in a hetero relationship the past year but I can’t shake this feeling or thought but I’m not turned on by men at ALL nor do I feel any emotional attachment passed friendship but my brain still wants me to believe somehow I am. It’s messing with me a lot now and was wondering if anyone had any idea on what this is or how I can maybe fix it and start sleeping again thanks
Anxiety,Family who triggers anxiety and trauma,"I think Im gonna lose my mind, since March I've been trying to keep my sanity while staying indoors with my family. 

My Mom was already dead and I dont have a good relationship with my sister and father. Our relationship was strained by some happenings from the past. Im not comfortable around them, it brings back anxiety and trauma. I can only talk to my little brother, we're really close, without him I cant hold on.

I want to go outside, I want to talk to someone who really kows me and Im comfortable with, but I cant because I need to stay inside. Its mentally draining especially if your household members are the ones who triggers you.

Having anxiety also affects my productivity especially now that Im in WFH set-up. I cant express myself freely, I just want everything to end."
Anxiety,Advice for helping boyfriend deal with anxiety?,"Hi, all. Hoping you can offer me some insights as to how to navigate this whole situation. My boyfriend has recently started having panic attacks and it's added a whole new level of stress for both of us. 

We've tried to cut out caffeine and alcohol, get to bed earlier, etc. All the basic tips I've found online. And he has a doctors appointment tomorrow. 

The problem I'm having now is that anytime there's a conflict between us for completely unrelated reasons, no matter how minor, it sends him into a spiral of anxiety for the whole day or longer. Which basically has left me unable to express any negative emotion toward him (ie: why did you leave the new trash bag next to the overflowing trashcan for me to take care of instead of just changing the bag yourself when you realized that it was full?). I've tried to bring things like this up calmly, but even that is enough to set him off right now, so I've been trying to be extra empathetic and just keep things to myself, but then I end up getting more and more frustrated and stressed, which isn't fair to me either. We need a better plan of attack, but I don't know what to do at this point.   

He says even simple tasks have become overwhelming, which, again, I'm empathetic to, but it means that 90% of the household tasks fall to me and I am so tired of feeling like I'm just here to clean up after him and hold our lives together while tiptoeing around, trying not to upset him.

Thoughts? Suggestions?"
Anxiety,Experiences of feeling dismissed by doctors?,"So yesterday I went in to see the person that for the last 8 years I considered my GP. I told her my anxiety was causing sweating and trembling to the point it’s seriously affecting my life, and gave a few examples of situations that happened because of those things. She prescribes Lexapro and says it will start working in about a week. Cool.

Then I asked her to take a look at a mole, and she touches my arm. She goes “Ohmygosh, **why are you trembling???**”

And I’m like. MY. ANXIETY. Suddenly the trembling needed to be addressed immediately and she prescribed beta blockers, which did immediately relieve both symptoms. 

But I just don’t get it, what the hell did she think I meant when I said it was a serious issue? 

Then, as a kicker, I looked a little closer at my prescription and realized me “GP” of the last 8 years isn’t even a doctor, she’s a PA. I haven’t seen an MD since I was a child.

Anyway, anyone else have similar stories?"
Anxiety,Can you offer you advice? My anxiety is making me sick.," Hi everyone. I've only just discovered this subreddit. I've posted it on anxietydepression also.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation and could really do with some help.

I was diagnosed with Depression, anxiety and OCD at the age of 16. I am now 29. Since I was 18 I've loved acting. To the point it is all I think about. I got a degree in film studies and screen writing and spent most of my time at uni wanting to do acting. My anxiety really gets in my way and I didn't really chase opportunities. With this getting in my way, It would constantly depress me. This year, I applied for a masters degree as a way of making up for the regret that I didn't study acting for a career. I live in Birmingham, but the masters I got accepted into is in London. Approximately 2 hours and 30 minute commute away. When I applied I didn't really think it was a serious option, it was more of whether I could see if I could get into it. Last week, I had an email from the uni saying that I had been awarded a scholarship for 50% of my tutition fees after applying for it. Since then it has made me really anxious. I'm not eating, I constantly feel sick. When I'm really anxious, I throw up. I've lost nearly 12 pound in weight in the past 6 days. I've been crying a lot. I told my fiance that I didn't want to do it, and broke down. She said I was being selfish. That for the past 7 years, I've been depressed because I wasn't doing what I wanted to do and that I've carried regret because I didn't do the right degree. I am currently unemployed because I'm just way to anxious with even the idea of getting a job. I feel absolutely worthless. I feel really fucking stupid. Being an actor is all I've wanted and now that I have a great opportunity, it has really got me thinking, maybe its an industry that isn't for me.

Not sure if this is necessary to the story. Last year I tried overdosing on paracetamol and I am a self harmer. I cut myself every so often.

I'm currently waiting for my counselling session tomorrow.

The more I think about it, the more I don't want to do it but I feel really selfish for putting my fiance through all this for nothing and secondly for having oppotunity that not many people have and not pursuing it.

Can someone please help. I've just sick of feeling this way."
Anxiety,Dentist troubles,"I have a really bad fear of the dentist. Unfortunately, however, my teeth have a lot of cavities and they have to be taken care of before they advance to something worse. 

Now, I have a very understanding dentist. She's gentle, kind and explains everything that has to be done. Me and my mother go together, we're happy with the work she's doing. 
However anytime I think about the fact I'll have to face another needle and have my gums poked, I begin to feel absolutely awful. My heart jumps. My body tenses up. I have almost cried at the dentist chair.

Last time she was doing one of my back molars. The first problem was the needle. She put half a vial of anaesthesia, it didn't numb me enough. I asked her to give me another one. She did so, same result. So she resolved to another type of anaesthesia where she had to put it at the back of my gums (in the muscle itself) - medical side of Reddit would know what that is, I personally don't. 
It numbed me but also left me even more scared. 
Another thing that happened was that she didn't put a filling in but a medicine to restore some of the tooth. It made me anxious that it may not work... I got even more worried. 

I have an appointment tomorrow. I will probably have to face another needle in my gums. I will have to face my overwhelming fear that I'll lose my teeth. 
No matter how confident I am after every appointment that it didn't really hurt as much, anytime before the appointment I feel so overwhelmed with anxiety that I can barely sleep, which doesn't help me at all. 

Do you guys have any advice?"
Anxiety,I compare myself into depression and sadness,"I think I’ve known this in the back of my mind for awhile now but tonight it’s really occurred to me that the past few years of my life, or at least whenever I get really down and depressed in life and I start to feel like I have no direction, I find that I’m comparing myself to others. I find that there’s usually someone that’s found their way into my life somehow and then turned their back on me even tho I still very much want to interact and keep them in my daily life. Whether that be friends and friend groups like in HS that casted me out, or more recently, my ex that doesn’t like me anymore even tho I still very much think about her everyday. I find that I start to compare my life to theirs and I constantly think about what they’re doing and who they’re doing it with and I just get in the dumps about my own situation. I’ve always been an introvert with very little friends and when I was younger it didn’t bother me as much but it started to bother me in HS, then I managed to get over it for a bit coming into senior year and my first year of uni, (mostly cuz I think I got busy with myself with a job and just started not genuinely not caring what others were doing) but now I find that feeling of being lonely and unwanted is back. Which puts me in kind of a stale depression that is constantly in the front of my mind. 

Anyway, if u read all this I appreciate it and I just wanted to get this off my chest. I’m sure some of u guys can relate."
Anxiety,Alcohol increases Anxiety,"Is it possible just a few sips or drinks that alcohol makes me fidgety and later on Anxious? I can’t stay put when I’m at social engagement and always kinda looking to leave or disappear when its a booze and talking event!

I had a few light beer yesterday and my sleep was terrible and i wasn’t tired but rather fidgety when i went to bed...

I also have a hard time getting drunk, not a fun experience for me!"
Anxiety,Does anyone else feel physically weak all the time?,
Anxiety,Does anyone else cringe everytime Facebook reminds you of posts you made years ago?,"TLDR: Embarassed by old Facebook posts and triggered at the thought of how it has shaped my current situation.


Something that is triggering is seeing my old Facebook posts. I was filthly, I was highly opinionated, I wrote paragraphs really goofy trying to sound profound, and I just cringe. 

Okay so sure, they are from 5 to 6 years ago and only I can see it but what bothers me is how all the same things Im going through now, I was obviously going through similar issues then. Id always be depressed then get to a point where I write on facebook to draw a line in the sand with a drawn out press release style update on how ""this is the moment I make my comeback"". Also one of the most sobering thoughts is ""Is this why I dont have a lot of friends? Is that why this didnt work out because I looked like a goof on fb? I wonder how much of that affected my current situations"""
Anxiety,"Long time lurker, scared to take the first step towards therapy.","Hi all, I’ve been a part of this sub for a long time but never posted. I met with a new GP for our first appointment virtually and when she saw my diagnosis of anxiety was very encouraging about pursuing therapy, and even gave me some good advice about finding a therapist.

But the idea of even pursuing therapy frightens me. I worry that maybe I’m “misdiagnosed”, or my anxiety isn’t bad enough. I feel like I’m not good at being able to explain my symptoms or my thoughts and feelings.  I question myself wondering if I really need it, even though a part of me feels like I do.

I guess I’m wondering if anyone else here has felt the same way and how they moved past it?"
Anxiety,help,"TRIGGER WARNING !!

\&gt;

hi so im a fifteen year old that's here for some advice or any piece of information at all. 

i am someone whos had to grow up in a house where I was constantly neglected and abused. i still continue living under the same situations, unfortunately. my older brother's success has always pressured me. everyone expects something that is greater than his achievements from me. both of us take interest in very varying fields. (he's into sports and journalism whereas I'm into art and writing) 

I recently entered high school and the weight on my shoulders is just agonising. constant crying and arguments and doubting myself. 

quarantine has been bad. like bad, bad. everyone's always arguing or coming at me for doing or not doing something. i haven't been able to keep up with classes or get a proper night of sleep. i keep having panic attacks which just seem to anger my parents. i end up passing out or having an asthma attack almost everyday. i keep crying for hours and hours on end.

but the past few days have been different. my parents have been asking me if I'm doing okay or if there's anything I want to tell them. most people would see this is an improvement in their behavior or something great but not for me. 

i do admit that it is nice to have them check up on me. however am someone that grew up with absolutely no familiarity with affection or proper care. i was always left alone to fend for myself. so their sudden concern is in a way terrifying (?) to me. i don't really know how to explain it. i want to tell them but I'm afraid. will it lead to them hurting me or will i end up hurting myself? their concern has in fact made things worse for me in a way. i keep worrying about what they would think of me and how they would react. if i should ask them for a meeting with a psychiatrist or if I should tell them since they ARe my parents. not going to lie, I feel like if I tell them they might see me as a sick body or an insane person. what if it is true?  maybe it is because I'm going insane, who knows?

i just need something or someone that can let me know that I'm not just an overthinking mess and what i should do next

Anxiety,My girlfriend lost her memories of me,"This happened recently, my girlfriend is on medication for depression and anxiety, she hasn't had an attack in around 5 months.. 

Today she had a horrible attack leading to her forgetting who I am and anything we did the night before and all in all she can't place me in any memories.
Is this memory loss permanent? What should I do? Please help me... I dont know how to help her

 We've been dating for 7 months and spend our day to day lives together yet she can't remember any of it. She got a shot of Valium to calm it down... I just don't know what to do"
Anxiety,Worst experience of my life,"So about 2 hours ago, i had to pick up a package for my mom from the post office. Whwn i get there there is this HUGE package that is extremely heavy. My mom refused to come help me when i called her.
So i had to carry this big ass box all the way home WALKING. I looked absolutely ridiculous. Everybody was staring at me and holding in their laughter.
I am at this point so embarassed that i am not even embarassed. Like this is too much for me.
I had to explain to 5 people on the way home why i was struggling to carry the damn thing."
Anxiety,I’m about to fail an oral exam lol,"I haven’t studied because of my intense avoidance-like anxiety, or failure anxiety, whatever it’s called. It’s in German ii and I don’t speak German, lol. And it’s also oral, so. Not sure why I’m posting this but yeah. I need to pass this exam so i can start studying in the fall, or else I’ll have to wait an entire year again. I should have graduated in 2018 but here i am. I’ve already puked twice today and cried a lot so :) im so tired of this sht i really am"
Anxiety,Do you ever find yourself checking something over and over again?,"Like for example, I’d turn off the stove and the lights outside and come lay down to sleep. I get in the most comfortable position and I’d start thinking, what if I left the stove on? What if the door is unlocked?...etc. Even if I checked once before, sometimes I’d start thinking maybe I didn’t check properly the last time and go back to check. 

This has become exhausting now. I haven’t been diagnosed but I was just wondering if this was something you guys deal with?"
Anxiety,THERAPY: Gestalt Therapy?,So I am used to doing CBT but I tried Gestalt Therapy for the first time last night. I don’t think I like it...there’s a lot of “body work” but I dunno it just feels so strange to me. I am very open to meditation and things like that so it’s not like I am close-minded. The therapist had me stand in one place and imagine my body didn’t exist past my skin...and then had me walk on the spot for like a minute. I just don’t get it. I mean I did burst into tears so maybe it is working? I am wondering if anyone else found this type of therapy helpful? I feel like I prefer CBT.
Anxiety,Loose interest quickly,"Hey reddit. I rarely ever post but I’m looking for suggestions. I have a hard time committing to anything really asides for a actual relationship. I am a very loyal person when it comes to that, but literally anything else under the sun I loose interest in a snap. It’s very frustrating because I would like to have hobbies outside of work and I can’t seem to maintain an interest long enough to get good at it. For example, and this isn’t a very serious one but it’s a testament to how these type of things usually go. 

I got animal crossing about 2 weeks ago. I was super into it, played for hours and then now all of a sudden I’m just bored of it. I really want to have an interest and stay committed but I just can’t. This applies to many things in my life that I have tried, and quit. The ambition is there initially, then I just get drained and loose focus. Playing musical instruments, sports, learning sign language, starting to bake.. all ended the same way and i hate that I’m like this. Anyone else have the same type of issue? I appreciate anyone who took the time to read all of this. Tried to keep it as short and to the point as I could. Thanks in advance!!"
Anxiety,does anyone else have really bad anxiety while getting their picture taken?,i have to get my picture taken today and i get anxious just thinking about it. i will probably cry afterwards since i always do. i get a mix of anxiety and low self esteem and it’s an awful combination
Anxiety,What is the biggest lie your anxiety ever made you believe in?,"There is kind of one thing that makes me anxiety, I have a thought that I might have a certain mental disorder (besides anxiety ;) ).
I am ruminating over it the last month and it makes my anxiety horrible.

I already convinced my self a year ago that I don’t have it but now my anxiety and mind trying to convince me otherwise, and boy, anxiety can make you believe in pretty much anything.

Would love to hear some stories/advice.
I’m on therapy btw that helped me for a long time but now it’s back."
Anxiety,Not even awake for an hour yet today.,"I wake up in the morning &amp; my mind immediately starts racing. *better check the news feed. How bad are things today? How scared do I need to be* 
The thought of this virus *never* going away (as some articles suggest) &amp; this being our new normal really scares me, on so many levels. 
Legit wondering when the suicides will start? When will people who struggle with anxiety &amp; depression just throw in the towel because there is zero hope for “normalcy” ever again?"
Anxiety,"Was my therapist not very good, or do I have wrong expectations?","I recently started speaking with a therapist due to extreme anxiety and panic attacks that started after quarantining alone for 2 weeks with covid. In short, I thought I was dying and wasn’t eating well the whole time, while also not speaking to anyone. So now I have panic attacks and anxiety about pretty much everything, but primarily my anxiety is over the anxiety itself, and feeling like it will make me go insane and hurt myself in some way.

Regarding the therapist, we had 3 sessions together before I cut it off. The first one I felt like I learned a bit. She helped me recognize what the anxiety is (fear) and somewhat pinpoint where it stems from. However, throughout all 3 sessions, I never felt as if she was truly trying to find the root of *my personal* issues with anxiety. She would ask a few questions, which I would answer in great detail, and she would then respond with something usually very short and sympathetic, followed by what felt like a very pre-packaged talk about meditation and mindfulness.

Are most therapy sessions supposed to feel like a pre-packaged lecture? I guess I was expecting her to really dig deep and try to understand my specific problems with anxiety, but it always just felt like she was pretending to understand, only to end up going over things she planned before the session even started."
Anxiety,mom doesnt care about me,"she wants me to go to the dentist even though we're in the pandemic...for...a check up......

i told her i dont want to go ( i was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and have extreme anxiety) and she doesnt even care....she just doesnt care about what im going through then wonders why i never speak to her"
Anxiety,Its okay to not be okay,"Unpopular opinion: I hate the saying “Its okay to not be okay.” LIke yeah its okay to not be okay, but that doesn’t mean I want to be “not okay”? I dont want to be “okay” with not being okay. I want to be OKAY in general."
Anxiety,24yo male experiencing increased anxiety,"I’m a 24 years old male and it feels like my anxiety has gotten so much worse over the last couple months. I had my first few anxiety attacks in January after two back to back trips for work. I’ve always been afraid of flying but could usually handle it and be distracted. These turned into full blown attacks (crying on bathroom floor). It now seems every work call or presentation my anxiety is much worse than it was for similar things over the last 5 years. I just went on a road trip with a friend and experienced another anxiety attack just from driving too far. I spoke with my brother and he said his anxiety got a lot worse during this time in his life, but medication seemed to make it worse and affect him negatively altogether. Any recommendations for reducing anxiety? Therapy, meds?"
Anxiety,Slow and deep breathing with breath hold (if possible) improves sleep quality and morning anxiety,"Slow and deep breathing with breath hold while going to sleep (at least for 10 minutes) is helping me with mouth dryness and anxiety in the morning. 

I'm coming to this conclusion after trying different pillows, humidifier and many other techniques.

I think the reason is my body is going into full on rest-and-digest mode while going to sleep and maintaining the calm state throughout the night, just my guess."
Anxiety,Excessive Tiredness/Zoloft,"My doctor put me on Sertraline (Zoloft) in March of 2019. It’s worked great for me since then.

A year later in March of this year (2020) also when this COVID-19 started in my area of staying home I have started to be excessively tired. Like sleeping 10 hours a night then needing a 2 hour nap every other day. 

My only thought is that it’s an effect of Zoloft???

But then I wonder why I didn’t have this effect the whole year before this started while on it.

Any ideas???"
Anxiety,"I found a cavity on my tooth and because I can't go to the dentist rn I can't sleep, keep crying, keep worrying","I am really drained. Haven't been able to concentrate on anything but my teeth (I have found a small black dot on one of them) since last week. And because of this pandemic, I won't be able to go to the dentist and get help any time soon. I feel so weak. I try to do things I enjoy/do my work, but every few minutes I am reminded that something is wrong with my tooth and I just zone out and become so sad and stressed. Does anybody have any tips? I think I get ""obsessed thoughts""?"
Anxiety,Anxiety over internet accounts,"I made several Apple accounts throughout the past couple years. I want to get rid of them because I don't use them anymore, but some of them have balances and I have to call Apple Support to have them cleared, in order to delete them. I'm worried I'll get flagged when I call because I have the same phone number for each, and I think they'll be suspicious that I have multiple accounts.

It doesn't help that with each gmail I have for them, I'm worried I'll get locked out and won't be able to access them. I'd just delete them, which is what I want to do because I don't use those either, but then what if I can't delete my Apple accounts without having access to my gmails?

My ADHD's been on my back lately, especially since I'm cooped up in my place because of the pandemic. Everything feels like I can't do anything.

Am I weird for feeling anxious over something so stupid?"
Anxiety,"I think I’m having an anxiety attack, how do I stop it?","I recently found out something that drove me to have possibly my first anxiety attack ever. I’ve almost never been this scared about anything before, but I couldn’t handle it last night and started shaking uncontrollably, breathing weird, and having chest pains. 

I can’t get my mind if of what’s bothering me because it relates to my imminent future so I’m still shaky, having chest pain, and in a terrible mood the following morning. How do I get out of this? Nothing is helping."
Anxiety,At which point do you involve another loved one?,A loved one (LO) drinks heavily to control anxiety. LO doesn’t think they drink in excess and it is now affecting their life outside of nights and weekends. They seem to being going further and further into numbing themself with alcohol. I’m worried about long term repercussions.
Anxiety,I kinda like receiving downvotes on reddit,"Lately I’ve grown to enjoy receiving downvotes on my comments (given that im not just shitposting) I was always afraid to give a controversial opinion in school or around friends and I grew up a total people pleaser, but here on reddit i’ll say something stupid, get downvoted and just move on with no harm done. Fake internet points dont mean anything to me but sparking conversations even if im wrong is so nice."
Anxiety,First time posting here so some back ground:,"I was first diagnosed with anxiety when I was 10, I’m now 16(17 in less than a month!) My diagnosis flipped between general and social anxiety, so eventually we gave up and called it both. I would have very similar feelings to a heart attack from over thinking and over stressing my mind out. When I was 14 I was put on an 18 month trial for Fluoxetine, and I stayed on it for... 25 months about before I wanted off (I was now 16 and hated trying to remember to take it)

Now knowing all that, I’m happy to tell you, 7 months without medication and I’m doing okay! I no longer get the bad chest pains when trying to talk to people. I still have some day’s where it’s like I’m suffocating in my own brain, but I’ve learned to work around that by having a pad of paper and a pen with me on all times. Sometimes it’s just simply I can’t get my mouth to work with my brain to release the worked Upness, and by writing it down it relieves that pressure. 

I have read so many posts on here and I wish everyone a great day!"

Anxiety,Can a vasovagal reaction’s root cause be anxiety?,"Today at work I was walking around/standing and my vision started greeting out as if I were about to pass out. My heart felt like it was racing as well. I had two waves of this. The first wave passed, but the second wave was worse and it caused me to go sit down and drink/eat something.

I’ve had vasovagal reactions before in my teens/twenties, but they were usually triggered by locked knees or severe/crippling menstrual cramps.

I have been feeling physical symptoms of anxiety for the past week and I was feeling slightly anxious this morning so I was curious if that could have been the trigger. I ate a 350 calorie breakfast. I slept alright, maybe not enough. The only thing to note is that my blood pressure was 101/65 which apparently is considered a little low.

I am 5’2”, weigh 115 lbs. No drugs or alcohol. Take BCP."
Anxiety,I'm having panic attacks all the time,"Starting to push people away because of my mood swings. I lash out at my narcissistic parents. My borderline mother deteriorated terribly lastly and I haven't made peace with the fact that my lovely mum isn't really there anymore. The pills she takes are scarry as Fuck. Makes her dead, no emotions. But you can feel them bottled up and ready to explose. And I pay the price, it makes me suffer to see her like that. I can't handle that pressure. Father is very invasive and that worsen my stress.
That coupled with a traumatic breakup of a 4 year relationship, 6 months ago. And i have an eating disorder so I barely eat. I have health issues which prevent me from eating most stuff, so I only eat carbs and feel miserable. I have chemical sensitivity which prevent me from sleeping at night. Its like God is purposefully making me suffer or something. I feel so helpless, can't even go for groceries. Depersonnalized all the time, can't handle more than 5 seconds of conversation. I refuse to take medication or psychotherapy due to history of excessive drinking. I've got NO idea how, when or if I'm gonna be better"

Anxiety,"Someone I used to consider a friend is causing me stress by posting extreme views I don’t agree with on their Facebook. I don’t want to associate with them, but I will still have to be around them at my job. What should I do?","I try to avoid confrontation at all costs, but this is someone I’m going to have to see on a regular basis once I’m able to go back to work. They seemed friendly and normal for the most part until they started posting these things online.

I’m not sure what to do in a situation like this. I’m sure any outcome will just increase my anxiety. Has anyone else gone through this with a friend? Do you just act like there’s nothing going on or is it something I should address?

I’m hoping this doesn’t break the rules here. I’m not trying to say one side of things is better than another, just that it’s not someone I want to associate with and it’s heightening my anxiety."
Anxiety,How do you even respond?,"Hello. I was chatting on the phone with a friend and she randomly asked me if I was feeling anxious. Today is one of my good days where I am not. But I responded no in a defensive way. As if having anxiety was wrong when it totally is not. It’s as if I felt like I was being attacked even though I wasn’t. Now I don’t know if I’m annoyed because of the question or because of the way I reacted. How do you even respond to that though? I’m not even sure. 

Anyways hope you guys are having a good day!"

Anxiety,What should I wear,I’m 17 years old m I always struggled on what I should wear for clothes I’m always trying to look for casual outfits but I can’t find anything I like or even comfortable wearing what should I do? Same with shoes I boughten 3 pairs that just collect dust all cost me 100$ + because I don’t know if they actually look good on me. Yet I bought them same with shirts it’s like the story of my life. Also i have been on a steady workout plan and lost all my weight so none of my clothes fit me even my belts I just need advice. Everything I wear at the moment looks old I want to change how I look so bad comfortably.
Anxiety,My therapy might be ending very soon,"I have finally been getting therapy for the first time in my life the past several months (sometimes sporadically due to schedule chaos but mostly weekly) and it has been such a breath of fresh air. It has been extremely helpful for me in so many ways. It has been my constant outlet, my hour a week where I can cry (although I am still awful at constantly holding back my tears), my time where it is all about me and no one will call me dramatic or not good enough or anything like that.

It actually took me while to ask my mom to let me get help since she is a very judgmental and harsh person. But I finally did, less than a year ago, and I love my therapist so much. It is crystal clear to me and my therapist that I need this, and I have a long ways to go still. 

Unfortunately, due to my mother's habit of minimizing my problems and lack of understanding my needs, she has decided that therapy isn't, as she puts it, a ""long-term plan."" She doesn't want me to rely on therapy, whatever that means. Get too comfortable with it I guess. Part of it is because she sees therapy as something different than I do. I see it as a time and place to discuss my mental health, talk about my life, solve problems, make plans/goals, and learn about myself. She sees it as a place to work on myself, correct my behavioral issues. She actually told me before I started that my therapy would mostly be about correcting myself, and less about ""talking about my emotions."" It's almost like she saw my therapist as a third parent, another person to lecture me about all my wrongs.

Thank God she was wrong. There is no way I could handle that. I already have two parents and four older siblings who critique and lecture me constantly.

So, back to my mom's decision. Since I am only 17, I am underage and cannot receive any sort of counseling without my parent's consent, it is up to my mom. And she thinks that the end of this school year would be a nice, natural end as she calls it to therapy. She even tried to make me feel guilty/weird about thinking I would be doing more. 

This has been a massive stress in my life. I only have two more sessions left with her 'plan', and it's awful. I was practically sobbing two weeks ago during one of my meetings thinking about ending therapy so soon. I'm terrified. I have just barely started to feel better about myself, learn about the cause of my anxiety and depression, share some stuff I have never told anyone. And my mother just wants to take it away, as if she can decide and know that I don't need it anymore.

Last week, my therapist (we are currently meeting over Zoom calls) started out the session with saying that she had been thinking a lot about my situation and had talked with her supervisor and she told me that she didn't feel comfortable with ending therapy. She told me that she believes I am living in a toxic environment and by ending the one healthy outlet I have is not a good idea at all. (of course that then made me emotional to hear someone, a trained adult professional of all people, actually affirm me and not tell me I'm crazy.) She said that she wouldn't tell my mom that, but she plans to call her and talk to her about continuing my therapy. So far, I have not heard anything about a call between them, so she might call her this week.

Ultimately, I feel like my mom is set on ending therapy with no plans to resume it. While there still might be a chance it could continue, I am very unsure. Basically, the advice I am seeking is how to cope without much-needed therapy? I feel like I am going to slip into unhealthy habits when it is over. I just don't know how to deal with this. I'm lost and powerless."
Anxiety,How to reach out for help when your afraid to talk to people?? (especially about your problems),"Hi, 33M here. Just wondering it's been pointed out that I may have social anxiety and I'm starting to realize it. Like when I go to the store no small talk and I almost have to go to a set number of stores. I've become so introverted and quiet I can't seem to open up or talk about how shitty I feel with anyone. It's affecting my whole life and I'm alone because of it. I'm scared of being judged or lectured by doctors or mental health professionals. How do I reach out for help if I'm afraid to open up to the people close to me let alone strangers?"

They don’t just do this once every two hours, they do this all day and night.

Now it’s gotten a little far and he doesn’t want to do anything as he doesn’t want to worsen the situation as he doesn't know how these people will react to the footage. He’s wondering what steps to take with the following in mind:

\-there’s suddenly high water/electric bills these guys blame on him -these are relatives of the landlords father in law -the landlord was told by them he’s the one hearing things/or they’re just accidentally dropping things

My buddy is looking for a new place as a basement doesn’t suit him anyways but he wants to expose their behaviour. He’s scared he’ll worsen the situation if he shows the landlord the footage. What should he do?"

Anxiety,My mom might have an eating disorder??,"Hello, I’m currently 16. Basically, my mom has an obscure view on weight and has always been relatively skinny. She is always unsatisfied with her weight and is always on a form of diet and is obsessed with exercising. On her annual checkups, her health is excellent except for her weight which is  labeled as underweight. Currently she’s on a fasting (which she does sometimes when she noticed that she’s gained weight) and basically doesn’t eat for 2~4 days and only drinks water or coffee to fill her stomach. (No she is not religious) I’ve always been worried since the 6th grade (12y/o or maybe even younger) and Im back to worrying. The other day, my dad who is really concerned tried to make my mom give in to ice cream which she just got pissed at and is not talking to anymore. When she’s fasting, she’s always in a pissy mood and has short tempers (which is understandable as she’s not eating). I know that I cannot force her to eat and is stuck on not knowing what to do. It’s worse that we’re Asian because the Asian beauty/weight standards are really high. During her fasting, she will continue to do her daily workouts and I’m worried about her health. I probably should consult my mom and tell her about my worries but she’ll brush it off and say that she’s fat so there’s nothing to worry about. And I’m not sure I can’t tell a doctor? I’m not sure how that will work. Is there any tips or advices on how to help my mom or support my mom or I’m not sure...."

Anxiety,I am experiencing anxiety almost daily now.,"This is all my fault. Maybe that is cliche but recently I started writing down my thoughts. Eventually I went through a late night rabbit hole of writing down stuff and asking myself introspective questions.

This lead to me realizing some things about myself that were anxiety inducing. So while I've always had a fear of death, it would only cause me panic attacks every so often. Now I am fighting off anxiety - this fear - every day. It is awful. I have no idea what to do.

Before this my only major problem with anxiety was in social situations. But this is a whole new thing."
Anxiety,I had the worst panic attack of my life.,"Like the title says. I've had attacks before and was able to breathe through them but today was very different. I could feel it coming and would tell myself it wasn't a big deal and I could work through it. Then it hit me like a sack of bricks. 

My heart rate spiked and I couldn't breathe out of it. My hands started to go numb, then my legs went numb. Followed by my hands getting locked up and me being incapacitated on the ground. It lasted probably 10-15 minutes. I thought I was having a stroke.

I'm done living like this and am getting help through a caregiver this week."
Anxiety,Does anyone feel better at night or during dark/rainy days)?,"Difficult to explain, but it's as if the night/dark/inclement weather provides a cloak or cape for me to escape and my anxiety subsides for a bit. Or maybe the night is simply an indication that the day's stresses are finally coming to an end.

Interested in seeing if people experience this, or maybe the exact opposite."

To the point where I began thinking I might have GAD. Today I got my regular blood test done for my thyroid, since I have hypothyroidism, and it turns out I need to adjust my medication."

Anxiety,"TW: Pet Death --- My partner and I have a 4 m.o. puppy, and I already have anxiety about when he will pass.","TW: Death of a Pet

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and I picked up our goldendoodle puppy in early March, and let me start by saying I love him so, so much, and overall, he has helped with my GAD, especially with the current state of the world. At the end of the day though, all I can think about is if I'm going to do something that's going to be a potentially fatal mistake for the puppy, or how horrible it's going to be when it's his time to cross over the rainbow bridge in (hopefully) 12-15 years from now. In regards to the worries that I'm going to somehow hurt/kill my pup, I thought I would feel better now that he's all up to date with his heartworm &amp; flea/tick medications, as well as vaccinations, but now I've just moved on to how scared I am of him dying years from now.  I'm trying to stay mindful and in the moment, but I'm definitely struggling, and it sucks, because it's taking away from enjoying my sweet puppy now. Does/has anyone struggled with something like this with their animal? If so, how did you manage it?

Anxiety,I told my parents I had bad anxiety,They said that it’s normal and every teenager has some anxiety and said to just get over it and I’m not going to get any help. My anxiety isn’t as bad as some people’s posts I’ve read and I still feel like I’m faking it even though I always feel like everyone hates me
Anxiety,Why Does It Make You Feel Like Your Dying !,"I Have Heart Paps , get shaky heart racing , chest aches sometimes not every time and it just feels like irregular heart beats and skips I hate it so much even as I’m laying here taking regular breaths of air on my back I can still see my heart pumping thru my t shirt I want this to go away I have anxiety attacks everyday all day long &amp; idk how to control them or what to do to minimize them from happening they just come out of no where 🤧"
Anxiety,i'm scared to make phone calls,i don't know why this started to happened to me but every time i got to make a phonecall i just feel so anxious and on the verge of having a panic attack
Anxiety,How do I deal with my driving anxiety?,"I recently got my permit and my dad has been taking me driving. The first time went well, the second time went much worse, and the third time we had to go back home because I 'needed to use the bathroom' but instead I cried on the seat for a good five minutes. I hate driving. It's so stressful and even driving around an empty parking lot gets me anxious. I feel nervous just thinking about it, and I'm going to drive with my dad in five hours. Does anyone have any tips?"
Anxiety,My new experience with reddit!,"I have recently joined reddit, and am finding it a little unnerving but I am forcing myself to find a voice here. The thing that makes me slightly anxious is that I am putting my opinions online for everyone to see and comment on. I have always been very worried of what people say about me, but I am trying to be less anxious about the repercussions and let it slide, hopefully I will see some progress in my mindset. I feel more comfortable posting here because I am reassured that others are going through similar feelings of anxiety :)"
Anxiety,Heart attack symptoms or just bad anxiety attack,So I’m laying in bed on my back and my heart is beating all kinds of crazy making me feel funny then I noticed I started feeling a pain on the left side of my head then on the right side then back to the left and my neck started to hurt but my chest isn’t cramped up but my left arm feels a little funny my neck doesn’t hurt anymore but my heart is still racing slightly but my head hurts over my left eye and I’m dehydrated and my left arm is kinda crampy but it’s gone now as well should I be worried or should I just relax and let it pass over ?
Anxiety,Sudden irrational fear,"Ive never had anxiety around bugs in the past. But earlier today i saw a silverfish on the wall, and i have had so much anxiety all day. They come every year during this time, and it is always annoying, but they are harmless so its normally whatever. But today ive been so afraid to do anything because of them and im not sure why. I have sat curled in a chair reading/scrolling through reddit, too nervous to move to another room. I have no clue why im suddenly so afraid of them. Anyone else develope sudden anxiety like this? Does it usually last an entire day? Or should i talk to someone about it?

For reference i have always suffered from anxiety but i haven't felt this nervous in years. All over a bug :/"
Anxiety,Whenever i make a mistake i feel like absolute shit for ages,Even the slightest one. Especially it it annoys someone else. Rn im drinking because my gf is mad at me for helping her friend when she said she was good.
Anxiety,Small to Moderate problems feel like the end of the world/ Bring on a Need to Escape,"Hi all,   
I am a 27 year old female diagnosed with GAD and MDD. I work full time and am also in school to become a clinical mental health counselor (ironic, huh?). I see a therapist Bi-Monthly and take medications for anxiety and depression. I seem to be in a place right now where I begin to spiral if anything in my life goes wrong. For example, this week, I finally came to terms with the fact that my dog needs some serious training (I believe he has anxiety and is also reactive towards a number of things). Rather than approaching this with a logical frame of reference, I am finding myself completely down, upset, angry, and am having crying spells. I have had multiple panic attacks and yelled at my spouse. I am going to worst case scenario saying that my dog is not going to get better, is going to get worse, all of it is our fault, and we are ultimately going to have to find him a new home. My appetite is 0 and I can barely focus on work without looking at training videos and harping on everything. We are seeing a behavioral vet this Friday, but knowing that I've taken the right steps for the situation and accepting there is nothing else I can do right now is not realistic for me. It leaves me feeling like I want to pack up my car and run away. I don't feel capable of handling challenges like this on top of my other responsibilities. It's frustrating and I just feel so defeated outside of obviously feeling very anxious."
Anxiety,Can’t stop crying and I don’t know why.,Hey. Has anyone ever experienced this? I’ve dealt with anxiety for almost 8 years and have had some ups and downs for sure but nothing like this.
Anxiety,Hi anyone feeling like talking ? or feeling alone ?,chat with me if you want someone to talk .
Anxiety,Anybody else experience a breathing issue like this?,"I'm usually used to the kind of symptoms that my anxiety generates for me, but the past couple days I've experienced what I think is another one, but I'm not positive.

Throughout the day, I am constantly reminded of my breathing. For whatever reason, I have this thought that if I don't consciously breathe, my mind will ""forget"" to do it. I keep thinking that I'm about to be short of breath, but I always manage to take in a satisfying deep breath when that thought occurs. But then this cycle continues throughout the day with little abatement.

I keep telling myself that this is likely just another symptom of anxiety, but then of course my mind goes ""what if it's not?"" My mind immediately jumps to covid or asthma or some allergic reaction I don't know I have.

My question is: has anyone else experienced a feeling similar to this? And were you able to get an answer as to what caused it (and better yet, were you able to make it go away!) Thank you so much!"
Anxiety,I failed my math class because I was too afraid of it,"Like the title says, I failed my math class this year because I was too anxious to actually do it. (I'm in college, btw.) It sounds like a cop out, I know, but I just couldn't face it. I missed the final test which was yesterday. My mom has been telling me to study and practice but I feel like I really can't. Last year I was doing good and getting my homework done on time and keeping decent grades, now I'm barely keeping my head above water. I feel like my anxiety and depression replaced who I really am and I feel like I can't escape either, let alone both."
Anxiety,A change in mind!,"Alright folks. 
You ever feel like you’re gonna die? How you’re just gonna drop dead? About 95% of you here, right?
Well, I’m still sorta like that. So paranoid about this &amp; that. “What if I have a heart attack, or a stroke” 
Well, lemme just tell you, anxiety mimics a lot of things. A change in mind, a different mind set, or logical thinking is what you need to remember during a intense panic attack. 
This is what I tell myself, 
I’m young, healthy, I eat right &amp; exercise. 
My arteries ARENT clogged. I don’t smoke, I literally used to get my blood tested every 4 weeks cause of my silly mind playing tricks on me. I’m always more than fine.  Get this, I’m barely even 19 &amp; worried about life. 
But the world isn’t out to get me, just as the worlds not out to get you! &amp; it’s not really a life if you’re always stressing. 
Practice meditation, which I recently started. And hello? Where have you
Been my entire life. 
You’re gonna be ok- 
You’re gonna make it-
If no ones there to reassure you- 
Do it yourself- you do know yourself better than anyone else after all!"
Anxiety,For those that suffer from Anxiety after drinking. How many?,"I get pretty bad anxiety the day after I drink. Obviously the more drinks, the worse the anxiety is. For those that suffer from anxiety after drinking, is there a number of drinks that you can have and not feel it the next day? For example, if I have 3 or more I am pretty anxious the next day. 1-2 drinks seem to not affect me too much the following day. Curious everyone’s thoughts."
Anxiety,I’m (20f) going to try leave the house tomorrow,"Hey everyone! Just a short post, I’ve been suffering with what was crippling anxiety but now more manageable anxiety for about two months. In the beginning stages I was hospitalised as it was thought me going blind and my uncontrollable shaking from this massive panic attack was a seizure. That really kicked off my crippling anxiety. I didn’t shower for two weeks as whenever I stood up or moved my heart would pound and my ears would ring, i’d also feel like an elephant was standing on my chest and feel short of breath. So I stayed in bed for weeks, I’ve now been showering with almost no problems whatsoever just a palpitation here and there I guess from worry and I can walk around the house and forgot for the most part my heart is beating really fast and other minor symptoms. It was a VERY slow progression day by day but I done it!

I haven’t left the house in this whole two months, the doctor things my heart thudding could be from where I haven’t left my house and got no exercise so the slightest movement makes my heart rate go high. My resting heart rate in hospital was between 80-115 and I’m not sure but I think it’s actually gone down know, I didn’t realise anxiety could effect your resting heart rate. But I’m seriously worried about it I go for a walk how high is my heart rate going to go? Am i going to faint? If my resting HR can be 115 it means my exercise HR can go up to 190 ish~ which is heading for a heart attack zone, I’m pretty worried and I’d probably have a panic attack if I knew I didn’t HAVE to go but I REALLY want to! Please any advice would be helpful, I’m just so scared about my heart rate rocketing and I have another severe episode and end up back to square one"
Anxiety,Elephant,Do you ever feel like there is sitting an elephant on your chest because I have been feeling that for weeks and today was so bad because I found out about some things. I feel like the elephant will never get off of me and I hate it so much I want them off.
Anxiety,Sleep Anxiety,"For the past few weeks, every night before bed I am scared at the thought of sleeping. i lie down and tell myself. I do this everyday. it’s good for me. it’s healthy and natural. but i guess the feeing of being out of control freaks me out. Fainting is a big fear of mine, and i guess i just have this fear of not being in control. i went to be late last night and woke up early and wasn’t able to go back to sleep, and it’s finals week right now. I’m really freaked out by my weird fear of sleeping (usually i love naps and always seize opportunity to sleep) and was wondering if anyone had any advice on why this could have suddenly developed or how i could relax a bit lore before it gets worse."
Anxiety,Can anyone help?,"Does OCD really just latch onto anything and come up with horrible and weird thoughts?

So I’m watching boardwalk empire and all of a sudden a girl gets beaten up by her husband and then the main character brings her flowers in hospital and the first thing that popped into my head was “what makes people be kind” doesn’t sound a bad thought but then I question “what if everyone isn’t kind and really are evil” and like when you hear about how people are helping out their elderly neighbours during this pandemic I question “they could easily rob those old people but why are they being nice and giving them groceries?” Is this OCD or is it life OCD, Existential OCD? Anyone got any idea or has anyone had thoughts like this?

Thanks"
