depression,"Lack of cooperation from people: being left out. Most people do not want to get to know me. How to resolve? This is a repeat situation. Ignoring me. Is really hard in jobs Because I need cooperation from coworkers. How to resolve?

In the coffee a bit, hospital a bit, school a lot (because I spent more time), jobs a lot, shop. How to deal with this? I have suffering all my life because people seem to not find me interesting."
depression,"I hate to sleep I can’t sleep, and I haven’t been sleeping for a long time, each night I tried I spent hours staring into the ceiling frightened by my thoughts. I can’t get out of it no matter how hard I tried to shift my focus elsewhere. I wish I could have a person to talk to but I don’t know how to talk anymore nor having the will to vent. I have nowhere to go, I just hope this will end soon."
depression,Just another day folks! Let’s fucking wrap it up and do it all over again in 5 hours. FUCK
depression,"My house is a sad place It’s been made for business and efficiency leaving out light and warmth.
Its like the cold outside this house.
And the people in it are frostbitten with angst, loneliness and sadness.

I can hear everything going on in this house.
Yet somehow that just exacerbates its cold isolation. 
Its split up and the only time people speak to eachother is when they have to.
I’d burn it down if I could and move away.
Maybe into a nice warm cottage.
And we’d be a better family there, I know that to be true.

But we’re tethered to its presence.
Always making a return.
Forgetting the past in an instant, of warmth and unity.
To live day by day alone depressed angry and with beaten down purity."
depression,"I just want to die I just hate my life. I need to numb myself and act constantly to keep on going.
I’m lonely, I have no one, no friends, nothing. Only a bf who treats me like an accessory and that I haven’t seen in 2 months. 
I feel like people just use you and abuse you until they drain you and then just laugh at you. They rob you while destroying you. You cannot trust anyone. The world is a horrible place."
depression,Have you reach out to your family/parents for help? any advice? I have no father/mother. And the only one i could think of reaching out is my uncle. I'm kind of scared. I don't want them to get weird towards me or throwaway my feelings.
depression,"I don't even know why I'm crying anymore Is it for the people I miss being in my life

The person I wish I was

The things I wish I had

All of them at once

I don't know anymore. It's a sunny Saturday morning and I just can't stop crying"
depression,I keep crying for help but there’s no answer Please hear me. Can anyone please fucking hear me. I keep crying and it falls on deaf ears. Maybe it’s intentional at this point and i’ve worn it dry.
depression,"Never anyone available Is it just me or does it seem like when you need  an ear, your 'friends ' are never available???"
depression,"idk how to handle my feelings right now I'm starting to feel inadequate in my relationship. I love my wife with all my heart and trust her fully. Lately I feel attention hungry and unfulfilled.  I have 0 feelings on infidelity at all. But we've been drinking lately.... and not doing anything after almost making plans too it seems. I'm not mad at her but this takes me for a Rollercoaster.  I feel rejected 😞  I feel a severe lack of attention at this points and just feeling like drowning myself in more liquor.... this morning she taunted me with ""making plans tonight"" I didn't make the first move so nothing happened..  I'm depressed about this cycle but it's only making the cycle repeat. She's gone to bed without saying she loved me. I'm sitting on the couch drunk and fucking depressed.  Fml I hate this so fucking much. I just want her attention."
depression,"Some of you are out of line. I just saw a post about a kid who’s reaching out and y’all called him stupid and an idiot.   And downvoted his explanations.   GTFOH!!!!
You might respond well to chastisement and maybe that helps you but many of us don’t need anybody else to make us feel any worse than what we say to ourselves.    You must have no real idea what depression really is.   And how fragile people are.   I am so freaking mad.   What if this kid was saying something meaningless to you but it meant the world to him/her and you pushed them too far?    I know this is Reddit but this page is for hurting people.   Just get out and don’t come back"
depression,"I feel so alone So tonight I was really struggling and I decided to call the suicide hotline. The call already started off not the greatest because she kept telling me to hold on. And then when I did start talking she kept speaking over me. The call ended with me basically getting hung up on. She said I had exceeded my time limit even though Google said there wasn’t one, that’s the whole reason I called. I just wanted to be able to talk because it’s been getting so bad I started writing a note. I just feel like even the people who claim to want to help don’t really want to. 

It’s left me feeling so alone that I just don’t think it’s worth it to try anymore. It took me so long to get the courage to call and now I just feel bad for even trying to get help. It’s so hard to no think this way too, I just feel like no matter how hard I try it’s never enough. I’m not sure what to do now. If anyone knows how to go from here, even if it’s just new self care thing for me to do or positive affirmations to say I’ll take it. I’m just at a loss now because now I feel like there’s actually no one."
depression,"I'm so tired. I'm tired of acting like I'm ok. I'm tired of pretending to care what happens. I'm so damn tired of trying. But at the end of the day, I'll just grin and bare it. Go to work and keep putting on the fake smile."
depression,Deeply depressed Things that normally bring me happiness only make me feel numb or I don’t even want to make art for example. I’m failing my courses right now and I feel very alone. My eating habits haven’t been great either.
depression,"My mom got angry at me because I hit myself She even threw a sarcastic ""hit yourself harder""comment in there.

It's only when I held a knife to my throat a few years ago that she was like ""don't do it!"" but other than that my family constantly belittles me and my struggles. It's easy to say that you care about a mentally ill person until they start acting mentally ill. 

I think I should commit to offing myself just to spite them. Maybe they'll wish you themselves that they understood me a little bit more."
depression,Everybody talks about strict dads having pretty daughters (vice versa) but nobody talks about strict dads having depressed daughters. Depressed girls either have strict dads or no dads at all lol
depression,"art pains have almost killed me. i don't know what else to do i have been slamming my head into walls and my desk, i have been punching walls until i at least draw blood, i have been punching myself in the gut until i at least bruise a little, and it's all because of two things. because of art problems, and because of my failure to kill myself in 2016.

i made the right call back then. i knew i would deteriorate into a clockwork husk if i didn't die when i should've. but then i had to continue, and everything had to get worse when i realized how incapable i am of the only things i want.

and i had to find that strange reflection. that person who's my age, can do all the things i've imagined doing, is disturbingly similar to me and my own ideas, is what i can only determine the version of me who didn't fail. i can't even consider the ideas my own anymore. i should've been like them.

well, even though that continues to cripple my spirit, earlier this year i tried to push past and get the ball rolling with drawing. and what a surprise, it went nowhere because i don't have the passion. i'm not capable of art in any regard.

this is it dude, i'm not cut out for any of it. i had my chances to grow into anything significant whatsoever and i blew them all. i could have been so much, and it torments me thinking of if i got to execute my ideas first. my free time is dwindling, and i'm melting into a useless drone. and even if by some freak turn of events i were to somehow gain the passion i lack and move forward with drawing, it would take years before it'd be anywhere worth witnessing. i don't know what to do, the only thing i can think of is just biting the bullet. life is just punishing me for my fuck up in 2016. i should've been dead already.

i think i got the point across. i don't think i ever failed to get the point across. it's just that no one fucking cares about these problems, and nothing can fucking fix them."
depression,I can’t sleep again It’s 4 am. I can’t sleep. My brain is getting carried away with negative thoughts. What do you do when things are like this?
depression,"Is there or has there ever actually been a point? I'm not going to draw this out. For a long time, I've been the problem in my own life. I make a series of bad decisions and suffer the consequences for them.

After years of therapy and self-actualization, I finally got it. It finally made sense to me how awful I've been to the people that I claimed to love. Yet, what difference does it make? Those people aren't going to come back. Those decisions can't be unmade. And at the end of the day, you're left with this crippling realization that the misery you feel is what you have always deserved.


So what is the point? Why not just die? Why persist if it's just misery? On top of that, I feel like my job as a paramedic has ruined my ability to feel most emotions but sadness and desolation. I can't sleep anymore. I constantly feel on edge. I feel as though my whole life is a nightmare.


At this point. Life seems so pointless. I'm unloved and unhappy and I feel this is what I deserve. So what exactly is the fucking point?"
depression,"I told my boyfriend that he shouldn’t date me because I have severe depression. I relapsed and now he regrets it. This is a throwaway so I’ll probably delete this later…

After relapsing into self harm, my boyfriend confronted me and told me not to do that because we promised we’d work on it; it being my depression and coping skills. It didn’t bother me that he was reminding me of this promise, but the way he told me made me feel so small, like my depression was nothing more than a nuisance that he had to deal with. After months of genuinely caring about his feelings whenever he’s stressed out or at his lowest, his response to my stress was always “You promised you’d work on this.”

I know I promised. That doesn’t mean all the bad days will go according to plan. His whole spiel got me spiraling and I completely shut down. I started dissociating and he kept pushing saying “Why does it always end up this way? Why are you being like this?” My anxiety peaked and I just couldn’t listen to it anymore. I walked away from the situation and cried.

After having an anxiety attack, I could hear him in the other room say, “I’m over this.”

It’s so great for non-depressed people to be able to choose when they can and want to deal with it and when they don’t care anymore. But us depressed people have to wake up and find a way to cope every fucking day.

So much shit had gone on this month that affected both me and my boyfriend, but since I have the depression, I was still grieving over the events that occurred.

I’m so fucking tired of trying to cope just so that the people around me can feel comfortable. Just let me be not okay for today. Is that too much to ask? It’s tiring to keep trying to learn to cope properly when for your whole life you never knew how. Let me be sad and grieve. Let me feel stressed out. Working on things doesn’t mean I stop feeling these feelings.

I love him, but this is something that really makes me want to breakup with him. I warned him that my depression gets bad sometimes and he still wanted to date me. And before anyone tells me to just breakup with him, I can’t just pack up and leave. I’d be homeless if I did. I’m stuck dealing catering to his feelings rather that feel my own."
depression,"Why bother continuing? I just know I’m going to fail at life. I’m 21, I have no job, no money, $3k in debt. And the worst part is this won’t be my lowest. Life is only going to get tougher and more stressful. I know I will have to go through much greater challenges in the future so why bother? If I can’t handle this, how am I going to handle what happens next?"
depression,"How to know when therapy is not working? Hey y’all,

I’ve been seeing a therapist now for almost a year. She’s given me a few techniques to cope with my OCD, but now she wants me to work on processing my feelings. I’m not sure if I should stay with her. I have no reference for how long these things take to feel better, but I had two therapists before her, and she seems like the most knowledgeable one. She was the first one to actually diagnose me with anxiety, depression, and OCD. She tells me that therapy is like pulling things out of a drawer, cleaning up and throwing away what’s not needed, and then putting things back, but she says I’m still at the point where we are still taking things out.

I’m not sure what to do because I’m feeling worse than ever before and it feels like I should have been feeling better by now. Any advice?"
depression,"I am 21 years old now and I still act how I did at 15 Nothing has changed really. I wouldn't say I hate my life I just hate how my life has progressed. Wake up,play games,sleep. And repeat I simply don't enjoy many things anymore and I'm starting to realize I hate my mother for what she has done to me and I've realized for a long time I don't belong to this family and I just want to not be in this house anymore"
depression,"I need help I never knew this subreddit existed, and I wouldn't be posting on here if I didn't feel desperate...

My life has been in a consistent downward spiral that is a mixture if mistakes and bad luck, mixed with mental blocks that prevent me from opening up. I feel like I have to give context and explain myself and even then I feel guilty for venting.

I am a 90s male and I was raised to believe as a male I should be able to overcome my own hardships. If I cry or show weakness then...well then I'm weak and not a man. I've held onto this concept for a very long time and I'm bursting at the seams, I feel weak, and I'm cracking more and more every day. 

I was sexually abused as a child and I never felt like I could ever talk about it. Last year I finally had enough money for therapy and my councilor made me feel worse about my issues, she literally said I deserved to be there and thank God I don't think of harming anyone other then myself...needless to say I haven't gone to therapy since. 

I grew up with a single mother in a poor household, we used ti eat buttered toast or peanut butter and crackers for a meal. The same person who abused me abused my sister and I would be forced to listen to it. Sometimes she would come and hide in my bed only for her to be dragged out of my room.

As I got older I became selfish and reclusive. I feel in some ways it made me stronger and better. I can be charismatic and make good impressions on ppl but it feels superficial most of the time. I struggle to fully relate and this is all really vague. I'm sorry for that I don't want this post to be so very long.

I have two close friends but I'm starting to realize they are not as close as I had hoped. I can't open up to then without judgment, i can't talk to my sister about our abuse bc I cannot handle it without breaking down. My mom loves us but at the same time won't do anything to help...

I feel lost, I keep making bad decisions. I drink regularly, I seek out strangers online but I struggle to open up. I guess I don't know the point of this. I'm sad, I'm alone, I no longer know what to do."

depression,"dropped my medication cold turkey 'just to see' and now I kind of don't want to exist again So, I have been on Effexor and Wellbutrin for a while now and they've been working. I mean, it's not like I pop them pills and suddenly I'm wearing rose-tinted glasses but I am definitely doing better than *without* the meds.

I was still struggling with things the antidepressants seemed unable to touch though so I was actively trying to get a diagnosis for ADHD or OCD because those seemed the most likely given my struggles. But haha fun times, it would seem that I am just autistic. A lot of the symptoms of ADHD, OCD, and Asperger's overlap so I could have all three but either way, medication for one can sometimes help the other. No cure obviously but being able to tackle everyday things like eating and... bathing and like, I dunno, talking to someone more than once a month would be nice so my doc put me on Adderall to help me focus and get shit done.

I was under the impression that Adderall was like a magic pill though, ya know? Like I would take it and fly around at lightspeed or something but nope, the effects were generally unnoticeable to me. I started doing some research and found that a lot of people said that Effexor seemed to lessen the effects of their ADHD meds.

SO I GOT THIS FUN THOUGHT and it was 'maybe what you thought was depression and anxiety was actually just your wonky brain doing its thing and now that you know that, you could learn how to work around it' and so... I dropped my antidepressants cold turkey just to see lol. I figured I could handle the withdrawal side effects because I already feel like crap most days but what I wasn't prepared for were the emotions.

All I can do right now is laugh because this is so dumb. In as short as one week I already want to kill myself again. I already want to self-harm. I hate myself and I hate everyone else. My insomnia has kicked in again and I had to dig out my sleeping meds which I haven't had to touch in a long ass time. And I just feel so absolutely horrible. I feel so hopeless just like before and I hate it. Hate hate hate it.

But now I am worried that these feelings are just the mental part of the withdrawal symptoms and if I put myself back on the meds I won't be able to see if Adderall by itself is enough. Because that's really all I wanted to see. I wanted to see if addressing the ADHD symptoms was enough to make day-to-day life livable. I thought my self-loathing stemmed from my inability to dedicate myself to things I know I loved so I thought that if I could just address that by itself then everything else would fall into place.

But I just don't know. Is this the withdrawal talking or is this my good friend depression rising from the ashes? I just don't want to be on meds if I don't need them and if I stayed on all these meds then apparently my blood pressure could skyrocket and overall just... if I don't need them then I want to know that.

What do you all think? Should I start taking them again or continue to tough it out? This is so dumb I am so dumb. and yes I sent my doctor a message addressing this stupid decision of mine but the first appointment available to actually talk to her isn't until the end of December."
depression,"Can’t get over abuse I’m 21f and just got out of a terrible 4 year relationship 4 months ago. I almost died from physical abuse. And yet he gets to go on with his life and be happy with no real consequences. I want to get over it but I just can’t. I think about how much of my life I lost, how fucked up of a situation I’m in in every aspect of my life because of the way this person treated me. I lost everything because I got so depressed I couldn’t maintain my life anymore. And it makes me sad cause I used to be so smart and so far ahead of everyone I ever met. Then became an alcoholic and everything got so fucked. Now that it’s over, im 3 months sober and I spend every waking minute trying to fix the damage and get my life to where I want it to be. But im so hurt and no one ever wants to hear me talk about it"
depression,"Symptom advice (physical exhaustion) Hello,

I'm currently afflicted by an illness but don't know exactly what it is. In brief, I got very strong exhaustion after overworking myself for months and contracting a virus. The exhaustion has been lasting for six weeks. I have heard that depression or burnout can have similar symptoms. I know reddit is no substitute for a doctor, but I would be very thankful to hear people's experiences with physical exhaustion and depression or burnout.


My symptoms are as follows:
I am generally very low on energy, and every time I exercise in any way, like cycling, I get completely exhausted after. It's not just the lack of energy, it's the fact that I literally feel more sick after exercise, such that I have to lie down and rest for hours. Is this common in depression or burnout as well or is it merely the lack of energy to do things?


Thanks a lot for your help."
depression,"In a few days, I will ask a girl out for the first time ever in my life (uh-oh). I will keep things short because I have a tendency to ramble.

Let's call them both Sara and Amy.

Met them 6 weeks ago as they are on my course. The tutor was giving handbooks out so as I was going to the front to get mine and I told them both who were sitting close that I would also get them one. When I gave it to them, one of the girls (Amy) asked Sara to ask me for my name. I told them and we started chatting as a group of 3. I got their numbers instantly as I was looking to make friends etc.

Fast forward 6 weeks, all 3 of us hang out everywhere in Uni, we went to a cafe and played games for hours once and got hot chocolate, we went to a social event that the uni hosted on another night.

Me and Amy have been texting a lot. She's very shy (in her words) and is very hard to read sometimes. Like, she is extremely engaged sometimes and then also cold and distant. She is incredibly sweet and I was considering asking her out (casual and cliche, like milkshakes and movie).

My worries are this:

We are in a friend group of 3. I talk to Amy more, but I talk to Sara a lot too. I don't feel ""in the friend zone"" as I haven't been too available. I flirt with her and she reciprocates. However, sometimes I don't know if she knows that I'm flirting, so maybe she just responds to me.

We were sitting in class the other day and Sara says to me and Amy that ""we are getting too comfortable as a 3"" and ""wanted to meet new people"". Me and Amy are very similar and both prefer smaller groups, more intimate settings (we both don't drink, party etc, enjoy our own space.)

This set alarm bells in my head, as I didn't want to lose my chance with Amy in a group dynamic. They were at Sara's accommodation the other week and Sara was with her group of friends and introduced one of her friends to Amy (let's call him Luke) and they apparently all baked cookies together. The other day we were walking and Sara was telling me about their next plans to bake things and jokingly said to Amy about her and Luke and told me ""Amy and Luke are dating"" (even though they had only met once) and almost immediately Amy turned to me and said ""No, we're not!"". This made me think that she didn't want me to think she was off-the-market.

Anyway, I find myself in another dilemma.

\&gt; I feel me and Amy get on incredibly well. I try and flirt with her, and she is sometimes flirty back. I'm worried because of how hard she is to read if she is just being friendly or not.

\&gt; It's just us 3. The ""friend dynamic"" may have already prevented me from getting to know Amy on a romantic level. However, she is sweet and geeky and seems very warm around me, so I don't know.

\&gt; There may be another guy, but it seemed that Sara was just teasing, and Amy quickly dismissed it. But I can't say. I need to make my move before they start getting anywhere. I feel that Sara is the more pushy one, and Amy is very laid-back.

I feel like this is a genuine chance with a girl that I've never had before. I am extremely sarcastic around Amy and she totally gets my humor and responds in kind. Now, I may just be mistaking friendship for something more? She can be very chatty both in-person and by text... but also very cold. She has told me though that she's shy and sometimes doesn't know what to say to people (she isn't the 'talker') so I feel that this explains her coldness sometimes.

Here's my plan. I am going to wait until Thursday (our last class of the week) and ask her as she is walking back to her student building (so we are both alone). That way if I am rejected, I won't see her for 2 weeks as we are having a uni break, and we'd have a bit of space between the awkward rejection and meeting again. I am going to say something like:

""Hey Amy, could I ask for your opinion on something? So I met this girl 6 weeks ago. She's pretty nice, and I want to get to know her better, and I'm interested in asking her out. The thing is, I don't know if I am way off and I don't want to put her on the spot as she is hard to read and I don't want to be the guy who has misread the situation. I was wondering if she'd be interested in maybe meeting up one night. Just casual, like seeing a movie and going for shakes? Nothing big. But before I ask her, I want to know if that sounds like something she'd be interested in""

I am going to make it painfully obvious that I am talking about her. We spend all of our university time together and she knows that I find her hard to read. Our humor works well and I feel she'd understand who I'm talking about.

We are both incredibly sarcastic though. So I need to drive the point that I am being sincere to her.

What do you guys think? Any advice? I need to act now, as I am guilty of playing things too cool and waiting to long and missing my chances... or I rush in and creep them out.

Ugh, I need to escape this hell. I need to put myself on the line and be vulnerable."
depression,"Depressed, I guess? I've lived with depression all my life. So much so that I'm pretty sure I've developed persistent depression disorder because nothing brings me joy anymore. I've been unmedicated for almost a year because I can't afford to go to the doctor.

Anyway. One of my coworkers asked me to be a bridesmaid in their wedding and I'm honored. But the depressed part of me is like, why? Why me? I'm the fucking worst. 

Idk why people like me. I shouldn't be alive but I know that I can't off myself. I hate this game my brain is playing."

depression,"i can’t get up to go to the bathroom Right now I’m in college and living in a dorm. Going to the bathroom is such an ordeal for me. For one thing my dorm is really far from the bathroom on my floor. I can’t move off campus because there’s literally nowhere to go around here and you need to get special approval to live off campus. I’m constantly neglecting my personal hygiene (lol, remember that one?) and avoiding using the bathroom at all. It’s especially problematic when I’m on my period and it ends up causing me physical pain because I can’t get up to use the bathroom. I really wish I could get a room with a bathroom but because of my PTSD I also need a single. Also it’s halfway into the semester. But I’ve become completely dysfunctional and I don’t know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice. I feel like I’m losing it."

I take words very seriously so when he insulted me during our breakup, I took it so badly and I’ve been spiraling down, I don’t see any hope in my life. I don’t even know if he’s a narc or if I’m the one that pushed him to say all those mean things. He said that it’s reactive abuse. I never abused him, I always spoke to him with love and respect.

depression,"How to talk about sensitive things without crying? I just cannot talk about emotions or anything slightly related to them without bawling. 

I will give you an example. My professor called me into her office the other day to ask why my class participation was non-existent. She actually had to guide me and ask if I found others intimidating or had anxiety and all I said was: ""a little"". And I had a whole flood of tears in my throat and I would have bawled if she probed me but thankfully she didn't. I wanted to open up. I wanted to talk. But even in a situation that was kept light in mood (by her), I wanted to cry. 

How do I not do that? I wasn't like this before. I've always kept things to myself and now that I want to open up I can't because I will cry hysterically like a mad person. Funny thing is I can't bring myself to cry otherwise. I'm completely dry when I'm on my own."
depression,"Can’t figure out if what I’m feeling stems from selfishness I usually get procrastinated by thoughts of how im feeling, which doubles as a coping method for me fsr. But lately, ive been thinking has all this happened because i was just selfish. For months ive felt nothing but irritation, jealousy, and overall a worse person. So if im just being selfish, do i even deserve to feel this way, do i deserve to get validated, or am i just a selfish narcissist that did nothing but hurt others?"

Currently my mum is potentially dying and my dad is a drug user abusing my sisters mentally every day the same as what happened to me growing up with heroin addicts for parents.

I have moved about 100 miles away but am still plagued with it,

I couldn't even sit my exams because I was never in school, I was so scared I would come home and find one of them dead from overdose, or even worse one had killed the other, I actually stopped my dad slitting my mums throat when I was about 10, I barely remember my childhood other than the bad stuff because my brain has blocked it out.

So then I started taking drugs myself at 15 and went into rehab at 20 years old, I fixed my drug issues but swapped for alcohol, exactly like my mother, but I am not her.

Right now I am living with my girlfriend, she owns the house and I pay her a very small amount of rent, except I barely do because it seems she just pays it for me, I am supposed to be running a videography business but I can't even find clients because once she leaves and I am in my' one true self I don't want to do anything but procrastinate, think and cry, I am genuinely on the edge I just need a quick solution to feeling like my whole life was set up to fuck me:("

depression,"My bf has depression, idk what do to I (F, 24) have been with me bf (M, 27) for 1.5 years now. My boyfriend got cheated by his ex girlfriend which almost destroyed him, he lost all his friends due to the fact that they stayed in contact with his ex although they were his friends and not hers and he gained 10+ kg since we are together. He feels like a loser and over the past months he unlearned to be around people. It’s like having a 5-10 minute conversation with someone is exhausting him. BUT he doesn’t talk about it. He never tells me how much he suffers and instead he makes jokes about everything. We barely have serious conversations because he just doesn’t like to argue or to express his feelings. So, two days ago, I confronted him. I needed him to be serious for one time. I needed to know what is going on in his mind and he confessed that he is depressed and that he would have killed himself long time ago if I wasn’t in his life and if he didn’t know for sure that it would destroy his family, especially his mom. We talked about that he hates his study and that he wants to quit and that he knows we are starting to have different life goals if he doesn’t finish Uni and that I have to decide if I want to stay with him. I love my boyfriend so much, I can’t live without him but he is making me unhappy. I barely enjoy anything anymore because I know that he isn’t happy but I can’t break up. How am I supposed to break up if I still love him so much and now since I know that he is having suicidal thoughts. I feel helpless because I want to be with him, I want to share my life with him but he is not able to feel these highs with, he is not able to express any deeper love and he is basically giving up on himself. 

If anymore was in the position of my boyfriend - how did you manage? How can I help him? Can I help him?"
depression,"I just want to scream and run away from this life. I’m so tired of everything. I want to escape. I want to be able to sleep all day and not have to deal with anyone anymore. I want no responsibilities and I want peace. I’m tired of worrying about things all the time and I want to shut my brain off.

I feel so useless and I feel like I don’t deserve love because all I do is hurt people unintentionally. I don’t want to hurt people anymore. It would be better for everyone if I didn’t exist."
depression,"Told my mom I wanted to commit suicide and she agreed it would be for the best. My life in a pretty shit place and I stay with my mom for whatever reason my mom never has been in a situation to give advice she over came a lot of adversity and I always found it to be extremely annoying she can't give any advice at all I even had to teach myself how to drive and spent many days and night alone. 


Now I've been homeless a couple times I have a gambling problem and it makes it hard for me to maintain money a couple weeks before my birthday she told me to leave she wanted me out but I knew I didn't have the money to leave so I was just gonna kill myself being homeless 3 times and the amount of debt I'm in my outlook on life pretty bad while this conversation went on I told my mom how I truly felt about how she's never beem able to give me any type of advice saying she regret having me when I was a really small child and why on earth after all that why wouldn't she be able to give me advice on at least some of the Simplist things in life? I also said I had been thinking of killing myself since I was 6 growing up in a household where the one person who normally cares for you can't even say they love you took a huge toll on me mentally making me hate myself cause why else wouldn't my own mom like me. So I also told her I was planning to kill myself this month and she said maybe that would be for the best. I was extremely sad and it pissed me off the point that I wanted to do better than her in life and I would never bother her again but a couple days later I got in a car accident and she let me back in the house since my car was unable to be driven anymore it's been a couple weeks I can tell she wants me to hurry up and leave but I lack the funds and need a car they cut my hours since I have a harder time getting to work now. We haven't talked about me wanting to commit suicide since that day.


If my car wasn't messed up I would of been sleeping in it."
depression,"I don't have any problems like everyone else, just a really bad personality I'm always hearing about ""trauma"" and ""addiction"", ""self harm"". People are always talking about events. When I call up lifeline they say, ""are you having a bad day? Tell me what happened?"" WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. NOTHING ""HAAPPPEENNNEEDD"" this is just how I am???? Literally the bare minimum amount of events have happened in my life. And I'm pretty sure my family is very supportive and better than everyone else's families. There is just something wrong with me and I'm pretty sure I was born like this, I've always been causing problems. So many people here I roll my eyes at cause I know that they have good personalities that will carry them through life and their problems, but they just ignore that. I wish I was one of you people that just had things happen to them instead of just being born bad. What am I supposed to do? Everybody says oh well nothing happened to you so it's all your fault. Okay??? All you people complaining don't know how good you have it. I am not like the rest of you. If I were to say and do everything I'm thinking and everything that is real and true I would be attacked or put in jail. How am I supposed to live like this? All I can do is be fake all the time or isolate myself"
depression,"How to be happy What is wrong with me? I just don’t feel happy. I just deserve happiness. I feel, I don’t  know, is it empty? I’m away to decompress but it doesn’t feel perfect like it should. I don’t know how to express myself. Ugh!"
depression,Just needed to type this out somewhere I wish I could just work like 12 hours a day everyday because it keeps all the bad thoughts out of my head. The second I get home and try to relax all the depressing thoughts hit me like a train. At least at work my mind is occupied with work shit but once I get home I get so depressed and that always makes me wanna drink and now I’m starting to develop alcoholic tendencies. I know I shouldn’t drink because of my problems and I try to keep myself from doing it but I can’t always stop myself. Drinking doesn’t even help either if anything it just makes me more sad but I always feel the need to be drunk when I’m depressed. I just want all these thoughts to disappear or to be able to disappear to the mountains and never have to see anyone or any of my problems again.
depression,"I don't get it. I'm too tired and too old to care. NSFW MENTIONS SUICIDE/MAY TRIGGER.

Im in my early 30s in a relationship with a caring gf and yet when I say I love you... nothing I feel nothing anymore, a one off comment by me was enough to make her walk away from me, I felt abandoned so I was walking home, alone, to take everything I could find to unalive, she caught up to me, I told her how I felt she didn't want to be with me, she tried to allay my concerns, it kind of worked but now when she snaps I think this is it. I told her I love her and when she says she loves me I don't get that fuzzy feeling anymore, even the slight one as we have been together 11 years. She didn't take it well, she didn't react to it but I can tell, I've hurt her, I told her my plan was to do it when I got home, now she is worried about me, about going out and leaving me on my own, I will be fine, I need to sleep for work anyway and I'm not going to let my manager down. And right now I have nobody to talk to because they are dealing with their own stuff and I wouldn't want to put on them so here I am rambling, trying to empty my brain so I can maybe sleep enough in 6 hours before work. I feel so fucking alone, so abandoned but I still have hope maybe my friends do care they just don't understand, so I will say I'm fine or even outright refuse to answer the question of are you okay? Because I might snap, I might bite their heads off so they run away and never look back. If you made it this far thanks for reading. Goodnight maybe later will be better, god I hope it's better."
depression,"I was doing well But mum took my confidence and obliterated it, told me I’m unattractive, fat, useless at everything i do and am not living up to her standards. Also when i make a mistake or mess up she will tell everyone about it and constantly bring it up any chance she gets.

Current issues: self-hatred, cynicism, using thoughts, suicidal ideation

Hi folks. Scared myself last night! Thoughts have been getting darker and darker since early September, and last night they kept me awake. Loud thoughts about suicide. Watched gore videos online, bad idea. Either way, my coursework is graphic and difficult anyway. 

Possible causes: anniversaries of some deaths, season change, mixed thoughts about sobriety, academic stress, change in lifestyle due to academic demands, including less time talking to friends

Need to make some changes. Any suggestions appreciated! Thank you"
depression,"i hate acne Ever since i started having acne everyday sucks, acne is the worst thing i ever have i don't want it. I care about my appearance i put so much effort everyday to look good but acne ruins it. Honestly i am a pretty person i get compliments about how pretty i was back then i still do get some right now but what they didn't know is that im actually covered with makeup, they didn't know how much effort i put just to cover myself but even if i put much effort im still self concious ""what if my face is cakey and they're noticing it"" ""omg this is what my skin looks all the time i was there"" ""shit the lighting here is so bright they'll see my acne"" im so jealous to those who has great skin, those people who doesn't need to put effort because they have clear skin i wish i was you."

Hating everything about me I’ve spent years feeling this way hoping for a better tomorrow and I’m still in the same position I was in college with the stress seeing others talking having fun socialising while I’m stuck in my head I’ve took a lot of thought of myself these past days and I think ending it is not so bad after all family are distant with me except for my mother but I just doesn’t feel enough I don’t even know what I want from life or what I’m even aiming for it’s like I’m just along for this miserable ride to I eventually die I just don’t know anymore I brought a noose and I look at it as away out of this feels like the times I enjoyed living when I was a kid has just dried up and I feel like a old man like my life is just ended  What does it mean to be happy?

depression,"i have no energy anymore im so tired bro. im very depressed right now and i cant even eat, get out of bed, brush my teeth, or anything. all i have the energy for is crying. i dont have anything that i enjoy and i have no one by my side to help me. i’ve lost almost everyone who i cared about. i’ve recently thought about suicide but i know i’d never have the balls to do it. i just need something to help me escape but ive tried everything."
depression,There is no point Only to enjoy yourself. Be selfish. Ya need friends to feel happy though. I got none. Girls dont like a guy with no friends. Girls dont like a guy whos never been in a long term relationship. The only people who love me are my family. Anyone else feel disconnected with everything. I feel like a piece of dust floating through my life. No new connections except the ones i was born with. And the fact that i dont have a social circle has resorted me to online dating which is the quickest way to resent women iv ever seen. Nobody cares; im going to die and the family i rejected in my younger life will try to recount memories that dont exist. Only wonder what could have been. She asks if i have any plans for holloween i told her im looking around she likes the response as if maybe asking for me to invite her. But she doesnt want to go out with “just me” that much im sure.
depression,the worst part about ADHD is the constant mental destruction. My brain is mentally drained and destroyed and makes me want to end it all. It scares the fuck out of me. I don't want to die but my brain has other ideas sometimes I want to do therapy but I get nervous

depression,"Wish there was someone here for me Just got of the phone with a friend who is at rock bottom or if not is extremely close to it and if I'm honest I just feel jealous he had me on the other end. That's the sort of person I am when things are tough for me I just help everyone but myself because it gives me some semblance of humanity. 
I really wish the universe would send a helping hand I sorely need because it fucking hurts that I'm the shoulder for suffering of everyone else and that I don't have that shoulder.
Even writing this now I feel so disgusted with myself that I'm writing a sob story because I can't help myself.
Just need a pat on the back is all I guess."

depression,"major depressive disorder Hey everyone, at 40 I'm realizing how I've been hobbled in life by major depressive disorder (MDD). Also a combat veteran. It's hard to understand which came first, the PTSD or MDD. Sometimes I think I can analyze everything and unravel my problems, but everything is enmeshed. There was depression before my deployment to Iraq resulting from emotional neglect and abandonment. 
Some days it's a struggle to get off the couch. I feel overwhelmed. Porn and alcohol have been my coping mechanisms up until now. Abstaining from both starting today. 
Stubborn when it comes to pharmaceuticals. I feel this can be addressed holistically with healthier decisions. Hoping reaching out to others for advice and just writing will help."

i am having my finals/annuals in 4 days and here i am dying and crying over the fact that i just got dumped for no reason? because the people who take breaks never comeback. i find my crying every other minute and i am unable to study. i am under another pressure too because i dont want to fail my finals or else i’ll end my life.

depression,"I dont know what I want Hello, I am a 22 year old girl, thanks for taking the time to read. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was 12, at 15 I developed trichotillomania and at 20 it increased too much. My family reproached me when they found out I had depression, they played the victims and I only pretended to be cured until I was 18 when I tried to kill them. I have been to 5 different psychologists, whenever I got to the psychiatric part my father feigned dementia and played the victim saying that what I have is for wasting time and ""doing nothing"". I self-harmed a lot in the past, the day my father found out he made it clear how ashamed he felt for me, however at least I went to therapy. But, nothing helped, nothing ever got better. And the only time I felt loved was by a boy I met online, we had a relationship for 3 years when I was 16 until I turned 19, then I found out that he catfished me and he was actually much younger than me, on top of that he was cheating on me with another girl, that tore me apart, I placed all my dreams and hopes in our future, something that never existed from the beginning. I keep going to therapy, I kept trying everything for myself and I have never achieved anything, I forced myself to have dreams because everyone had them, everyone knows where to go and what to do, I just know that no matter how many dreams I will never be enough for nothing and for no one. Sometimes I dream that someone loves me, sometimes I dream that I can be alone, sometimes I dream that my torture is over. And it is that for me living does not make any sense, there is nothing that compensates for existing, nothing is worth it for all the horrible things I feel. And the worst? I have no cure, nothing has a cure, now I've been diagnosed with AD, another disease with no cure and it's fucked up. Because I don't see a case for anything and living is a constant obligation, which I am obliged to follow when I didn't even ask for it. At least I would like to share with someone how I feel, but I know that nobody cares enough to want to read me. I would like someone to love me as I come to love, but I know that I no longer have the capacity to love as I did. I have lost too much in my life path, I have lost trust in others, I have lost the power to dream of even a decent future. No one is going to understand me, and no one is going to live it and I am going to continue swallowing my daily days where I feel that I am better, for later at night, my body and mind attack me until they want to make me vomit, choke on my cough, laughter and tears, of an indescribable pain but that I know."

depression,"21 feeling stuck, lonely, and depressed Life is getting harder to get through. I’m 21, and just graduated college with a full-time job that I’m not so sure I’m loving. Not only that, I have no friends. I keep rethinking my past and how I had so many cool people around me, and how I’m left all alone today. In some cases, I believe I was mistreated as a friend but I acknowledge times when I went wrong. Not having friends has made me super socially anxious. I can’t even have regular small talk or basic conversations . This leaves me feeling awkward over every single conversation - it’s exhausting! I feel like I’m too young to be so sad in stressed. I used to be bubbly, talkative, happy and had many people to hang out with. Now, I feel like I’m not even living the life of an ordinary girl in her early 20s. I haven’t traveled, never found love, and don’t even have one genuine connection or someone I have close emotional ties with. I hate when people ask about my day/weekend/life, because I’ve gone years with no interesting things happening. I used to say I’m meant to be alone to cope, but I feel like the biggest thing I’m missing is social connections. 

I’m going to be honest I constantly think about how long I can take living this life. Im not sure what I am even here for. I have so much hope and excitement for the future. I want to see if things will ever get better but I look at my old friends and see how much they’ve grown and feel discouraged. I also feel like I disappoint my parents because they want me to go out and be happy but all I do is stay at home sad. Does anyone have advice on how I can deal with my emotions and potentially fix up my life/mindset? I seriously feel lost and don’t know what to do."

depression,"My life has been tragedy after tragedy and I'm so tired. My life has been so difficult. 

Shortly after I was born my dad had a horrific workplace accident which left him permanently disabled. My whole childhood my mom had to work 2 jobs since my dad couldn't work and my dad spent all that time re-learning how to walk/eat/etc. My sister always has to be the one in charge of me and it unfortunately left both my sister and I with issues growing up since we both didn't have much of a childhood.

To top that off I was almost kidnapped in grade 8 and I was sexually assaulted for several years by a family member of mine.

When I started university one of my friends died of meningitis and another died of a brain aneurysm. Their absence hurt too much so I eventually stopped being friends with the rest of the group as it just felt wrong.

That same year I found out my mom was cheating and she manipulated my sister and I into not telling my dad. He eventually found out and kicked her out and ignored my sister and I for months for betraying him.  

After that my mom decided to move half way across the world to live with that guy and she didn't say goodbye or contact us to at least let us know she's alive for months.

In that time my dad spiraled into depression and turned to alcohol, my dog died, and we lost our house since my mom was our source of income.

I almost had to drop out of university because all of this was too much to handle.

I thought things got better when I met the person who I thought was the love of my life but I took a lot of my own pain out on him and the relationship turned toxic.  He ended up cheating on me and having a secret girlfriend for years before I found out. To make things even better, the day that I found out was also the day that my cousin, whom I was very close with, died of a preventable drug overdose (her friends were there and didn't call an ambulance until the next day because they wanted to sober up first before talking to police).

After this, which was probably the lowest point in my life, I worked on my issues with a therapist before dating again. But it didn't help because I keep dating men who emotionally abuse me and I don't leave them because deep down I feel like I deserve it.

If you're thinking 'well be thankful you have your health', yeah I'm also dealing with an autoimmune disease where I'm slowly losing my ability to see. So yeah there's that too!

I know everyone goes through things and I know I am totally victimizing myself right now.  I'm not saying all this to say my life is harder than anyone else's becuase I know I have it good compared to a lot of people.

Regardless of that though, I just feel so depressed and just done with life. I regularly go on long drives at night hoping that a drunk driver or something will take me away.

I just want it to end, I honestly can't say that I remember a time in my life when I was happy. I've always just been surviving and I'm so tired.

I won't do it because I don't want my family to lose yet another person, but man I dream about it every day."
depression,"I feel completely isolated I'm 15. I've been homeschooled my entire life.my family is extremely Christian, I'm not. The only chance to make friends is at church but that leaves me being fake to everyone around me. If I told anyone I'm not Christian it would mean social suicide. this has seriously affected my mental health"
depression,"4th day of Anti-depressants, therapy induction session is today. Trying my best to heal ❤️‍🩹 I really want to be okay again."
depression,"High functioning depression is over I have officially graduated to can’t do anything on my own depression.

I fail to do basic conversation now and stopped seeking therapy because the lady I was speaking to seemed inconvenienced. I couldn’t find the way to the library so I gave up on getting my textbooks for this quarter. Everything I get done is with help from my father, everyday. I’m a 20 year old who needs all the assistance of a 5 year old. Fuck this."
depression,"Falling deeper into depression every day but I'm too good at hiding it Things have progressively gotten worse and I'd like to think I didn't enable it. I've tried to be positive, I've tried finding new things, but it's like swimming against a massive current and the world's trying to push me back into my place. Where that place is, I'm not sure, but it's not where I want to be. Not where I can be, although I'm doubting that now. 

I can do better than this. I know I can, but why are things the way they are now. I'm scared of going back into therapy because I can't see the end goal (and I literally can't afford it, nor can I wait for the ones that are free/cheaper). Honest to god, I'm so lost. Faking it til you make it is not working anymore."
depression,"Can't even go to the bathroom Please, before you read this, i want to put a trigger warning about it. I have chronic depression, and this year in particular it's been extremely difficult for me, so this text it's going to be particulary raw. I want to share with you the worst face of depression in my personal case because I know some people think about the oddity of their habits due to this illness, but please, if you resonate with any of this, I want to tell you you're not alone. We all are in the same boat. Even when almost every day i contemplate suicide, it's mostly the pain i can cause to my family which keep me of not doing it. But i'm afraid  it's getting harder to mantain. And trust me, the paths depression leds are very impredictibles sometimes. 

I'm constantly on antibiotics because it's so hard to even drag myself to the bathroom that i had multiple urinal infections this year. This is super embarassing for me to tell, but the true of depression it's not like the movies, there is nothing romantic about it, specially when you just feel so lifeless that you finish sleeping in your own urine. It's disgusting. I'm disgusting. 

I can barely eat, sleep or talk without feeling exhausted. Eat it's the worst. Food it's tasteless, but i feel the textures too strong and makes me wanna throw up. Lifting the fork to my mouth it's draining. I had fell asleep with food in my mouth  still in the process of chewing. I barely drink water. It's just too hard to go to refill the glass. I just got used to the feeling of dryness in my mouth.

I think one of the worst sensations of depression it's this feeling of dehumanization, the apathy about yourself and your non active existence in this world.

Anyway. I'm tired of writting. Couldn't sleep. Didn't know what to do. I'm sorry if this was too boring or meaningless. 

Take care of yourself and i send you love. 

Goodbye"
depression,"I feel like doing it. You've chosen to read this, great. This is good because it will probably be one of if not THE last walls of text I am going to type. I want to kill myself

Life feels hopeless, it really is. Nothing matters. No one matters. Nobody cares. These are all feelings that I've caught so far. If you check my username you'll be able to tell that I'm clearly too young to be having these thoughts. I'm so young, almost at the height of most people's lives. But it is hopeless, it is like living in an endless prison, a planet sized prison. Every single object i look at feels fake since i probably know the reasoning and backstory to most of the world's issues. I and many of you could possibly die at any point in time and have little to no time to think through about what we've achieved in life. This is it, work 40-45 years until you're fucking dead. Few have been nice to me in life. This is unfair, since I've always been there to help, EVEN at my lowest. Fuck. You. Fuck this game that I'm losing, this battle, this war. This feels like a war. A war with my own mind, my mind constantly overthinks EVERYTHING. It is too much for one person to handle every single day. All of these people that seem programmed my mathematicians and scientists to be as fucking evil as possible. I know your motives, wether it'd be power, money or control. 

I've read so much, seen so much that I've become burned out as a human being. When you threaten youself with suicide, only then will people tell you that they care ad love you. What? When? More importantly, where was this compassion you had for such a ""smart and interesting"" man you've possibly felt BEFORE I was about to do it?! Why is this world so fast and competetive? No one slows down, they just want to live life as if it were a game, we're all just depressed people telling others to ""chin up"" when they feel down. Weeeell, maybe not for most of you...But, most certainly for me. My own parents have beat me for 11 years, because I was never ""good enough"" even though they sometimes tell me I'm smart and hard-working or something like that. 

I feel like I'm 100 years old and that time only seems to shatter my mind. Is this an overreaction? Or a genuine call for help. We. Want. More. We expect more from life. All of you, I'm sure of it. Life isn't perfect, but it really doesn't have to be like this. I promise all of you, it can be better. But right now, none of us peasants have a say in this world. Just as if I was playing a video game, I really feel like ending it right now. This is how I feel. This is who I am. I am sorry, but I really will be killing myself by jumping in front of a train. I want people to see yet ANOTHER desperate human leading itself to its own demise. Because I am a failure, at best I will probably just become cannon fodder for yet another war."
depression,"When I’m gone Been wishing that I could be in a coma,
Just finally get a break from being in a conscious, and maybe see if anyone would care if I’m gone, then I spent time thinking about what my funeral would be like, and how not many would care, im a nobody not worth much to anyone,"
depression,"Destined to be alone. Killing myself tonight I’m done with it. No point in living anymore I’m going to kill myself tonight, I can’t seem to look at myself and feel useful. I feel like this world has nothing for me. It’s like nothing is waiting for me in the future. I don’t want to survive this time I really don’t I rather best be dead and observe everyone live there life and be happy. I hate myself and never want to be alive again. Idk who will find this but thanks for being in my life. 
Goodbye.

I’m 19 I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship.

I’ve tried everything in person dating apps I get the numbers and then they just ghost me. I look around and see couples holding hands cuddling and so on and I just come back to my place alone and I’m  thinking of ending it soon not because of this."
depression,"Ex moved on and started going on dates 2 weeks after they dumped me and i’m struggling to function. It hurts so bad how quickly they moved on, were we not in the same relationship? How am I hurting so bad and they are fine and ready to move on. My heart hurts so bad, we were together so long. I feel do betrayed 💔 I started taking Anti depressants on Monday and my therapy induction session is today, ready to try and heal."
depression,"doubting about therapist. I tried posting this over and over again, but it just doesn't het posted so i do a short version now. 

I asked for therapy beginning of 2022. I have chronic depression and i'm back in an episode that already started 2,5years ago. I found someone who had a waiting lists of 4 months instead of at least 6. I talked with a guy at the gp's office to deal with the time. 

The therapist called me in the beginning to see if we would fit. She called me in july tellingen that she is starting a group therapy with a colleague and if i was interested. I can see the benefits of it, but i'm sure it is not for me. She would keep on going about the group and i kept on going that i'm very unsure about it. We agreed on doing an intake and i could still see if i want to participate in the group or just want individual session. 

The intake was last friday with her and the collegae. I could do my story and they kept telling me how good the group would benefit me, but i felt kind off pushed into this option which i really don't like and it doesn't feel good. I also have to be committed until June next year and i don't know if i can do it because my relationship is so rocky that it is better for me to move soon. Getting away from this relationship is an urgent thing that is dragging me down for the last 2,5 years now. So i don't know at the moment how my life will go. 

So i told her about that as well and that i felt more comfortable to do individual session. She told me then that she had a spot earliest in January. I politely got angry because that means i have to wait another 4 months after already more then half a year. She apologised because she took me of the list for individual session because she thought i would agree to the group. But that is definitely not what we agreed on. She called me later to apologize again and told me she hadn't been clear to me. 

She will call me tomorrow to ask what i want. I felt pushed into the idea of the group and i don't like it already from the start. I told them my reasons and i stick to them. But now i have to wait months again. The idea of finally having therapy is what kept me going. I'm functioning properly but don't know for how long i can do this anymore by myself. 

I also don't know if i even feel comfortable with her anymore. If this is the start, what will happen in the rest of the proces? But that would mean i will have to put myself on another waiting list, or multiple this time, and wait 6 months. I could go back to the guy i talked with before but it only postpones things happening, it doesn't get worse as fast when taking to him. 

I had therapy before a couple of years ago, i thought i was doing the right thing but it wrecked me. I'm angry at her and i'm never angry. The therapy before didn't have the waiting lists that long (also different times) and were just chill, but it is to far to go back to. 

It partly venting i guess.. but i also feel a bit lost atm, so tips are welcome."
depression,"Got a diagnosis for recurrent depressive disorder Well i don’t know if it’s right because honestly I don’t remember if I’ve had more than 1 depressive episode however. It feels nice to have validation by a psychologist on one hand, and on the other hand, now I’m scared I will have another depressive episode in the future. My last (?) depressive episode lasted between 1 to 3 years (idk when it *actually started) and I’ve been recovering since the start of 2022. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. I never want to feel like that again, so the fact that it’s recurrent is kind of killing me. It’s the most worthless I’ve ever felt in my life, I had no control, no energy to shower or brush my teeth or do groceries or eat, let alone do the things I used to love like my studies or see my family or working out or being creative. I’m finally getting all that back and the thought I can end up losing it again in a new episode… knowing I’ll feel it happening and won’t be able to do anything against it. God. 

Okay so those are my darker feelings on this diagnosis. But on the bright side, when I was in my episode, I felt like I had just lost myself entirely, and my passion for things in life would never come back to me—but now I know that it can, because that has happened for me luckily. So I’ll just hold on to that if it happens again. &amp; yes I’m starting therapy soon :)"
depression,"I just need someone to listen to me.. I am a college student studying in one of the most expensive but also premier colleges in my country...my parents have worked tirelessly to get me here...we come from a poor family, my college fees is twice the annual income in our family...and my grades are bad...I partly blame the online semester because i never liked to cheat and the class quality was subpar...I have a 6.22/10 cgpa...and I've tried to improve it. I spent nights up late studying. I've really given it my best in the last two months to get better....but it wasn't enough the exam was just really tough everyone did bad but everyone scored good grades in online.. and even if i did good i'm in my 5th semester its just really hard to increase CGPA now...I just feel like i shouldve just cheated when i had the chance..I feel like my parents are throwing their money on me on a useless pile of shit...I feel like this money would've been more useful for my sister...I feel like killing myself just so that my parents dont waste any more money on me...I know many people won't read this....I've read a few other posts and honestly my entire reason for depression seems stupid compared to what some people go through idek if i have depression...but if anyone does can you please just give me hope...thats all i need...thank you if you read this far"
depression,"I dont deserve to be sad It's strange. Idky it's so easy for me to feel sad and lonely. My life isnt that bad. I'm not struggling terribly. Not many bad things have even happened. Yet I insist on making my life miserable by ignoring the things I have/want to do. There is no reason for me to not get back on my feet. So just fucking do it. Get up and do it. Dont think. Just move. But there's this part that says screw it. Idc at all. It would be easier to just die. I think I may just like being a victim. But why. It's not like i get attention for it like when i was a kid. Nobody is even around. Theres no one to even feel bad for me. So what. What do I get. Maybe it's just a way for me to justify not trying and giving up. Like hey I'm so sad and life is hard so sorry cant do that. Such bullshit. Yet in my hatred of that part of myself I make things worse. There's this reaction of me trying to beat that part up and make it do things it doesnt want to do. But in trying to force it I make that part of me feel worse, especially when I fail once I finally get it to do something. I'm just dumb. Idky what I feel about all this. Idk what's going on. I should tell my therapist but I just lie to her about things. I lie to everyone about how I'm doing. I just tell them what I think they would like to hear or expect of me. I dont want them to know what's really going on, even tho I know it would be best if they did. Cuz then they could help me. Instead here I am, on some reddit page speaking to nobody but myself. I want hurt myself for being so dumb."
depression,just a sad lil vent i wish i could press a button to make all this pain and sadness go away
depression,"Cant keep fighting off these thoughts My parents decided to move to Europe from the US, which I was completely on board with, however, this required me to take another year of highschool. I don’t know how many are familiar with the IB system but this is the hardest course I’ve taken so far, especially coming from a public US school. Every day I feel like a failure, I miss my friends, I miss being a top student, I feel stupid, looked down upon, and I think about suicide every day. I see all my friends graduating and having fun, while I’m stuck here. I have a good group of friends but I still feel like an outsider. I don’t have a “home”. I don’t want to kill myself but I want to escape this crippling stress, anxiety, and self loathing, and the first place my mind always goes is “commit suicide”. I bite my nails until they bleed. And no one in fucking europe plays baseball, which I excelled in, so I had to humiliate myself by trying to learn basketball, while getting mocked and laughed at the entire time. I don’t know what I’m going to do and I worry about my future every day"
depression,"I'm just really done with life Note- posting this on throw away account

I feel like I’m never going to get better and at this point have been debating suicide  , and that most people would be better off without me. I've been dealing with feeling like this on and off since 8th grade.

I feel like all of my friends would just get over it in a month or two if I were to do it.   My best friend, the one who would care, has her own mental problems and I had to talk her down multiple times from attempting it.  One day I will probably end up losing her, and that thought alone makes me just wanna go.   My boyfriend is one of the main reasons I haven’t.  He would be crushed but I feel so guilty even thinking about  suicide because of him.    I never want to tell him when i'm struggling, or anyone because I think I don’t matter and have a hard time opening up to him .  I feel like I’m gonna ruin the relationship because of it, but I can’t help it.  I hate telling people my problems.

I barely tell anyone about my past either, of having to hide from my dad while he is screaming and yelling at my mother as a kid so he wouldn't do the same to me as he as before,  or how I got bullied my whole elementary school for all the years, and how people still bullied me through middle and high school.    How during the first two years of high school I was being groomed by multiple men online, one even getting me to send him CP. The other main one was from my school who was a senior who I met a month before he graduated.  After always showering me in love, probably just to try to get me to do sexual things with him, he decide yeah im gonna get a girlfriend and cheat on her because of talking to you still. He talked to me for almost a year.   He made me feel like I was everything then nothing at all.   Thank god my mom never let me go see him in person, so no it was physical.     Part of me still feels like I was never abused in any way by my dad or by older men.  I feel like it’s not enough to be counted as trauma even though I will be thinking about it every week, and get pretty upset each time. I realized I can’t really remember the first two years of hs. I hate myself because of the things others have said about me while bullying me.  I don’t believe i'm good in anyway, personality wise or looks.

I don’t have fun anymore doing anything, I end up stopping whatever I'm playing or doing in a short time because I don’t have the motivation to do it.   I basically just play a game or watch something while roleplaying with my best friend when I’m not at work just to past the time.    It feels like I’m getting zero joy anymore,  I get pissed off at everyone for the smallest things at this point.   On the topic of anxiety,  I get  anxious all the time over things I can’t control and it just keeps getting worse because the world is just straight up going to hell as it seems which does end up leading to attacks sometimes.    My emotions feel out of control,  half of the time I'm either numb or feeling everything at once, when I'm mad or that one time when I am happy.     I tend to snap at people a lot because of this, including my boyfriend, and I feel horrible about it, it makes me hate myself even more than I already do.   I feel horrible when I’m unmotivated because my room becomes trashed to the point where you cant see the floor and old food on my desk or shelf is growing mold.   I don’t help around the house(still living with parents).  I don’t wanna do anything I don’t wanna clean or work or even eat and shower.   I don’t even cry that much anymore

When it comes to eating, nothing ever sounds good anymore and I can’t tell if it’s due to my depression or another problem, like my fear of gaining weight.   Like I legit don’t wanna eat because of it and feel guilty when I don’t but I don’t wanna say I have an eating disorder because it doesn’t feel severe  enough and I don’t lose weight yk.

After always feeling this way,  one of the things that pisses me off the most is the fact that the biggest reason I won’t go through with my thoughts isn't because of my will or anyone in my life.  It’s the fact that I'm terrified to die, to the point of it causing anxiety attacks and I feel like that is also one of the main causes of why I'm depressed is knowing the fact I will die and there is a chance of there just being nothing.  It makes life meaningless pain to me.   I know my struggles just fade away, sometimes pretty fast like days of depression vs me actually being happy which makes me feel like its just in my head, I'm not depressed.  I don’t think I even have a right to say it because I'm not diagnosed with anything.   I feel so guilty for feeling about now I do, and I feel even more guilty about making this post so long, I needed to get this out."
depression,"Do I need to see a psychiatrist or do I just need to be told that life isn’t fair? I haven’t had any life experiences which probably makes me more selfish and sensitive than the average person. 

I can’t really deal with the everyday problems of life. I’m so anxious and on edge, its uncontrollable. I’ve tried to ignore my irritation but all that happens is my moods are more intense and I become more volatile to the people around me. I know I say that my emotions are unstable and I can’t control how I feel, but what if it’s all a lie? What if subconsciously I know what I’m doing and doing it anyway to make me unhappier? That sounds stupid,"

I can't picture me prospering or happy. those things feel foreign to me. like I'm undeserving and destined to suffer forever because I cannot separate myself from my cruel mind. to peel back the skeleton that remains of a former Margaret. she is going, going, gone and in her place an imposter. a carcass of that which once was.

depression,I wish everyone forgot about me so I can kill myself without hurting anyone The only reason I haven't died yet is because of my family. I can't bear to cause them any pain. I just wish my entire existence got erased so that I can die without them crying over me.
depression,yes. i try so hard in school. yet i fuck up every exam. Theres noone to be mad at except for me. Its so hard handeling these feelings.

I've tried talking about it with my dad before but he's the ""that's how people your age are, just suck it up"" type. I''ve tried therapy and antidepressants even just generally keeping myself busy so I won't have to be alone with my thoughts. It didn't help. The only thing that was ""helping"" me was getting hurt intentionally but there's only so many times you can do that before people close to you start noticing you're not clumsy.

depression,"I Can't Wait For October... I'm completely convinced that 2022 is the worst year I experienced. There's pretty much new problems for me every week and my months contain at least one traumatizing memory. My aunt was diagnosed with cancer on my birthday, I was indirectly rejected the night before Valentine's Day, my best friend betrayed me and took advantage of me for grades, and so many more. But the worst of all is my dad, who never even cared, but pretends to do so for personal gain. My dad who only rubs salt on the wounds and sometimes he causes them too. He always had a hidden agenda, and I knew it from the moment my mom exposed his past a few years ago.

Ever since January, I had been taking care of my cousin. We learned that our entire family had Covid, and someone had to take care of her. My mother volunteered to take her in, since we were the first to recover. Since the holidays had recently passed, the Covid cases were at an all time high, so classes were cancelled to give students and teachers time to recover. During these times, taking care of my cousin was just a walk in the park. By the end of the month, online classes were resumed, which made it harder for me. I had to balance my academics and taking care of my cousin, which was difficult because both of our classes start nearly at the same time.

It was March when I heard news of my father's return. At first I felt annoyed, because my least-favorite person (which is an understatement) is going to live in our house for the next 3+ months. But this slowly turned into delight. After getting in trouble at school for passing my work late, my mom got so mad. During this time, I realized that once my father gets home, he'll take care of my cousin, which means that I can focus more on my own grades. But I was disappointed. Not only did he not take care of my cousin, he also spoiled her, making it harder for me to take care of her. He also made unnecessary demands (for his own benefit) that just made things harder for me.

By the end of May, my aunt's situation was better. My cousin also finished her school. She finally returned to her home. Seeing her go made me feel as if a weight in my heart has finally been lifted. But the torture didn't end there...

I was lucky to have my dad gone for most of the first few weeks of June. I was able to fully prepare for my exams and finish any unfinished tasks. After the exams was deadline week. My teachers were lazy in their projects so they usually announce the project two weeks before deadline week or on the week itself. My friends and I worked on the project overnight. It was my area of expertise so the group really relied on me and my girl best friend to do the hardest parts on the work. It was a few hours before the initial deadline (we thought we had to pass it before the initial deadline because we thought we have to present it in class) when my dad forced me to go to bed. I knew that my friend can finish our work in the remaining time, but she won't be able to prepare for the presentation. I spoke against my dad and he raised his voice, his pride was tarnished, he was ready to hit me when my mom screamed. My mom forced him to stop, which basically saved the project. 

A few days after that, I asked my mom to let me visit my uncles for the next few days. My uncle's wife's niece's (I don't know that right term) birthday is coming up soon and I am really close with her. My dad was sitting beside my mom that day, my mom agreed but my dad butted in and declined. That day, I saw his hatred for my mom's siblings first hand. I always heard stories of how he would talk shit behind their backs. He came up with some random bullshit and just used it as an excuse. I was so pissed that day.

Most of July and the first weeks of August were just his usual everyday bullshit, it's not really worth mentioning, or else this post will just become a novel at this point.

My mentor and coach told me about a training a few cities away and he always wanted me to go. I never came because my mom didn't want me to go alone, and my dad just doesn't feel like taking me there all the time (he also doesn't know how to drive). After attending a local training, I organized with a friend to take me there. I was happy for most of those weeks since I get to reconnect with old friends and I also had the chance to work on myself more. As I get more and more involved, I was told of an upcoming national tournament. I was enlisted to compete. I, despite the almost unlimited free time, had barely any time to train on my own because my dad would just make it harder than it needs to be. I ended up losing due to lack of training. On that day, I also learned that my theories are real. My mom got so pissed that she decided to buy my dad out of our lives, which was actually just a test. My dad took the bait and grabbed the money (which was only 20 bucks). He had to come up with some obvious lie. My mom made him stay for the sake of my ""innocence"". 

When school started again, my dad would listen in on the online classes and talk shit about my teachers. It literally got me so annoyed. He would also bombard me with questions which just annoys me even more. He kept asking about the things I need as a way of pretending to care (he had been pretending so hard since I lost the tournament), as if he actually cared! I'm delighted to hear that he'll be leaving for work soon. But he's getting on my nerves more frequently than ever.

I never really had the chance to open up to my friends, I haven't talked to them properly ever since June, which was when my dad was away for training. I'm looking forward to October, but I'm not really sure about that. I feel like 2022 is my cursed year, there's a lot more traumatizing things that happened this year that I just didn't say because my dad was the focus of this post."
depression,"I think I might have depression because I lost interest in playing games I was a small youtuber playing games. I love to play video games. I can play 24/7. Then with in a few days I suddenly don’t want to play anymore. I feel nothing for a long time. I am also effected by what happened in my family. Which makes it worst.

Recently I feel a bit better. My head hurts a bit so I am on bed early. I am trying to get back to my health mental stage. I am going to have meeting with my professors and counselor. I have been to the counselor a lot since senior high. I am very happy that people here are welling to help me. Instead of doesn’t care about us at all, like my high school. I feel better the more compliments I got. I also feel better the more caring I got. I feel reborn from the pieces of a broken ceramic doll. I grow up in a pretty unfriendly environment. I know people around me also have mental issues, but no one cares about us."

depression,"How I have overcome depression Hi. I know that many of you here may be going through hard challenges in life whether that be from financial circumstances, or from being in a toxic relationship. I too have experienced some troubles with families that basically caused me to start being depressed right around the age of 13. I was in a household where 5/6 of the kids that lived there were by my stepmom and I looked completely different from all of my siblings. My stepmom would basically make me the scapegoat for all of the problems that went on in the house. When I talked to my girlfriend about it over text message , she recommended that I tell my stepmom how I feel. I told my girlfriend that I’d rather not because my stepmom is just so sensitive. My stepmom read my texts later and went off on me saying “YOU THINK IM SENSITIVE, IM NOT SENSITIVE.” I would try my hardest to make my parents proud until I realized that everything only going to get worse. I was grounded from the time I was 12 until I was almost 17. I couldn’t own a phone until I moved out when I was 16. 

Enough with the sob stories though. What am I up to now? How did I overcome it?

Since I was a kid I always showed an interest in music, videos, photography, making clothing, traveling, and working on cars. I always believed I could do these things but I was always discouraged from everyone in my family except for my dad. One day I got sick of being in a toxic environment and told myself that if I really wanted to kill myself, then I would of done it already. I didn’t want to kill myself, I wanted to kill what was inside of me. I made the decision to move out and I was broke and didn’t even have a bed. My friend was nice enough to let me live in his apartment for a couple of months until I got on my feet. I applied to junior college to go to school to learn auto body and am now making money to do projects for people. I learned how to do stock option trading and made 1.2k from my college dorm yesterday and am getting better everyday. I have a clothing brand, make music videos for artists, have a couple small businesses, and can basically do whatever I want now. I would definitely say that money has a lot to do with being happy but at the same time I have a friend that is making lots of money and can’t seem to be genuinely happy. One of the main keys to being happy is is to put yourself in an environment where you can be yourself. I always told myself when I was young that I wanted to be rich and that I wanted to be happy. We all want things but life isn’t easy, it’s very hard. There were days I couldn’t eat, my girlfriend left me and cheated on me, my grandma and great grandma died, I lost friends that I thought would be there forever, but I’m here. Discipline yourself, the story turns around eventually and god is very real. The girl that cheated on me is with an ugly fat guy with dreads and now I’m with a dime piece from New Zealand. She’s broke, I’m up. Everyday I get to do whatever I want while she has to live in regret with what she did. Remember the stepmom that  was being mean to me? She has cancer now and is also broke. The mean people in my friend group all got fat and ugly are now also broke while I’m making arrangements to go to Puerto Rico with my beautiful 6’0  queen from New Zealand. There is a happy ending you just have to want it bad enough."
depression,"i am just bad at everything I have somehow wormed myself into a design gig at a construction firm with mediocre but stable income. Since I didn't graduate, i am actually a nobody. I am expected to do more than just design. Accounts, purchase, liabilities and much more apart from preparing drawings. Jack of all trades, master of none but also bad at all those trades, defines my situation the best. I feel like a sore loser and my time here has an expiry date. I would like to be prepared for the kicking out. I barely have the strength to go on everyday. I have 15 day cycles of good and bad days and the switch is the worst. I really need a push in the right direction."
depression,"Feel like everything is passing me by... I'm a 31yo dude living in Rural Australia. I have a wife, a 10 month old son, a job and a home. I shouldn't really have much to complain about, yet lately I am finding no joy in anything whatsoever. 

I gave up my dreams of being a sound designer for films/games 10 years ago. A lot of it had to do with my girlfriend (now wife) making it nearly impossible for me to pursue my true interests and perfect my craft. I always had to support her while we both studied. I eventually dropped out of the degree I was studying for and moved back to my rural hometown for her. I still feel resentment towards her for that. 

It's not as if I didn't try to make the most of things either, I tried for years after that to get an apprenticeship doing a trade. But no luck there as I didn't have a clue about any of that stuff and wasn't passionate about it. I just ended up working shitty manual labour jobs and fast forward 10 years that's what I'm still doing. 

Apart from my son,  I fucking hate my life. I feel so lost and lack the confidence I used to have in my early 20s to pursue anything. I can't even enjoy music or movies anymore. I used to sit there for hours playing music, writing, recording, editing and just being creative. Now, I pick up the guitar for 30 secs and just think what's the fucking point? I can't do anything with this now. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I've slowly fucked up my life. I feel trapped in this town, there's no opportunity here unless it's mind numbing manual labour, my friends are all sexist nim-witted drunks, my wife controls every aspect of my life and to top it all off I work 50-60 hours every week and I still have to do desperate shit like sell my personal belongings to pay our bills. 

Seriously see no way out of this shitty situation apart from suicide."
depression,"the people I cared about the most lie to me A year ago I tried to kill myself, I thought after therapy everything was going better but
Here we are and I'm thinking of ending things
Everyone lies to me
I'm just an afterthought and I'm so done"
depression,"It doesn't get better, it actually gets much worse! I have no job and my savings have been drained. I literally have not a dollar I've earned remaining and over $1100 in bills that'll have to be paid in this coming month. Every avenue I've pursued in the span of three months has been dead ends, either not making it past an interview or being almost immediately denied. It's been almost three years since I've had a friend my age so my only social outlet has been two family members that're too old to truly relate to.

There's not a day that goes by where I don't think of committing suicide in some way. Most common being cutting my arm open or retrieving the pistol from my fathers house and blowing my frontal lobe out. I've suffered from severe depression for years now and I honestly do not know or remember what it is like to be happy. There are times I've almost been content, but those times don't last long at all. 

I don't know what to do anymore. A rule of life I've learned in my 20yrs of living is that in order for someone to win/succeed, someone in return has to lose/wither. Try as one may, neither is a guarantee until you're there; and I'm there. I've lost and at this point I'm delaying the end, but it'll come."
depression,"I have no safe place to cry alone. I've been having crying sessions since my breakup, but yesterday I couldn't and now I'm at work about to cry my eyes out. I can't cry at home because everyone would hear me and ask me too much. The past few days I had been driving to a parking lot that was pretty empty to cry in. However, a student saw me there the other day and recognized me. Now her and her friend know I've been crying. Her friend asked why, but I was able to brush the question aside luckily and they didn't push it anymore. 
I don't want to be at work. I'm nauseous, cramping, dehydrated, and emotional. I have to be though.  Where else would I go? Home where my family is? Somewhere public where I might break down? 
I'm trying to calm down at work before making copies. I think my period is making me emotional to everything and the breakup just adds on to it.
I am tearing up. Trying to completely have not  breakdown. I think I'll be ok, but I just don't feel the best."
depression,"At 24 I am a failure for being traumatized and unable to take care of myself My other 20 year old friends live on their own, have jobs, and are independent

While I'm sitting her contemplating between suicide euthanasia and treatment center for severe abuse I experienced over my life

I hate not being high functioning enough to get a job and do stuff. I feel ashamed that I need help because I am so battered

My worth depends on being a functional member of society and because I can't I feel too ashamed to be around people

I'm a failure"
depression,"I just don’t care anymore and it never gets easier I’ve been off my meds for about a month again and I’m ignoring my psychiatrist again. My doctors insists that I need to be on anti-depressants but constant medication changes make me highly sucidal and unpredictable. These medicine combinations are purely random and they aren’t fixing anything. They keep telling telling to “give it another chance” and my mental health keeps declining farther and farther. 

My ex-therapist said we where going to try cognitive behavioral therapy and it wasn’t working the slightest. The sessions left me talking in circles and losing focus on the subject. She just kept upsetting me until I started crying in frustration and I would pretend to be fine so I was allowed to leave. She just kept remaining how little control I had over my parent’s behavior towards me, my medicine and everything seemed like my fault. 

I was receiving video therapy sessions because I insisted that my social anxiety was getting to me. The real reason is how sucidal these physical sessions made me feel. I would space out on the road, thinking how easy it would be to smash into the trees and spend the rest of the day feeling numb and tired. I honestly didn’t feel safe traveling home and didn’t want to tell my doctors. 

My old therapist called the cops on me and my mom was forced to take me to the doctor to confirm I was “safe”. I wanted to take the 72 hours watch but my mom was in the room and I couldn’t say yes in front of her. To this day, still regret letting her control me like this. She basically swept everything under the rug and blamed my instagram use and told me I’m never going to be like those models, it’s all fake anyway. She made me watch doctor Phill and that was basically the end of it. We never brought it up again. She probably doesn’t even remember when I got drunk on vodka and pills, smiling like a fucking idiot. Mom is just lecturing me while I’m on cloud fucking nine and really sleepy, again swepted under the rug.

Medicine or no medicine, I feel so unstable and everyone acts like I’m being stubborn and not trying hard enough to be happy. Within four years, I’ve covered myself in cuts and basically had two overdose scares. Nobody reacts anymore and I don’t know if I care anymore either. When my dog finally passes away, I will most likely join him. Nothing else is holding me back at this point. I don’t know what is wrong with my head but I’m probably not gonna find out before I end up killing myself.


Basically most recent events in a nutshell:

I have random bursts of uncontrolled crying or anger

Bursting into tears at the end of my job shifts, I don’t want to go home

Unable to sleep properly and always tossing/turning

Waering headphones on head more often, head pressure keeps me calm

Unreasbly angry at everything, always ready to scream or hurt someone

Tried to swallow medication in a severe panic-attack episode (again)

Paranoia still not letting up after months, afraid someone is breaking in, loved-ones aren’t “themselves” and weird things popping up in head 

Body shaking episodes/heart-racing and can’t calm down no matter what

How do your explain four years of mental decline to a new therapist, I don’t know

Passively Suicidal"
depression,I’m so alone I have 2 friends. My relationship of 3 years is over. I want someone to talk to. My best friend Erik barely answers texts and is busy all day. My other friend Vincent won’t stop talking about his ex. I feel like I can’t talk to either of them. I hate being such a loner man
depression,"Massive mood swings? Hi all. I think I've been on the cusp of depression for a while, but sometimes it comes to a real head and it's starting to worry me how quickly my mood shifts. 

For the past two days I've been absolutely miserable - not wanting to get out of bed, having these weird spikes of 'would it be easier if I were dead?', crying at work, and just generally being a mess. I woke up this morning not wanting to go to the office, wanting to call in sick. 

But a few hours later and I don't have these feelings anymore. I'm not 100% happy but I'm pretty content. The things I was worrying and getting sad about yesterday are making more sense to me now. 

This happens ALL the time. It's like a light flips. But when it's dark, it's really dark. I'm just a bit exhausted by it."
depression,"Scared to take lexapro I heard loads of bad reviews saying it causes weight gain and loss of libido.

Is this true?"
depression,"someone please talk to me I'm 18M, and have been feeling very depressed for multiple years now. I have never shown it or told anyone. I have had a close group of friends for over 5 years and when I'm with them in person it's the best feeling in the world.
As soon as I'm not, I'm taken as the joke. The 'bro code' applies to everyone but myself. It's like I have no feelings and they can say and do whatever they want to me because they know I won't bite back.
For example, I had a gf for a few months, the whole time my friends told me to leave her, how she was horrible and how they hated her. Come the time we split, my friends all went to her side, my best friend is now even getting with her.
I moved away to uni a couple weeks ago, and for the first time I was happy. I met a girl who was and is still soo special to me. She made me the happiest guy in the world. She has some personal issues and she told me to not tell anyone. Stupidly I told my friend, which was wrong in the first place, and she found out.
After this he proceeded to tell her about my ex, who had no revelance to any of it.
Now I've lost the one person I truely loved and cared for. I have nothing to be happy about. I'm currently trying to work things out with her but it's not looking good.
I've gone back into that state of depression, trying to find ways to end my life as peacefully as possible.
I just need someone to talk to, please
Thank you reddit."
depression,I feel like shit I'm honestly probably a disapointment to my parents and my self my grades are lowering down drastically my friends don't like me anymore I was good at the start but now I feel like a sack of things you don't need
depression,How do I know if I'm really depressed and not just using it as excuse for my shortcommings? Is there online help I could anonymously reach out to? I just don't want to be who I am anymore. I want to change and don't know how.
depression,"It's been a year and I still think about her everyday Basically, I fudged up and lost a girl I was dating for almost three years. We were madly in love but I had major trust issues from previous relationships and was way too jealous all the time. On top of some anger issues, I couldn't control I just was somewhat of a shitty boyfriend.. Never did anything bad to her just was mean about situations and only saw things my way. Of course, all I do now is reflect on what an idiot I was.. There is no chance of her taking me back. 

Life is just a depressing cycle of waking up and doing the same things every day, without the one thing I want the most, her. I don't care about my job, I don't care about my second degree that I'm almost finished with. I don't even care about my health anymore. I still take care of all of those things, but I have no reason or purpose behind my intentions anymore. I'm just doing stuff, to do stuff. I spend time with family and friends, but I'm not mentally there. I've gone to therapy a couple of different times, I've tried working out and taking my health seriously, but just get de-motivated to continue those efforts because I simply don't care about anything anymore. 

Idk, I just need help figuring out how to get out of this cycle and be that happy guy I once was. Has someone been here before? What helped?"
depression,"Bad days turn into weeks, months, years Sometimes you have a bad day. Well there's always tomorrow. Then it becomes a string if bad days. Well it's just a bad week, it'll get better next week. Then it becomes a string of bad weeks, now it's a bad month. Well next month has to be better. Then all of a sudden it's many months, most of the year. Well next year will be better. New year, new me. But it never gets better."
depression,"Anxiety Climate breakdown, UK economy tanking, inflation rising, Russian annexing Ukrainian territories and threatening nuclear retaliation, and right &amp; far-right parties gaining momentum in several European elections.

I'm actually so fucking terrified right now it's unreal, please tell me I'm not alone here."
depression,Been depressed for a while I think I’m going to get fired on Monday and I can’t sleep. My dad is a partner in the firm but not the sole owner so if I do get fired I don’t know how I’m going to come back from this.
depression,"The Only Thing Keeping me going is the thought of my daughter without me At the beginning of 2021 I went into a spiral whirlwind which left me mentally paralyzed with anxiety and depression. 

I worked my ass off for almost 2 years with therapy and medicine to get better and things were improving greatly.

All of a sudden this past week I saw 1 thing. 1 thing that triggered a complete relapse. I feel back to where I started. I don’t have the energy to do this again. I’m so distraught. I’m going through the motions of life again. Living In paralyzing fear and anxiety . Always worried, always worried about things I can’t control. I can’t let it go.

Suicide has been on my mind again. I just can’t imagine anymore of this .

The only thing keeping me going right now is my 5 month old daughter. I want so much for her. I want to see her grow .

But I just can’t fathom living in my brain anymore."
depression,"My experience with depression. At the ripe age of 13 I experienced my first wave of depression. From the ages of 13-15 depression seemed to come in large waves and seemed to have some driving reason behind it. Many times I had mild suicidal thoughts but I always had a reason not to do it. At the end of year 9, during covid lock down I developed terrible depression that has lingered for a year. It came from a profound sence of loneliness seeing that I had never had a girlfriend and had been rejected a few times. At the start of year 10 I got a girlfriend who was gender fluid and wasn't really a girlfriend. The depression eased during this period of a month, but never went away. After the painful experience of that girl I realized that a girlfriend was not the thing that was going to fix my problems and I felt worse then ever. I felt truly alone. For the past 8 months I have been majorly depressed and have had suicidal thoughts. Several relisations have come apon me over these past months. One of which is that I am truly alone. I have noone to talk to about my problems which only makes them worse. 
Then out of nowhere something I thought was impossible became possible, a girl like me. At first I didn't believe it but soon developed feelings as well. Then as quickly as it had happened she lost feelings for me after I expressed an opinion she did not agree with. It tore my heart out. Now all I have in my woodworking. And my job. And my dogs. I feel trapped in my thoughts of my past actions. I always had a goal in life but now I have no goal and I feel empty.
I want to seek help but I don't know where to go so I thought I'd try here and see if it would help. I know just writing it down makes me feel a bit better anyway."
depression,"Life gets worse each day I went through an entire day last week without any suicidal thoughts and while I was in school today, I daydreamed about me being dead after hanging myself in our bathroom. I’m so tired and everytime I tell myself to just get through one day at a time, the next day manages to be worse than the last and it’s starting to get unbearable."
depression,"things that used to make me happy aren't the same anymore been trying to escape the thought of me being not happy since covid struck. went to med school, got a girlfriend, met different new people made new friends. but I am just not happy, I don't truly feel it inside. I wish I was happy as I was back in highschool. I just don't know where it all went wrong. I can't pinpoint what led me to this point in my life. I try to be grateful for what I have cause I know there are shit tons of people out there who are dealing with way way more than what I am currently struggling with. but I just don't feel it. I feel alone. sometimes I wish I only had one true friend I can talk to, you know the saying, a friend to all is a friend to none. and my grades are getting bad, I'm having panic attacks, and my self confidence has deteriorated immensely. and Ever since I broke up with my gf I just feel lost. I feel like I'm at the lowest point of my life. I just don't know how to bounce back. I don't know where to start. I just wanted to let it out, thank you"
depression,"Is it normal to have recurring suicidal ideation since teens, despite never acting on it? 28 now, have had continued and recurring suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. Constant thoughts of 'I wish I could sleep forever', or 'I just want to stop existing', or 'Life is terrible, I want to not exist'.  


I've never made detailed plans to do so, as I'm stopped by the guilt of the damage it would do to my family.

&amp;#x200B;

I always thought everyone had these thoughts, but have opened up to some people who've never once wanted to stop living."
depression,Throat pain I have permanent throat tightness and pain since a month. Does any one of you also have that? Does it go away?
depression,"I am going from living in the moment to depressed everyday Literally everyday I try to be hopeful. Me thinking that my life will finally turn around, until that idea gets crushed again. Again and again. I'm so fucking done with it. Only reason I haven't ended it already is because I tried once. Only that felt worse than how I feel on a daily basis. And I try to improve, it even works to some extent. But I only end up feeling worse."
depression,"Hello everyone, I just realised I have spent about 15% of my life so far on games. Hi! Everyone, I'm 17 years old, and I have been in and out of depression for a long long time. During this time I used games as a way to escape the 'real world'. I just calculated my total hours on games. And it was about 10500 hours. That is more then a year!
I did some calculations, and this means that about 15% OF MY ENTIRE LIFE SO FAR, was spent on games. And that is only including steam games.

Right now I'm just going to start reading again, I've been feeling really burned out on gaming anyways.
But damn, 15%."
depression,"Well guess I’m one friend down again God dammit, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

Fuck sake man, I thought me and him were close, he was like a best friend but to him I’m nothing, he’s got best friends, he’s got a lot, he’s way better of a person than me, I jus want to hear him say he cares about me man, like i mattered to him in anyway, but he does not give any fucks about me, im like a bug to him, I was there for him but he can get better and forget about me, he has the perfect life, perfect friends, perfect band, musically talented, popular and he’s a great person but im none of that, im a fucking mess, why do people abandon me? Why me? Did I do something? Say something? What man fuck, I jus want to matter fuck, I want him to talk to me, I want him to realise I love(platonically) the shit out of him, he’s like a brother to me fuck"
depression,"Wish I wish just one year I could have someone who would celebrate my birthday with me where I didn’t have to pay , I have never had that"
depression,A lot of people must be having fun right now. While I'm here being miserable and hoping to end it all. It's so cold.... so painful.
depression,"What have you found most beneficial in pulling yourself out of depression? I'm wondering what everyone has found to definitively assist with reducing deep depressive episode. This could be anything from lifestyle changes, eating habits, medications, supplements, etc."
depression,"Should I document my journey through depression? So I basically just moved across the country and started a new business. I do love the work I do most of the time, but being by myself, moving to a new area, and having a new role as far as work goes has been a lot. Not to mention my on-again-off-again, long distance partner. 
I feel like I’m going actually insane, I’m super unmotivated to the point I barely get out of bed. Im basically bedridden at this point. I’m so stressed and depressed that it’s started to take a toll on my physical health as well, but I know I’m better than this. I’m sure I can’t be the only one feeling this way. Should I record myself throughout my days and note what seems to be working as far as getting better and things that do not help. So kinda like documenting my journey back to happiness/healthiness. I feel like not only would this hold me accountable and motivate me some, but maybe also help or inspire other people that are in a dark place."
depression,"I've Trapped Myself I have trapped myself in this cycle of depression. I want to talk to others about what I truly feel but I'm afraid that I'll hurt them with the true extent of my depression, I also fear that being open will lead to me getting hurt or worse. The way I see it I'm in a situation where only I can save myself."
depression,"I'm losing myself I feel lately that i dont know who i am, the past 5 years I feel like I've been living for other people always wanting the best for everyone and nothing for me. Somehow i got into an IMPORTANT job I'm not even good at it i feel like at this point i am here cause of pity, keep on doing fucking mistakes, but because i am a ""good person"" and always smiling (when in reality in fucking depressed and goes to sleep while crying, but i dont want to work with a gloomy face cause it will make people feel bad) they keep letting me stay while someone MUCH better than me can come in.

My job includes working with A LOT of people, and taking their requests, and trying to do the beat for everyone of them is killing me i focus to much trying to help someone while neglecting someone else but at the same time i dont want to talk to my boss cause i dont want to disappoint him who is a very amazing person.

I literally cannot remember anything from the past 6 years I've been basically living every day separately from the last, someone could ask me what food/movie/hobby and i couldn't answer any of that cause i genuinely dont know. I dont know what i want in life, i dont know my passion.

All i know is that a lot of people depend on me, and the feeling of disappointing someone is killing me.
At this point i am not living for my self I'm living for others. 

Well that was enough whining for no one to care back to work"
depression,"Circumstantial Depression My depression stems from my circumstances. I don't know why my life had to be so difficult. Health issues, financial issues, no support from family/parents. I just feel life is so uncomparable yet we are compared with others."
depression,"Self harm Hi Everyone. I started Self-Harming just over a week ago but have stopped since then. it felt really good to me especially because last week was probably the hardest week of my life, but things have gotten a little better since then however i feel worthless am stressed and relatively depressed and i think i want to start cutting again. I just wanted to know peoples' opinion on this?"
depression,Self awareness does not equate to a solution. And that frustrates me so fucking much. I tried to apply the scientific method on my problems. Its first step is to identify the problem. And did. I know exactly what makes me extremely unmotivated. I know the reasons on why I can't just end myself and the reasons how I became like this. I figured out a long time ago how fucked up my parents' brought us up. I also know the reasons behind their failed attempt of raising us. I know that I need to change something. I know that it's not my fault and at the same time it is. I fucking know. So why can't I move. Why cant i move man. I want to change. I want to die. I want something atleast resembling happiness or contentment. I thought i was numb but im not. It still fucking hurts someone save me pls. Iw ant it to be over fu
depression,Does it ever get better? I used to have goals and a decent social life then I started dating a terrible person I should've known things where not end well but I stayed with the guy in those 3 years I was with him he traumatized me and hurt me in everyway possible. I'm trying to heal from it but it's so hard. I try to move on but he always convinces me to come back and then treats me like shit. At this point his insults have gotten to my head. Everytime he insulted me and told me I'm worthless and everything he said. It's all stuck in my head and I just hate myself now.
depression,"Is there anything worth doing that can help me? From drugs to volunteering. So I’m really in a bad spot in life, I’m not homeless yet but I’m getting there. I’m so unmotivated and everything in my life just reminds me of my shame and mistakes. I cry multiple times a day even at work and can’t hold jobs. And nobody loves me and I mean NOBODY. I’m in a position in life where I can’t use recreational drugs or supplements. All I have are my prescriptions. I only have one friend and even then I don’t think he gives a shit about me we really only hang if we have drugs. I’ve met homeless people that were cheerful than me. I’m so weak, I was born a mistake too. I cry as I write this cause just thinking of the past and were I am in life is a painful living nightmare. I might try suicide by cop cause I don’t have a gun. And it’d be easy all you have to do is get on pain killers and uppers to keep standing. Fuck I’m ranting. Whatever idk. Is their anyone else in my positions like this? Were everything in life is just horrible. I know a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to that but I mean like my life being lonely, empty, and being a person that’s unloved for everything. Is there anything worth doing to feel better? From drugs to volunteering. Yes I repeated myself."
depression,"progress Hi, new to the sub. Long time sufferer of depression and always take the little victories.

Today is one of those.. I've been in bed miserable and not motivated to do anything for around a week now. Only getting up to use the toilet. I didn't have any food for the majority of it and I don't have a support network around me. Such is life.

Anyway, today I'm feeling positive for a change. I've not only got out of bed, but I've talked myself into cleaning my room from top to bottom, put my bed sheets in the wash.

Who doesn't love fresh bed sheets!?

Future me (around 6 hours from now) is going to be so happy with this decision.

Power to you all, big love. You got this"
depression,I want to end my suffering Going through the worst month of my life. I’m scared. I’m going through one of my worst fears. I’m tired of worrying everyday. I feel so ugly. I can’t escape what’s happening to me. I’m so stressed out and I just want to die. I haven’t been able to go to school this week because of how depressed I am. I fear it’s going to only get worse and it’ll become noticeable soon. Or worse it is something that is lifelong and I will need medication.
depression,"The worst/hardest part about depression in my opinion is the need to hide your tears Not meant as an advice in any way but I always feel the need to hide tears, sudden crying spells from beloved ones because I don't want them to fell concerned or sad.
Makes me feel alone even more..."
depression,"Finally beat depression (for now) It has been a long 3 years. I can’t even explain how low I was. Suicide was the only thing on my mind for the longest time and I could barely get out of bad. After all the panic attacks, days where I couldn’t even look in the mirror, days I couldn’t even go outside, I finally feel like my old self. I hope all of you keep fighting this awful disease. Whether you’re genetically predisposed to it or you’ve just had a shit life, keep on moving. I finally have that sparkle in my eye again that I haven’t had in so long. If anyone has any questions or wants advice don’t hesitate. I want to help anyone I can because I’ve been there and I relate with you. If I can dig out of the hole then anyone can. Obviously a relapse is possible, but I’m going to appreciate the good times. Much love everyone."
depression,Ever feel like you're just existing? Like just eat sleep and repeat?
depression,"I don’t know how to help… My sister/brother/sibling is trans and heavily depressed, and I get it, I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life, but I coped with it. My sister on the other hand seems to have made this her entire personality, she doesn’t clean, self care is minimal, she lounges all day, goes to work, comes straight home and can’t be bothered to do anything else. Perhaps it’s my ego, and I know everyone is different, but I cannot comprehend how a 21 year old full of life just quite literally be living dead. I am in no way being insensible, there’s plenty more below the surface, but how can I help?! My family doesn’t know how to help her/him/they whatever they wanna be and whenever we attempt to reach out we are met with anger and ongoing excuses. We’re scared they’ll one day hurt themselves or fall into hard drugs, she wants to transition to be a man and said she never came out or did anything about it out of fear of what our parents would say, but a year ago she came out to the family and while it’s been a rollercoaster she’s had the opportunity to start at least even dressing like a dude but all she’s doing is injecting herself with hormones has a deep voice now but still insists on dressing like a woman and being a girly????????? plz don’t get me started on the 500 genders shit either cuz I cannot comprehend and believe me I’ve tried…as a gay man myself I’ve come to realize I’m not as open minded as I thought I was cuz holy shit if only you guys knew the pain this has been to witness. Also I calll them she as that’s my baby sister it’s gonna take me a lifetime to get used to it so don’t start attacking me now."
depression,"should i give up my depressed boyfriend? We had a very rough time last week. He told me the other day that he is not confused if he loves me or not but rather confused if he's ready to fully commit to a relationship while his life isn't together yet. I totally understand that. But what I am holding onto is ""What if he doesn't really want us to end? What if it's his depression who's thinking that way.""

I want to stay and make him feel that he's not gonna be alone anymore. That there's someone he can rely on even if he's not the type of person who shares his thoughts. But the thing is, he won't talk to me. He isn't replying to my messages for 2 days already. But I don't want to call him because that might annoy him more. 

How do I make him feel loved? I don't think my words are enough to pull him from the dark. I wish I could go to him and hug him. I want to stay, but I think my presence in his life only annoys him more."
depression,"I cannot hold it anymore.... Now I understand why some people get addicted to drugs and alcohol. It is not easy to face and accept some things. I understand why people want to die, it's not really about dying but just not wanting to face anything anymore.....just forget and leave everything for fuck's sake. Getting tired of living in a shithole full of triggers and things that we don't want to deal with.


Honestly, I now understand the state of ""bad"" people in a way. They are not bad but just pathetic. They are less aware than average. This doesn't mean I support them.....I just feel like my present state is no less pathetic. But I cannot jump into actions since I am aware. Fuck it!


I don't want to live, I don't want to do or care about anything anymore. I fucking care for things I don't have to. I am tired of it. I feel so much that I get exhausted. WHY DO I CARE LIKE IT IS IN MY INSTINCT?????? I don't want to care, I don't want to care, I don't want to care!! But I know, I still care.........lol.


I am afraid of facing my emotions. They are freaking deep, intense and confusing. I don't want to deal with it. I don't want to have them. Better feel nothing or fall in coma. I don't want to understand anyone. Not anymore. I don't want to deal with people though I am still relying on them. I don't want to face the world...nor people..nor myself. It's freaky and exhausting.


Can I just die? I don't want to carry on with my life. Sometimes I want to bang my head till it gets damaged. I want to hurt myself till I get satisfied......I feel desperate to do so. But I didn’t. I never harmed myself......I want to just cut my wrist and die. But I never tried it nor thought of trying...I really want to die but I don't do it. I don't feel like I will try it one day. Like even if I have tools in infront of my eyes all the time.....I don't think I will ever pick them up to use. I don't have any addictions either! I don't do anything that makes me forget about myself.....I am always aware....which is terrifying. I feel like a trapped mouse. I just want liberation from everything but what I am currently doing is facing myself...I want to cry......but I can't even cry anymore. I have to squeeze every single drop forcefully to cry, which is exhausting.


I somehow I feel like I know my self and my life more than my brain and emotions......the depression, anxiety and the thoughts of wanting to end everything is just my mind's struggle since it is now exposed to every dark thought and memory of mine. Like a child throwing a tantrum to take tablets because they don't want to taste the bitterness,......though they know it only makes their condition better.....I am just afraid of myself. Though I don't have a grain of hope that ""it will get better""....I somehow know what am I doing, what should I do and where will I end up. But at the same time, I don't know. Idk what is happening or what will happen.


My state is unknown to myself. People often ask what has happened to me. I don't know either. I badly want to vent about my state but I don't know enough to do so. I am depressed but also not. I am anxious but also not. I am suicidal but also not. I am pathetic but also not......I cannot relate to anyone....not the depressed ones nor the cheerful and ""normal"" ones. In short, I am in a Lala Land. Fully aware have no idea about what is happening or what to do about it. But I am still living. I am living on my instincts....like someone is controlling me. I don't know where will I end up...what is my future. I am just carrying on. I feel terribly lonely. Very, very lonely. But I don't want to deal with people. This loneliness is better than people."
depression,"Instead of things ""getting better"", life just continues to fuck me even harder with each passing day People are always telling me that ""it gets better"". When? Life just gets WORSE every day. Just when I think things couldn't get any worse, when things couldn't get any lower, some new fucked up thing happens to me. I swear I'm losing it, I'm just losing it. For several years, things have just been getting worse, and worse, and worse. Someone literally SCREAMED at me today and threatened me over literally nothing, literally was minding the fuck out of my own business as I always do. 

I'm just so sick of it. I'm so sick of other people, I'm so sick of this fucked up world. I literally can't be happy for just ONE day. Every day is just torture. I hate this shit. Nobody understands, nobody understands at all. Talking about my problems opens me up to relentless criticism and shit like ""why don't you just not be depressed bro it's easy lol maybe you need to man up and stop crying like a bitch, maybe it's just all your fault, sorry you suck so bad lol not my problem"". Or I get people who think they're being so helpful by suggesting ""therapy"", when I've been in therapy 7 years. I've sought counsellors and psychiatric help as well. Nothing changes how miserable my life is. ""Thinking positive"" doesn't stop fucked up things from happening to me, it doesn't stop my suffering at all. 

If only I had NEARLY as easy as other people, where it was all just as simple as ""thinking happy thoughts"". At this point I'm convinced that there's literally nothing that will ever save me from this shit. I can't take much more of this. I can say with confidence that I would rather be fucking dead than live the rest of my life just repeatedly getting FUCKED by life every single day."
depression,"17 dropped out of school I dropped out of school when I was 15 in freshman year when I got expelled from there for coming to school high ever since then I’ve been bullshitting not getting anything done I got anxiety and it’s hard for me to talk to people, I don’t know where to start anymore I really don’t want to be here anymore"
depression,"I feel like I ruin every good thing in my life, and I don’t understand how or why I’ve felt like this for a long time. I’m in my early 20s, but remember having similar thoughts when I was as young as 15. I tend to lose the good things in my life, whether that’s friends, closer relationships, or smaller things. I try, so incredibly hard to be a good person. I try to be a good friend. I try to be a good boyfriend. And I’m scared. 

I’m currently going through a really dark phase for reasons I’d rather not discuss, and it feels especially bad right now. I feel ignored, I feel useless, I feel like the background character. Not by everyone, of course. I have some very great people in my life that are largely the reason I’m still around today. But by most. 

I feel like I attach myself onto someone more than I want to. I get emotionally attached very quickly, and much more strongly than most, I think. To me, someone can be an extremely important figure in my life. To them, I’m nothing but “another person”. 

I don’t want this to come off as weird or annoying. I’m a normal person. I have normal friends, normal hobbies, and am by no means socially awkward or strange. I just feel *different*, and I’ve felt this way for a long time. It’s hard to explain even at the best of times, and I’m not really sure why I’m typing this at all. I don’t expect anyone to understand. I guess there’s just some comfort in posting something so publicly, yet so privately at the same time. 

I just want to understand why I find myself to be more involved with others than they want to be with me. Surely it’s something to do with myself, as I’m the only constant. I just don’t even know where to start trying to understand myself. I’m crying as I’m typing this, half because it’s relieving, and half because I’m thinking of people that are no longer in my life that I’d grow strong emotional attachments to. 

At the end of the day, I should be happy, on paper. I’ve got some great people in my circle, I make good money doing what I love, I’m able to travel for months out of the year without worry. I just feel off. I feel different. I feel lonely. I feel like nobody really knows me, and that is terrifying. 

On days like today, I literally can’t fathom being alive for another 60 odd years. It’s difficult to get through a day. I just don’t know what to do, or how to feel better. I’m trying, so incredibly hard, every single day. I make myself do things, be productive, lead an active life. But far too often, it feels like there’s no point in any of it at all. 

If anyone read this, thanks, and sorry for the mumbo jumbo. I’m not really looking for answers here, mostly just typing into the void because it feels good. I hope you’re doing a bit better than I am tonight. ♥️"
depression,"Getting over feeling SO TIRED all the time? I’m 21, been depressed for years, tried to sort it many times but feel I need to now more than ever before it becomes a forever thing. How do I stop being SO tired 24/7? I wake up at 7:30/8am every day for the dog whilst everyone’s at work and I wake up so dizzy and struggle to get up. I always think it’s because I’ve just woke up and it’ll go away but the feeling just stays. Even just walking around becomes a chore, and I’m too tired to even make breakfast like I just don’t have the energy.. which I know of course makes it worse. I can’t even describe how bad it feels, and it’s annoying because I can’t shake it. I have trouble with my eating anyway so that’s also a problem because it makes me really weak anyway but aside from that.. I also stay in bed pretty much all day every day unless I’m at work (obvs have reasons for that), so I guess my body just isn’t used to doing much. I don’t know what to do but it’s so hard when you’re not only just feeling ill mentally but physically too."
depression,"i feel sad because I am sad because I dont have a goal. Ive put on weight because i have been stressed because i dont have a goal and im struggling to make music because im putting too much pressure on myself to be successful.

I think the idea of myself is inhibiting me from becoming who i want to be because its such a big step and ive fallen down because i let the gap get bigger until now it feels impossible.

Im not sure if some childhood problems tie into this somehow, but i do know that this weekend felt exhausting because i did absolutely nothing bevause I couldnt do anything.

I have renewed my subscription for a calorie counting app today and ill skip breakfast because i want to have a sense of self control. I wont produce music later because I think i need to concentrate on me for a little while.

I need time but i dont have it, im scared now and anxious that i wont ever be this person I want to become but i will be depressed if i stay here. My mental health is not well, i need to do better, one step at a time."
depression,"its my fault Two months ago my partner of 7 years left me.  I've been severely depressed because I thought she was the one.   But now I've noticed alot of my depression is stemming from my life.  Live with my mom at 26 years old now (rent is insane for a single man to live on his on), don't drive currently(i want to learn), have no friends and no social life to meet new people, work overnight retail.  I feel I will never meet the true ""one"" for me as I have such a crap life.  I have no dating experience as we started dating straight out of high-school.  Social anxiety and now depression keep me locked up like a bird in a cage.  Any time I feel like I get over her I have a bad mental day or because everything reminds me of her and constantly miss her again.  I just want to be as happy as I was when I was with my ex partner.  I just dont know what to do.  I want to start over but I can't magically just start a new life elsewhere. Sorry"
depression,"First time seeing a Psychiatrist what to expect? Hello, so I am currently seeing a therapist who diagnosed me with severe anxiety &amp; severe depression along with OCD &amp; Compulsions. He referred me to a psychiatrist to get medication, because of how this is really affecting me daily. I want to get help. Also, it took me forever to actually get this appt. I am a hypochondriac as well so I hate being on any kind of medication because the side effects scare me. So, what do you think I will get prescribed based on this? I'm just want to see what others are taking &amp; if it's for similar things to me. Please I want to read up on some different medications so let me know! Thank you."
depression,"My life is at a standstill, but I have nowhere to go anyway It’s amazing how your life can be so full of opportunity and hope in one moment, and then in the next it crumbles to pieces. You work so diligently, consistently, and passionately to fulfill your goals, but one simple, innocent mistake ruins it all. 

Failure really shouldn’t be that simple.

Now my depression is wide awake again after resting for a few months. I am trying so hard to find the motivation to keep going, but based on my history, it is likely not worth the effort. Maybe I should accept that my life isn’t meant to improve. What if I am stuck in this misery forever? The worst part is not knowing if it can get worse or if it can get better, and when and how. At this point I am too afraid to risk anything. I fear how much worse it could get."
depression,"I Have Completely Closed Myself Off From New Experiences. Im in ego jail right now. My ego won't allow me to make new friends and meet new people unless I'm the ""alpha"". Horribly insecure, I know. there was a time when I was just happy to be part of the crowd. Happily took stupid food service jobs, and made friends. And then what happened? 

&amp;#x200B;

I had some bad experiences with women. Then I had some bad experiences with drinking. So I guess I said ""either Im the star player or I quit."" And I quit alright. 

I went out to the bars on Saturday night, and I didn't feel chill at all. Stayed sober, drank a lot of coffee.. got frustrated that I couldn't let loose and try to meet some women.  

&amp;#x200B;

My mind only reads binary code. 1s or 0s.Red lights or green lights. So if I can't drink, and I can't be a hedonist, then I just give up. 

If I can't have it all then I don't want it at all. The ultimate toxic mindset. Its gotta be remedied."
depression,"I peaked by being popular in high school but my peak wasn’t even fun because I was in the closet and miserable. I’m an adult now. I’m extremely down, have no money, no friends, still in the closet, my relationship is on the rocks, I have nothing to look forward to. I just don’t see the point."
depression,"I’m absolutely terrified. 28 years and I’m snapping I’m out of my body, my mind.. I snapped. I don’t even feel like I’m me any more. I’m a goner. I’m terrified. This part of my mind is trying to Fucking kill me guys. It’s winning. This fucking illness. I’m done. Nobody should have to burry their son. But sometimes you have to. Sorry mom.. I don’t know. Fuck."
depression,"Missed a thing I was looking forward to, realized how few things I can go and do outside of my house and enjoy I spent most of my stupid fucking day today playing video games with a mate that I play with fairly often and it totally slipped me by that this one-off screening of a movie called 'Z' was happening at a cinema near me that I had been looking forward to for weeks and had already bought a ticket for. I realized about an hour ago- way after the movie was finished- that I was supposed to do that today and it just made me feel utterly sick to the stomach. I've got nothing coming up anytime soon that I'm looking forward to doing, no special thing or great movie at the cinema or anything. That was what was supposed to tide me over until the next thing came along. I'm pissed at myself and feel like absolute shit.

But yeah as per title, it's got me thinking now how absurdly deprived I am of things to do and enjoy outside of my house. I've got no friends in the real world as is and only one online friend. I don't know, most things aren't really worth doing at all on my own (save me the learn to enjoy yourself on your own spiel, I've been attempting that for 6 or 7 years and am 22 now). Yeah I go walking about in my city fairly often but that's not exactly fun on my own, if anything it's kind of a source of fairly passive anxiety and feelings of pointlessness- asking myself why I'm even bothering wandering around, going to cafes, browsing in shops, whatever. 

I cannot for the life of me think of any hobby or specialty club or specific activity I would actually enjoy. I know myself pretty well, and I know what I find interesting. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this here. My life is utterly vacuous, I'm so sick of it, I have no clue what I'm supposed to do to undo years of isolation and trauma/guardedness as a result of monumentally fucking up in emotional outbursts as soon as I even have the barest sense that I'm forming a connection with the few people I've met that this has happened with in the past few years. I'm worn down, bored as fuck, and feel a pressing impossibility of substantially altering the way my life is and making anything worthwhile. I'm not suicidal at the moment, I'm thinking I'll get around to that when I'm 24 if my life is still the same way despite any efforts along the way.

Anyway. Yeah. Don't know what to do now. I'm tired."
depression,"Someone please help me. I’m an 17 year old boy from Australia, and I have been suffering badly. My whole life feels like it’s caving in on itself and I have these hopes and dreams of becoming an actor that just feel too hard to achieve. 

About 4 months ago I got reluctantly diagnosed with ADHD as my parents think mental health is bullshit so it took a lot of arguing and fighting to finally make it happen. I felt like it was the best thing to ever happen to me since I finally understood why I feel and act the way I do. I thought this was a major turning point in my life but I was mistaken. 

For about 4 months I have been on Ritalin and in all honesty I don’t feel that much different and I have major side affects such as extreme mood swings which is odd as I had that before the meds but now it feels as if it’s much more severe. The meds help a bit throughout the day but as I ease off them at night that’s when the feeling of complete darkness and emptiness kicks in. I feel depressed, horrible and sometimes have terrible thoughts that i'm scared i might go through with. I feel alone and extremely reserved at times then the next day i'm the kid making all the jokes and making people around me laugh and smile. I feel like a sad clown paradox and i don't know why, i just wish i know whats wrong with me so i can fix it because i feel terrible on the inside. I suspected it was the meds at first so i laid off taking them for a week but still felt depressed. Ive been smoking these stupid vapes for almost 2 years and been heavily addicted to porn since year 3 or 4 so i tried quitting but it was so hard i just gave up. Then i thought maybe the depression is caused by the trauma i endured for most my life by my parents, i though about all the times my parents beat me up or kicked me and verbally abused me but even with all of that i still don't think my depression is caused my that. 

Maybe its caused by all these bits and pieces in my life, i really don't know. I just need help and i don't know where to go for it anymore."
depression,"Has depression destroyed my relationship? Please help me :( I am absolutely desperate and have not lived properly for 2 years.

I have already searched so much on the internet for help, have been in therapy for 1.5 years (with small interruptions) and take medication. Nothing really got better. Please help me.

My depression is very closely connected with my ex-girlfriend. I have been mainly concerned with how she may have caused my depression, but not how the depression has affected my relationship.

**Back story:**

I met my ex in the summer of 2020. I was 26 and had never had a girlfriend or been in love. We both fell completely in love and had a wonderful summer. So many things about her I loved. At the time I was supposed to start a master's abroad in the fall just like her in different countries. We weren't a couple at that point, but she really wanted to keep in touch and also wanted me to come visit her. She was really lovebombing. 

Once abroad, she reduced the contact after only 3 weeks and finally told me that she had no more feelings. No feelings at all! How does something like this happen after 3 weeks. Even then I knew that she had commitment problems. I didn't think we would get together right now, but not that she would break everything off right away.

**My first depressive phase:**

I then became really really severely depressed. I dropped out of my master's program and went back to our hometown. I could hardly stand up, tried a lot of drugs at that time, and was almost admitted to a clinic. It got a little better with therapy and medication. At the same time as the antidepressants, I learned that she was coming back from abroad from a friend. This probably also raised my mood.

**Summer 2021, the return:**

In the summer of 2021, she then came back. We met, and we immediately fell in love again. It was sick. Almost on the first evening she remembered how much she liked me. 3-4 weeks later we were in a relationship.

My depressive symptoms greatly decreased, but were never completely gone. Honestly, I wasn't as happy as I should be. The breach of trust from 2020 and the whole year were just way too burdening still.

During the relationship, I therefore understandably had major trust issues and jealousy problems. My depression was still clearly there. I was still not very productive and empty, but the good feelings through the relationship covered it up. 

The relationship was completely chaotic and toxic. My ex had many mental health issues. She has ADHD, complex PTSD, I also suspect Borderline, an anxiety disorder, and childhood trauma. She was beaten and controlled by her mother. On top of that she started a job as an investment banker working 80 hrs.

There were also major intimacy issues. She took a long time to engage in sex and even cried once after sex because she felt used. This became a big problem. Before the relationship she was already very promiscuous and she seemed very open. This made my jealousy and complexes even bigger. She also had many male friends. In general, she was often dismissive and then affectionate again. Sometimes I had to caress her for 20 minutes so that she could have sex. Then she wanted to have sex again in crazy places and constantly announced to try any sex practices with me. None of it happened.

I finally broke up with her after 8 months, even though I still loved her very much.

**The breakup and my second depressive episode:**

In the breakup conversation, I cried all the time. I told her about my bad year. She knew before that I was depressed (because of the first breakup), but this time I opened up completely. I also told her that I often felt disgusting and could hardly touch her.

3 days later she had sex with someone else. 2 days later she took another guy home from the club. 1 day later she insulted me. Then she apologized and wanted to talk. I missed her and agreed. We talked 4 hrs and she told how she wanted to change and admitted so many mistakes. The next day I found out about her ONS and completely freaked out and insulted her as well. I apoligized and we had no contact since then. It was the first time I was mean to her or mean to anyone in my life.

After that she had sex with one of her buddies that I was jealous of and she had sex with her boss at the office.

I am completely devastated. It's been 6 months now. I have a huge complex. I feel worthless. I am so scared that I communicated way too poorly during the relationship. There were so many good things that maybe I didn't realize because of the depression. She slept at my place almost every day (without having sex most of the time) and we did a lot together towards the end. I have never met a women I would rather spend time with.  


Have I done a mistake? Did my depression weaken my decision skills? She didnt want to break up. I want her to know how badly I'm hurt and that my depression is back."
depression,"I feel like I'm losing myself (excuse my ranting). I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I hope this still gets the message across. Currently, I'm entering my middle high school years. My mom divorced 6 years ago, and my brother is busy with his job. I'm writing this because I can no longer keep it to myself.

In the past 4 or so years, my mother has been progressively becoming a different person. She has become more socially awkward and her conversations with strangers... well, they aren't particularly fluent anymore. I can see that she is giving it her all, trying to support me and give love in the ways she can, but I don't think she realizes that the way she expresses her love for me isn't helping me anymore.

Continuing on, during the last few years of her decline, she has mixed her rage and sadness and regularly shits on me for my mistakes. She compares me to a ""future me,"" where I won't be a successful person, describing my hypothetical life with a low-quality job and little pay. For example, she says if I don't read enough books, I won't make it into a prestigious college and I won't be able to get the jobs I desire.

In 6th grade, COVID and online classes had really displaced me. I found myself distracted and unable to keep up with the ridiculous workload that my teachers had put on me. One day, I overslept and missed the mandatory morning check-in my class did on school days. My teacher sent my mom an email expressing her concern that I hadn't shown up. This, combined with the fact that I had missed schoolwork, drove her over the edge. Yeah, it wasn't fun. In my tears and storm of emotions, I told her how I felt. How it wasn't fair and how I wanted to commit suicide (keep in mind I had little support and no one else to talk to). She simply disregarded my suicide comment and just carried on with her tsunami of rage.

She also didn't like the fact that I was losing certain interests and hobbies (maybe just adolescence). So she would use the same tactic, saying I wouldn't go anywhere in life without interests and hobbies. She went as far as to force me to get back into hobbies I'd left.

My brother was visiting us for a little family reunion during the holidays. As per usual, my mom and I got into a heated argument. She started to use some questionable tactics to get me to back down when my brother stepped in and defended me. With the escalating argument, my brother took the lead, telling her that how she was treating me was not okay. She spit out all her hatred for my imperfections that night, and my brother had to check in on me afterwards to make sure I was okay. I still love him more than ever because of that.

To this day, I no longer tell my mother about my achievements. The days of ""look mom"" or ""check this out"" are over. I am just waiting till the day I turn 18. 

**Yes, I received counseling in elementary school. However, I have lost touch with my elementary school counselor.**

I don't know if I'm just a pussy or if there's something I can do. I'm clinging onto my sanity."
depression,"Sorry 
This is probably going to be a very long post so apologies in advance if you still end up reading it all. (Keep in mind Im not in a very good state right now and have a lack of sleep so this so this won’t be typed out very well.) I am mentally exhausted from life in general. Currently jobless been out of work for only 5 days (worked as an electrician for a year but got let go) these days have been very draining I am very low on money so there is not much I can do. I have only left the house to go to the gym down the road from me. The gym was the only thing I’ve looked forward to but it seems like I can’t get much enjoyment doing anything anymore. Recently broke up with 2 year long relationship with gf about a month ago I saw she was texting other guys and I told her to leave and we haven’t talked or texted each other since that day. These last few days have made me feel so exhausted despite not doing much. I’d have outbursts of rage and/or sadness. I’ve realized that thinking back through my life (currently 20 male) it’s been terrible I have so many bad memories (not to say my life is so much worse than anyone else it could always be worse than it is now) having to deal with parents splitting up, fighting sometimes physically, growing up watching my dad getting arrested, fighting with other girlfriends etc. it wasn’t and still isn’t very involved in my life. Last time I saw him about a year ago I went to see him the weekend after his birthday and asked instead of hanging out with me he asked me to babysit his new girlfriends kid while they went to the bar I ended up doing it but don’t have much of a desire to see him after that day. 
I used to look up to him when I was a kid but now I see how much of a loser he is with a lack of caring. There were often times when my mom would drop me off at his house for the weekend I had to sleep in the car with me during the winter due to the fights he would get into with a roommate or gf of his. 
I didn’t realize until recently that while I was in a car I was on the phone with my grandpa i realized on that day he was on the phone with me for so long because he was distracting me from my dad being arrested which is why he also picked me up. My grandpa was more of a father figure for me which pains me more thinking about him dying, watching his rib cage  break from being given cpr is so painful of a memory to look back too. I also think during middle school when I had terrible acne and was also very scrawny and shy which wasn’t a very fun time. Going into highschool I got a little of a glow up from being forced by my cousin to go to his wrestling practices and working out with him, I changed as a person very quickly. But it was brutal during the school year I would get beat after wrestling practices. I finished out my year but didn’t sign up for another one much of my family was disappointed but I couldn’t handle more of it so I went for swimming sophomore year which I enjoyed but had to stop and work my junior year so I could buy a car to drive and pay for insurance. It kinda bummed me out not doing Athletics but I still got to workout in my spare time which I enjoyed it was one of the few things I looked forward too. Shortly before I graduated I met a girl I thought I was going to spent the rest of my life with I loved her and her family, they were so generous and close as a family it made me jealous and wish my family was like that. During her graduation she had a big party for it, I thought in the bad of my head that I wish I could have a party with this many people that care for me. Our relationship begin to sour after the first time I saw her texting guys so we argued, made up and got back together but our relationship was never the same, she said about once a month she would lose feelings for me but they would come back later. I’m not sure if that’s normal but it was difficult to go through I tried so hard to hold on with her despite her being hateful to me, I loved her so much, but it didn’t work. I realized I’ve never really got to go on many trips the farthest I’ve went is Dallas which is 4 hours from me for a funeral. I had a fishing guide planned with a friend in lake texoma it was 400 and we planned to split, he canceled on me a few days before (yes I paid a direct deposit in case that happened) so I just sat at my house feeling sorry for myself on my birthday weekend. I don’t really get to do much most weekends. I don’t have very many friends I got better at being more social but not at a point to where I stood out. I could keep going on and on about how sad I am about my life. 
I haven’t eaten anything today due to how low on food I am, I went to the gym today but didn’t enjoy it. I had a job lined up for next week but I don’t know if I want to do it anymore. I hate my life, it’s miserable, I hate my fucking life, I don’t like anything anymore, i don’t sleep, i have no actual friends, no social life and I’m fucking miserable. At this point I’m highly considering scrapping all the money I have left to go to a beach so I do something I’ve wanted to do with my life then shoot myself."
depression,"On vacation I‘m on vacation right now. I should be happy, but I‘m not.
Other people can‘t even go on vacation and I‘m lying here, crying and hurting myself. 
I started crying because I saw myself in a Bikini and can‘t stop it.
I‘ve failed in life and everyone is trying to help me, but I can‘t. I can‘t change myself.

I don‘t understand, why I‘m like that. Why I‘m hurting so much. Why does everything hurts so much"
depression,"Ruining everything I don't usually post my problems but I feel truly alone at the moment with what is happening in my head and I just want to know if I'm not just a bad person. My really bad depressive episodes leave huge memory gaps and confusions in my head that end up making me look like a liar or a someone who wants nothing but to mislead those around me. I worry that one day I'll just be constantly confused and awfully depressed along with it, and no one will understand why because I'll just seem like a liar. I feel like a very big disadvantage to anyone involved with me because of this (friends, family, romantic)"
depression,"My fear of dying is the only reason I’m alive. 28m. I tried to make this short but this is as short as I can make it. I badly suffer from two health problems that keep getting worse and will never go away. Between them both, not a moment goes by where I’m not suffering.

I developed terrible IBS and food intolerance after taking Accutane when I was a teenager and it ruined my digestive system. If I eat a sandwich, I’ll be curled up in the fetal position for the next 12 hours holding back tears feeling like I’m pushing bricks through my guts while I bloat up like a blimp. It’s so painful and frequent that it doesn’t even feel like real life anymore.

I’ve also developed a severe anxiety and panic disorder (I suspect my poor gut health has a lot to do with it). It’s so bad that I can’t leave home, I can’t work, I can’t drive, I can’t sleep and I’m on disability for it. I have anxiety 24/7 and get multiple panic attacks every day and night. All I can do is roll around in my bed panicking while my stomach is in agony.

I’ve spent years like this. And this is my entire life. Yes, you heard right. My entire life consists of this and only this. I haven’t left home in months. I truly don’t want to live anymore. These health issues are not going to go away, but I’m too afraid of dying. If there’s a hell, I’m already here."
depression,"I'm really trying My HR at work noticed that I was ""looking down"" and asked me about it. All alarm bells went off in my head as if I was being discovered for something horrible. Felt ashamed and like an idiot. So now I'm trying even harder than before to appear happy. Having a drink for breakfast seems to help too. But I'm not looking forward to where this will end"
depression,"I am gonna do it I can’t take this anymore. I hate where I live, I hate myself, I hate my profession, I hate my personality and that I have no friends. I hate myself for being stupid and meeting the guy who sexua11y assaulted me, I hate that the only people who love me are my family (they have to love me because i am their daughter or sister, not because they like me). I feel hopeless, useless and stupid."
depression,"Just having a really bad day A really bad couple months, honestly, almost half a year.

depression,"does therapy actually help? ok first of all I'm (17F) I've never been to therapy before and I'm not even sure if i have depression or it's just a burnout or something like that but i know i have a problem so.. 
will therapy really help me then? I've seen a lot of people say that therapy didn't help .. so i wanted to know what the majority thinks"
depression,why does no one wants to talk to me no matter how kind i am to them. its been real lonely these days. people want to be my friends irl but later on they tend to ignore me. Am I overthinking this too much or idk man it just sucks when you don't have anyone to have talks with...
depression,"I miss being a child. Okay so first off I am 15 years old, which as you may or may not know, is still really young.

However, I really miss being around the age of 6-10 years old, not saying I don't like being more mature and not knowing the things I know today, but I miss how my life was back then.

This all comes down to the more social aspect of life.

I'm a pretty introverted and shy person, I do have a few real life friends and some online friends (I'd say I'm more closer to the online ones btw) but I don't really wanna go out and meet new people. I'm saying this because I will start high school soon.

Anyways, when I was younger, I lived and still live in a countryside area that isn't too far from the city. My kindergarten, middle school and high school are all in the city btw.

When I was younger, I was one of the only kids in my neighborhood that had internet access, so I spent most of my time either on a laptop or in front of the TV watching cartoons and playing with toys, which is something most kids do.

My point is, I never really tried being friends with the people around me, I wasn't really shy but I didn't care that much about making friends, my family loved me a lot and maybe even spoiled me a bit too much, but that was enough for me.

In kindergarten I managed to make a friend or 2, I don't remember how but I also went to middle school with them.

In middle school I had a lot of friendships, some stayed, others went away. I was never a ""cool"" kid, I was a pretty weird and goofy person but most people ""liked"" me I think. In my first years I was known as the ""funny kid"" sorta, I knew how to make others laugh, but that kinda stopped by 5th grade as I became more and more shy and quiet.

By the end of middle school I had a group of friends, they are pretty crude people but we get along most of the time.

I haven't really talked with them much but I will go to the same school as one of them, just not in the same class.

But I'm getting a bit offtopic here, I felt I needed to say that to give you a little backround.

I am extremely anxious about the way my life is heading. I miss being a kid. Back then I didn't have to socialize too much and no one really expected much from me. I could just have fun and have no worries.

It was also easier to befriend people, because everyone my age was just like me.

Now, I have a harder time to relate to them, they all seem so ""cool"" and street smart and have this angst to them. I don't really like these types of people. Not saying everyone my age is like that, there are people who are more nice and considerate, also, being the way I described isn't even that bad, it's just not something I'm into.

Now with high school coming up, everyone expects me to make new friends and start dating, but I don't really wanna do that, but I also don't wanna be seen as a weirdo with no life. It's weird.

I also in a way do wanna date since I'm scared I'll never find a girlfriend and I'll just be forever for my entire life until I die.

I just don't like the vibe of school anymore, I wish I could just skip it but still somehow manage to succeed in life.

But that's not how the world works, I have to adapt and get out of my comfort zone, but I don't want to, that's the problem.

I feel as if I'm too self aware but I don't really do anything about it.

Idk its weird, I just wanna live the life I had when I was younger and not worry about anything and just chill.

This post is pretty long, I just wanted to vent a little.

Thanks for reading though, hopefully I didn't come off as an asshole.

Feedback and tips are always appreciated."
depression,"I feel so empty, yet I can hardly contain myself. I’m tired of people pleasing. Every night I feel like I’m on the brink of tears. Constant breakdowns and headaches. I don’t think I can make it to my 18th birthday. 

I feel like in all aspects of my life I’ve tried to reach out for help but either I wasn’t taken seriously or it led to dead ends.

My days are so repetitive. If I’m not constantly sleeping, I’m just staring at my ceiling. i’m tired of dealing with my mom‘s shit, I’m tired of her constant yelling and I’m tired of not being able to have problems of my own. I’m tired of talking to people who tell me they care because I feel like a burden. I don’t want sympathy. I just want to end. I see no future for myself despite it being planned out. The little moments of happiness I get mean nothing because it’s always replace with constant irritation and I don’t know where any of it is coming from.

I can’t even get peace from sleeping, I keep having nightmares. 

Sometimes I pray something awful what happened to me, I feel like that would fix everything. Everything would be okay if something catastrophic struck me down, even if I live I feel like everything will be just fine. I feel like I’ve done something terrible and I need to be punished I feel like a constant problem on those to lay their eyes on me. I don’t want to be perceived. 


I’m so close to getting the happy ending I’ve always wanted. My 18th birthday, graduating high school, finally moving out into a college dorm. I have so much to look forward to but I can’t cope, why does it hurt more. Why does the itching feeling intensifies when I’m so close to the end. I was excited to experience a new life but I want to fall out my window and not be found.

I’m scared this feeling is constant, I’m scared that even when I to get out of this hell hole it’ll sprout up, that I’ll never get rid of it. No one takes me seriously, and I want to stop breathing. I hurt myself and my mom took the means of harming myself away but she never talked to me about it. I don’t think she cares. I didn’t do it for attention but what kind of mother doesn’t ask why? 

I never fell into self harm until those few days where I did it consecutively as a means to get a grip. I felt like I was falling apart but when I was able to go home and repeat my actions I felt like I had some type of control. She took that away for me.

I want to take myself away from her. I want to write a note blaming her for everything. I wish she gave me my tools back so I could make the itching stop. My suicidal tendencies weren’t as extreme but now that I can’t do anything about them that isn’t permanent I feel stuck. I hate that I feel this way, I keep making excuses for her and keep blaming myself and it makes me feel worse. I love her, really I do. But it never feels like she loves me, I feel tolerated at most."
depression,"i hate myself Why can't I just not think about anything. I want to die but I'm scared to die but it'll ease my pain. I always say shit and do shit that I'll regret. I feel like I'm pushing everyone away. I thought I got better but I'm not. Why can't I be better?

Maybe I just want to disappear."
depression,"always thought it was just teenagehood Recently I turned 18(m) and I keep getting sick from all this pressure I've been putting on myself. I mean my birthday wasn't to great I mean my dad belittled me because I said I wanted to stay with my mom till I was able to move out my now ex broke up with me 2 days after (I will say why if needed but it's not important anymore) the next week I was just belittled more by my father and my mother for being a wuss and not just talking to him plus so much more crap id rather not talk about. So this month has sucked in terms of the month I turned 18 but to get to the point of my title I haven't felt whole in at least 7 years I constantly felt pressure to be the best because of my siblings and it just kept getting harder to keep up as they got older, I always thought this anxiety would get better over time but it just keeps getting worse and worse like right now as I'm writing this I'm honestly crying my eyes out, I don't get why nor do I think it really matters anymore I hate myself so much and I wish I could talk to someone about it but every time I do it just ends up being a horrible decision I probably shouldn't post thus but I don't care anymore it's about time I just listened to people say what they want I know what I'm saying isn't special because so many people deal with it but I can't and at this point I can't find a reason to keep fighting myself I'm not suicidal nor do I physically hurt myself but I can't keep wanting to I can't keep myself in check anymore I'm gonna break soon I can feel it."
depression,"I have no friends And no this isn’t just a phase in my life. I started secondary school with one friend. But I always had this dream to be with the popular kids of my class and so I stopped being friends with him to try and be friends with them. 

And it took me a year and a half to gradually become more friends with them.

But in that time I was really pissed by  one of them. He kept doing the nazi salute and said the n word as a ‘joke’
That isn’t even possible!
My whole family on my dads Side was assassinated by that son of a bitch hitler so when someone doesn’t I physically cannot take it as a joke. So I reminded him firmly constantly. But then I burst 💥 he started making fun of my body image calling me “an obese rat”
And a fat pig. Saying my belly button arrived 15 minutes at school before i did when but I was already deppressed at 12 because of my body image so I exposed him but he just denied it all. 

But since I was the only one who had a problem with him I was kicked out again. And now for 2 months I haven’t spoken to a single person at school just crying at breaktime"
depression,"I don't know what to do. I really don't know if this is the right place for this but idk what to do anymore... I want to commit myself, but the last time I tried they wouldn't take me because I wasn't going to off myself at that moment... I'm more worried that at some point soon ill hurt myself or worse and don't want to be too late... do I just have to lie to get committed? I don't want to do that cuz I feel like that would work against me... there's a tiny bit in me that still wants to get better but I'm so scared that if I don't get admitted soon it'll just be too late..."
depression,lmao I told my parents about how great my friend was I told them that this guy from my school was doing great and much better than I was and that I really looked up to him. I do well in my fucking studies too and my parents were clearly happy with my grades. until I told them about this guy that was better?? all of a sudden it was like my grades were fucking trash?? like I worked hard too did I not? WAS IT MY FUCKING FAULR THAT HE WAS FUCKING SMARTER?? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I COULD'VE DONE?? SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH UR DUMBASS BRUH LIKE HOLY SHIT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I COULD'VE DONE. I COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ANY BETTER BRO FACE IT. I'M NOT THE FUCKING GENIUS YOU EXPECT. I HAVE YOUR FUCKING GENES. YOU KNOW UR FAT ASSES WELL. HOLY FUCK I WANNA DIE

depression,"I'm having negative thoughts now Im college student, even thoug my class start on sept. 12, I feel pressure. And scared.... I imagine Im gonna failed my exam.. what will happen if Im the only one will fail?? What should I do since Im scared to ralk to my teacher and I dont have anyone to talk about it, since I dont have close friend in my university...

So literally having a mental break down now.. Im scared.. my heart felt heavy.. and im crying... i know what capable am i, i know im not smart enough... yeah im a slow learner and i dont have a good memory.. i feel pathetic... im worthless.. and loser.. .."
depression,"pain I always find my self seeking attention and approval from others and it's really getting to me. I want a girl to be interested in me but about a month ago I got out of a toxic relationship and it really hurts me and still kinda haunts me. I know I dont want her back and I believe she ran back to her toxic ex. But I keep thinking how she's gonna crawl back apologizeing. She tried to follow me on insta twice and I tried saying ""hi?"" But she blocked me. I got a bit depressed and angery last night thinking about all this and idk why I still care or why no one eants too talk to me."
depression,"I just wish things were normal I just want to feel alive. I feel trapped or just like some hallucination. I move around like a robot, just so lifeless. I want to feel things, I wish I could laugh like before and just be in the moment. It's always like I'm trapped in the back of my head, and my body is moving on autopilot. I don't know why this is happening to me."
depression,"I wish my best friend hated me She is so absolutely amazing and fantastic, but every time I have a burst of anxiety or depression, regarding our friendship, I can't help but wonder when will she finally have enough of me, when my thoughts and will all my thoughts will be finally enough to make her tired of being with me.

I hate myself so much, and I simply can't understand how I can feel that way while she cares and loves me so much. I keep thinking that maybe she is just trying to make me feel good, or not want to abandon me when I'm like that, even when she literally tells me she don't do any of that.

I think i would better understand her if she became angry at me and hated me and just left me alone. I wish she did. At least that way I won't feel like every word I say about myself and of how insecure I feel is like stabbing her, when she did nothing wrong and constantly tries to reassure me that I'm not hurting her."
depression,"Should I try anymore ? Hi, so I don’t really know if my post will be soon or not but it’s ok either ways so that’s that. I’m a 20 yr guy who loved life and was known for my talkative nature but since the past few years I haven’t been the same and it’s getting worse . I really think I’ve hit the rock bottom now. Something that really triggered me recently was how people I considered “friends” for a year all abandoned me overnight without ANY REASON. It’s like one day we were hanging out and the next day I’m thrown out the group. They all make me feel so worthless, especially seeing them all hang out and just passing by me without saying hello , like I never existed . I’m only human and this hurt me a lot . Also want to add that all my life I wasn’t really good at making friends but it’s not like I never had any, but this really felt like a new beginning. The thing that hurts me the most is how I wasted 8 months on these people and I’m right where I started . I feel so angry and frustrated, would really like to cry but can’t seem to. Hope someone relates . Thank you 😊"
depression,"I’m 19 and I I find it extremely hard to even try and talk to anyone. Better I should just die now. I don't know, I don't even know what to say here in all honesty. I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship. Not to mention I'm high-functioning autistic, so yeah there's that...

depression,"I just start crying … Didn’t used to be that way. I’ll be at work and I’ll feel it begin to come on and I’ll have to run to my custodian closet at work to isolate myself and bawl. Uncontrollably. I realize stressors in my life have begun to take on a shape of unbearableness. I look back and wished I had done more, WAS more. Every single failure I’ve been and each opportunity I’ve let escape, every chance I had to stand up for myself. I’m nothing but pathetic, I can see myself as nothing more. It’s chaos though this life is drum, mostly. Staled and unsavory and nothing seems salvageable. Giving up eyes me like a seductive luxury, and I want to give in to a final sin, revealing to me the only fairness I’ll ever know in life. The mercy I can imbue into myself, the penetrative relief of the jailed soul broken loose of the physical. I want this. My own poorly utilized being has become as immaterial as everything else I’ve let go of. Fuck it."
depression,Is it possible for someone to develop PTSD from self harm? A family member has told me they used to self harm and I’ve been reading about PTSD and I think they have some of the symptoms. I’m wondering if the act of self harming is traumatic enough to send someone towards PTSD. Thanks.

depression,"I want to quit life I want to quit my life. I don't want to kill myself, no, I want to shut everything down, take my time, and restart.

Quit my job, break up my relationship, cancel my apartment, throw most of the things I have in the trash and start over completely, alone, on my own, only being responsible for myself.

My life is nuts. The past 8 or 10 years have been a roller coaster downhill. I want to get out. I took the wrong turn 10 years ago and was too stupid to fix it when it was still possible.

This whole thing is so unnerving I could randomly scream at people. All I want is to lay down on the couch and sleep for 3 months. And then I want to pick up my life again. Meet friends I haven't met in years. Play the games I bought 8 years ago and haven't played. Pick up writing instead of software development in that big ass annoying company with that tiny little prick of a boss. I don't want to work for the next 3 months at least.

I want to push the stop button on everything and enjoy the silence, and breathe. And then I want to push the play button again when ***I*** want to.

But I have no money to do so. I don't want to end up on the street.

I can't quit my job and stay with my girlfriend because we need the money.

I can't quit our apartment because both of us would end up on the street.

I can't break up with my girlfriend because I love her, she loves me, and don't want to hurt her.  I don't want any of that on my conscience. I can't lay on the couch and sleep for 3 months if I knew I destroyed everything. I couldn't write the book I wanted to write because it's about never giving up and how would I be supposed to write about that if I gave up?

I'm trapped in my own life and there's no way out. Others probably kill themselves, but I do like to live. There is so much I want to do, but I can't do it because my life prevents me from doing so. 

A tough one."
depression,"The thing speaks for itself. Res ipsa loquitur.

Last night, I couldn’t sleep. My brain wouldn’t shut up so I decided to listen to music to drown it out. Found a song that hit just like I was feeling. Guess the rest will just be lyrics but least it says more than I do. 

“Would anyone notice
If tonight I disappeared?
Would anyone chase me
And say the words that I need to hear?
That I'm no burden
Not so worthless
Bent so much that I just might break
All-consuming
So confusing
The questions that keep me awake
Would anyone care, would anyone cry
If I finally stepped off of this ledge tonight?
Would anything change, would you all be just fine?
'Cause I need a reason to not throw the fight
It just might save my life
Would anyone want me
If they knew what was inside my head?
Would anyone see me
For the person that I really am?
I won't lie
So hard to hide
I've never felt worthy of love
I would give up
Everything I have
Just to feel good enough
Would anyone care, would anyone cry
If I finally stepped off of this ledge tonight?
Would anything change, would you all be just fine?
'Cause I need a reason to not throw the fight
It just might save my life
If you're dying inside
Sick of being alive
Let me in, let me share in your pain
From my lungs through the dark
Spoken straight from the heart
Let me give you a reason to stay
If you're out there still lying awake
If you're out there still wondering
Would anyone care, would anyone cry
If you finally gave up and turned out the light?”"

I'm in the process of filing FMLA/short-term leave paperwork, for a mental health condition, which has continued to get worse. My employer itself handles the short term leave paperwork/claim, which pays at 100% for 8 weeks.

Should I put the start date of aliment as 2013 (I've struggled with mental health conditions for a long time), or closer to the present day? It has gotten worse, and I need time and space to deal with it head-on. Does it matter?

depression,"remembering old moments with friends all of a sudden and feeling heavily depressed because of it me and my two friends we used to hang out semi frequently and play games pretty much everyday together (this was probably until last year july), i was at a really bad place back then so they helped me a lot, not directly, just by their company. then slowly both of them got busy with school but it moreso they also lost interest. I'm homeschooled and they go to school together. i never went to school with them but if i could choose over going to school if it was with them i definitely would. I also moved so we don't meet as much. I didn't care about any of this as much until a few days and would just remember them as ""good times"" and didn't mind enjoying myself by my own company. but in these past few days those days just have been hitting me and iv'e constantly been looking over old messages and clips and just really wish i could go back. Like i've mentioned before i was at a bad place last year but the depression just slowly went away as i started focusing on other things and myself, or atleast it wasnt as bad as before. these past few days the old times feel like theyre coming back and this time i don't even have the company of my friends which was the only thing that helped me. yes i talk to them online occasionally and i do know other people, but its the same situation where neither of us really talks much, its just a once in a few months communication situation with them. Sorry for the long text. but i just wanted to know if i can get rid of these feelings and just move on like before and why they are appearing back all of a sudden. thanks for reading."
depression,"I’m a nurse. me, 21 (M) had been working since I was 15 paying my own tuition fees and bills. I just had been questioning life recently and what am I doing with it. I’m fucking 21 and I don’t have the simplest thing like a drivers license yet or have what younger people have at their age. I’ve been so hyper focused with paying bills my whole life that it just makes it seem like I’m a slave going through the same cycle over and over again for money and have nothing accomplished in my life. 

It is just becomes so depressing that the dark thoughts that I have are to take high alert medications from my patient’s like fentanyl/morphine syringe from the Baxter pumps and inject it into my veins so that I can finally not think of anything anymore and just to feel numb.

In the past I just kept myself busy, found fun things in life or dabbled in toxic, self destructive behaviour. Things have changed(personality wise for the better).

But due to my lack of structure in live, lack of energy and lack of self-worth this period has been extremely long for me personally.

How can people do it day after day?

I’m medicated and surrounded with people who love me, and I don’t even want to wake up in the morning…"
depression,"I’m shallow but because of this it somehow shifts my focus on depression elsewhere in particular to the way I look. I don’t think that I’m at the best place I’m supposed to be mentally and physically. About roughly 2 weeks ago I was in a very dark place and because I skipped my medication my depression got to a place where I could be walking around and then feeling like crying. I could cry at any moment and I find it hard to control myself. I think part of the reasons why I am behaving this way is because I have little control over my own life. I can go to places where I wanted to go within the boundaries given to me. But does give me freedom, I think it’s not enough to give meaning in life. 

As to why I don’t have a sense of direction or a clear goal in mind I think part of it is because I’ve been told what is expected from me from a very young age and I cannot fulfill those expectations. Because of this I tend to find comfort from things outside especially through eating (which I am trying to change), TV programs, reading novels and other form of entertainment such as music. I’m thankful that those things does not cost as much as expensive product that I used to buy because I thought that if I look a certain way then all my problems will be fixed. But that’s just not how the world works. Currently I am not at my best and the only things troubling me is that a lot of things that are about livelihood is out of my control and that I feel sad and hopeless. If I could compare myself to some other being I would see myself as a parasite or a burden. 

The mistakes I made I felt it’s late to change. But within this tough time I am able to focus on other things which could impact my health. For instance with the way I look right now it’s not the best that I can be because I’ve gained roughly 20 kg during before the pandemic and I am obese. And as I was thinking about ending everything and taking my own life I could not forget the fact that I am not in my prime. That I do not look the best that I possibly could. It’s the shallow part of me that’s talking and taking control. I don’t think that this is a good solution for anyone because if you focus on outer appearances in the long-run everyone ages and our bodies are not the same as we age. We decay and trying to hold onto this prime status closest to our ideals is impossible. 

But in this case I think because I focused on this rather than other parts about my depression is becoming voices in the background. Perhaps the medications I’m taking now is working. Even the psychiatrist told me that after two weeks of the medication and when we meet again on the next appointment. I might no longer want to lose weight, clearly that is not the case and I think that it’s not about peer pressure or anything but it’s about holding onto the past. When things were simpler back when I still had a chance to live  out the aspirations where I had meaning in life where I still dream for a better future or a brighter future. But now everything is gone and I can’t go back in time to fix anything. And even if I try to explain myself. Even if I did do something better I don’t think people forget that easily or maybe I’m a pessimistic person. I don’t know. I just think that life is not meaningful nor beautiful and perhaps that’s just my negativity talking but this is how I feel. And the only thing that I can focus on right now that’s the only positive thing is escapism or trying to look my best on the outside cause everything inside is a mess. My mind is a mess."
depression,"How to deal with all the thoughts of ""if only..."" I am having troubles both in my marriage and and work.  My wife and I are seeing a marriage therapist but I'm not sure how well it is working.  I know that I am the only person who can address my problems at work.  It is a lot of pressure because I am the sole breadwinner and we have children.

But at home, I feel like some of our marriage problems could be addressed ""IF ONLY"" my wife would blah blah blah.  She says she needs to address her own issues, which feels very much like blowing me off.

I know that I have the ultimate responsibility for my life.  But I feel like a marriage should be one person supporting the other and I don't feel that.

Not sure what else to say."
depression,"Ive been happy after a long time... Todays day was mostly about myself. I completed a kdrama. Also I drew today. I feel really good.

At the end of the other days from today, I will want to die in my sleep again."

depression,"I am feeling so depressed and low. I don't know what to do? I came to know yesterday through some of my friends from my 1st job, that the CEO/manager of that organization and his wife are dead. They died last week. I just can't believe that they're gone leaving behind their only child of 6 yr old. 

He was not like other managers. He was our friend and a great father figure. We loved his sense of humor. He always believed in giving people chances. He also took a chance on me when nobody would. His wife also used to come to visit us with their little boy. But some people can't outrun their weaknesses. His weakness was young and pretty girls. 

He had gotten emotionally-involved with the HR of his company. He and his wife fought a lot about that. He had to fire her because of this. But they continued his tryst until last week when his wife came to know about his still continuing tryst with the girl. 

His wife poured sanitizer on herself in the bathroom and set herself on fire. He tried to save her and sustained a lot of burn injuries. They both were admitted in different hospitals. His wife passed away before him. His health was improving but his burns got infected and he passed away due to septicemia. 

The saddest and tragic part of this whole incident, is his father and his stepfamily couldn't care less about him. They're only interested in the money earned from his business. I feel so sad and depressed right now. My blood sugar is really low and I feel so tired and weak. I just don't know how to deal or cope with this."
depression,"Inquiry Since my sibling is a therapist, and we had a long stemming unhealthy relationship, we are cool now. I just see them in a different light. I struggle to take them serious because i see her techniques in conversation. So i just slowly give it up, the two times i tried i feel immune to it. But idk i am quite sociopathic, narcissistic, charming and deceptive and most of the time, i've made up my mind long before talking about it although i do have many issues."
depression,"I wrote the letter yesterday I wrote the letter today, the one that explains why I'm killing myself, and I'm terrified.

For the last year (maybe 2 years even), I've been going in circles with my emotional state. I start off wanting to get better and looking for options - friends, therapy, dating, personal projects, events. Then, when the end of the month comes, I'm working towards the end again, like clockwork. Every start of this deranged clock is more bleak and every ending more intense. Since June, I've become less and less sure I'll make it till the end of the month. Friends are gone or are ambivalent, dating is a fruitless endeavor, therapy won't take my insurance (anywhere), and personal projects are hampered by everything else. I have a monthly bookclub I just joined, but I've so little confidence that anything will come of it.

I now I wrote the letter I've thought about for the past couple of months. I wrote it while at work, a whole fucking essay. I cried and had to shut my door because I didn't want to disturb anyone. I broke completely when I couldn't complete the note to my brother. I was a wreck for the rest of the day.

I think I'm back at the beginning of the clock, but I'm so scared. I finally have a therapy session at the very end of September, but I'm not sure if I'm going to make it, and I'm even more worried that if the session doesn't go well... I just don't know what to do! I'm alone and I'm never good enough for anything or anyone. Most my friends have abandoned me and have shown they don't care, that they're apathetic. I'm no one's best in anything, and there's no work or effort I do that seems to resolve any of this"
depression,How do people do live when it gets hard. My life was content but since I turned 18 it just went to crap like a lot.I guess I finally made it to the “real world” .Since then I started college I have been struggling academically making me feel stupid like I don’t even belong there in the first place.Some of my family members are severely sick. How do people keeps going? Especially the people that have it worse than me. I am ready to give up honestly I can’t imagine myself doing this for another 40+ years that seems like torture. I hope I get cancer or some terminal illness I don’t want to do this anymore.
depression,"I’m highly sentimental, but I’ve turned all of my life memories into sadness. Trauma brain wired to hold the bad? Anyone else have this problem? I have been a big documentary my whole life from photos to videos to writing. 

I’ve had so much loss, so many people who just left me or failed me or had to put distance away from me because of my mental health - which just enhances that loss. 

I’m at the lowest point in a 3 year period when I thought my lowest was with a major nervous break down 3 years ago. It just gets lowers… half way through a person came in and gave me home and helped build me up but dropped me hard and I lost it 

I can’t even be happy for that good period because it ended poorly. When things end poorly, I most typically blame myself, I have a personality disorder so frankly it almost always is my fault, so even good memories or photos burn when I see them because it just triggers the reminder: oh yeah, I loved them and those times and I ruined the whole friendship or love and then I was fucked up for a time and also a fucking piece of shit to them, and here I am still me still this negative energy in the world except I have a lifetime of pain and hurt instead of say 5 years, or 10, or 15…

Y’all, how can I bring back goodness from those times I so loved?"
depression,"medication help  

Hi, long story short, heres the antidepressants i've been on so far:

Citalopram purely because my mom is on it and it works well for her, I'd been on it 5-6 years, it helped my depression because i remember having a mental breakdown when i stopped taking it however the side effects were really getting to me. I had no libido at all, was putting on weight excessively and exhausted 24/7.

After that I was put onto escitalopram, then sertraline and they was exactly the same, they helped but couldn't stand the side effects.

After being referred to a physiatrist he put me onto amitriptyline which was the worst week of my life, i felt like i had vertigo, constant dizziness and sickness it was horrible.

Next was paroxetine which didn't help at all just made me exhausted.

Currently i'm on duloxetine which is making me have constant brain fog, i feel spaced out all the time like i'm not myself it's so strange, it's like i'm watching someone else live my life, and constantly exhausted with no motivation at all. My memory has become terrible, i can't remember what i did last week it's very scary.

My question is, is there anything out there that anyone can suggest next? i'm in the uk so Wellbutrin isn't an option unfortunately. The main things I need help regarding are my overthinking, no motivation/exhausted all the time even after sleeping 14 hours a night, lack of determination and sex drive. I'm at my wits end I don't know what else to do, everything just feels very pointless and mundane."
depression,"Hello. I know everyone is different when it comes to this. I will feel down every once In a while, but I haven't felt like this for 4-5 days in a row. Is there something small I could try and do to lift my spirits up?"
depression,"In the worst slump to date. I am hopeless I am a 30 y. o. woman. I work a full time job (I am a teacher) +  side jobs and the money is still not enough. I speak 3 foreign languages, I am friendly, I get people to open up to me. I still get financial help from my parents, so I can stay afloat. I live by myself, I have a car a car, I am fairly attractive.  I have a narcissistic mother who has always put me down and told me that no one will love me because there is something wrong with me. I was her child therapist, she was  jealous of my relationship with my dad, who eventually gave up and left to work in a different country. She  could never allow me to enjoy any success. (she told me I got a 100% on  my 1st important exam cause she's also a teacher and probably someone figured out i am her daughter, she promised me that she'd help me study in another country and 2 weeks before the confirmation she told me she can't - why the fuck didn't she tell me to not apply in the 1st place? she told me i was crazy for wanting to travel, to see the  world - that i am looking for it with my restlessness. 

I did everything right, I graduated, I studied, I was the proverbial good girl until I got my 1st job and my 1st boyfriend (20y older than me) at 23. Both of these experiences were a flop lol and my mother made sure to tell me what a failure I was, how no one will love me, how I will become homeless. I was depressed for 4 months. 5 years later, I am enjoying my current teaching job (been doing it for 5 years), I have a good social life, I've been on dates, I got HPV by sleeping with a loser - apparently everybody has it. Nonetheless, I AM ALWAYS ON EDGE. I am always on edge that I might fall back into that depression I felt back that when I felt so helpless. So I have this very  strict routine I stick to, I am afraid of changes, of bringing men into my life, of trying anything new.

This summer, due to this political/economical bullshit + resentment that I can't get over, the health anxiety, and never quite trusting myself, I fell into the worst slump of my life. I see no point to my life. I haven't done anything this entire summer, I feel like a failure, like the worst human that has ever existed. I am afraid of dying from cervical cancer, of becoming ugly and old, of losing weight, of never feeling good enough  in my skin, of never having full financial independence.

 All I do is sleep. I still take care of basic stuff like eat/brush my teeth, but I can't look at myself in the mirror. I am in therapy. I have this anger outbursts especially after I talk to my mother on the phone. I have started self harming. One night I threatened to end it all and she told me to do it if that is all that's left. My own  mother never cared about me when I wasn't at my best and  never will care enough to tell me to stop harming myself.  I want to ruin everything for myself, so I can prove her right, that I am indeed a failure. Every time she talks to  me she preaches to me, she has this angry voice, like she is talking to a child. 

This + some rejections have made me feel like I am indeed worthless and no one will want me.

I don't see the point to keep going. My father told me to live life for myself, but I feel like I have no  life. Financially, things will never change in my country, I am stuck in this routine, no one will ever love me and I will keep degrading. I doubt my every  decision. I feel guilty and the torturing myself/my mom is also a way  for me to self sabotage because the I regret it and I feel even worse. 

Has anyone ever  went through something similar. I know the tips, exercise,  eat healthy, wake up at the same  hour. I don't know what I need to hear... I just need some kind words or maybe some other ideas because my mother will obviously tell me to kill  myself if that is all that's left for me."

depression,"Healing. When will I be healed?

Healing doesn’t happen over night. You can’t chose who you fall in love with. Or out of love with for that matter. I don’t love him anymore, actually I hate him. I hate what he did to me. How he made me feel. How he still makes me feel. I lie to everyone and say I’m over it. But I’m not. Not even close. I can’t escape the horribleness I feel from everything he did to me. Even in my own head, he ruined a little piece of all of me. He broke me down. Made me change who I am. How I think. How I love. How I trust. It’s been years at this point. Part of me thinks thinks I will always be that 14 year old little girl that some boy took advantage of and broke. I flinch when I know I shouldn’t, over think when there is nothing to think about. Stay quiet when I know I should speak. I am a shell of who I used to be. I turn corners praying nothing on the other side trigger the thought of what he did. No one knows the true story. No one ever will. Just him, me, and my brain. They call me dramatic. “He would never do that” “He is such a good guy” has he hurt others like this? Or was I the unlucky one? Did he learn from our mistakes? Will I ever be me again? 

I am healing. One breath, one step, one moment at a time. 

Healing."
depression,"my friend makes me sick My mental health is garbage. My depression is only getting worse and worse and I need to fix things. One thing is my 'friend' g. I have feelings for g and have done for a while. I managed to move on but they tend to return. Before I fell for her she got into a relationship with someone who I distrust deeply and my limited interactions with him only fuel my distrust for him. I have discussed this with g before but the only change was their relationship getting deeper.

Cut to today and I've since fallen for g. Problem is that I can't obviously be with her. And hearing about her relationship does not make it easier. The more I think about it the sicker I feel. And I just can't help but get angry that the guy who sets off every alarm bell in my head is living the life I desperately want. She's talked about the activities they do together and I want to cry. She talks about having sex with him before and I genuinely contemplate suicide. I just need to cut her out of my life.

I've tried so many times to look past it but I just can't do it. And it's not like I had a chance anyway. I knew this was going to happen for literal years but I'm still upset over this"

I’m in therapy but have only had two sessions so far and had to cancel the one for yesterday because my mom wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t watch my kids. 

My relationship of 7 years is ending and it’s hard not to blame it on my depression. I know he definitely contributed to us falling apart but I can’t help blaming myself. I always fucking do. It’s awkward living here with him even though we haven’t officially ended things, I know it’s over and it’s for the best because that’s what I wanted but I still feel so bad. 

He told me I’ve been a bad girlfriend and that things have been falling onto him a lot and that’s why he’s been so rigid. He also told me he still thinks I’m a good person but also a fucked up person with a lot of issues. He told me a lot of things but before I gave up, I warned him that he was pushing me away with his behavior. He didn’t listen or take me seriously I guess and now it’s too late.

I’m exhausted trying to keep up with everyone else’s lives and asking them how they are. I don’t feel like talking to my friends anymore. All I want to do is hide in my bed and sleep. Chores are a daunting fucking task. I have so much shit I need to do. I literally don’t have time for this and I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. It feels like I’m going to be this way forever and I don’t have the fucking time to be depressed. I’m sick of this shit."

My life was over with before it really ever began. Growing up with a host of problems, sadness, and grief has been too much for me to handle. It is not like things have gotten better, things are honestly getting worse both in my interpersonal life and mentally. Mentally I have given up a couple of years ago, as before I had hopes and dreams and now I am a shell of the woman I could have become. I spend most of my day sleeping, at night I stay up crying. I currently can not work because of the school program I am in, and even towards my degree am I slowly losing hope. I just do not have the mental nor physical energy to put in to a life where I know that I wont get much out of.

depression,"After 10 years, I'm still the same sad, empty, man-child I was back then. I'm worn out. I'm often accused of being too negative, but I sincerely believe that what others are seeing is optimism met with constant disappointment. I think I convinced myself year after year that things would turn the corner and get better, that my life would stop feeling like it was headed toward nothing. But it's been well over a decade and it's still unbearable. As a matter of fact, it seems to be getting worse.

2009: ""Once I finish high school, the new opportunities at college will turn my life around"".

2011: Mother dies abruptly. ""I just need to get off this damn campus and start my true adult life and I'll be able to pursue what I want in life""

2014: Rejected from every medical school I applied to. Taught high school. ""If I can just make it through this next application process, I can start working on my career and that'll make me happy""

2017: Almost failing out of medical school. ""I've just got to make it through this and once I can start my career, it will fill the void I'm feeling""

2020: ""Just gotta make it through 3 more years and then I'll have big boy paychecks and the money/financial security will take the anxiety away and I will be able to feel something""

2022: Turn 30. Am still miserable, unfulfilled, and alone. I spend every spare minute working so I don't have to think about my life. I avoid my family because I feel like they deserve better. I feel like I have missed all of the major adult milestones. Hell, I'm barely functional outside of the office. I dread finishing residency because I won't have anything to work toward anymore.

I feel like I'm done trying. I promised myself that I would stick around until 8/20/32, an arbitrary date I decided on a couple years ago because it gave me some comfort to know that there was going to be an end. But over the last few years, I've been finding it harder and harder to wait. I don't know that I can tolerate another decade.

I'm a massive hypocrite. As a physician, I talk to people on a daily basis about suicide and that there are alternatives and things that we can try to help them out. But I also can't shake the feeling that I'm less important than literally every other person on the planet. I don't matter and while my loss would make a slight rattle, people will forget. People will forget and I will never cross their minds again. I cease to exist. Maybe I belong in the ether. I am a waste of space and resources.

I'm ranting, I guess. But I don't think I want to be here anymore."

depression,"How do I recover from a mental breakdown/distress? I’ve (F23) had a lot of stress in my life lately and it’s built up (some stuff has been building over the last couple years). This week, I’m still recovering from a mystery infection, which developed right after I had COVID. I’m also on my period. So my body is quite stressed itself, and the mental stress added, landed me in a pickle today when I just felt totally freaked out. And alone. Anyways, I’m now nervous about the impact the breakdown of sorts had on me, mentally and physically, which is making me more nervous. 

TL/DR: I just want to heal, but can’t find tangible advice. What can I do to soothe my nervous system, get healthy, and reset?

PS: I’m already trying to cover the basics (eating well, sleeping, movement) but it is hard right now, advice on how to get back in the groove would be helpful! I am also already going to therapy.

depression,"how do i live a better life **I'm in my early teens, and I repeatedly punch myself whenever i self deprecate or upset.**

Just this year i decided to consult my school counsellor, but he wasn't very helpful and my situation remained unchanged. (probably because i couldn't be honest around him)

When I was a lot younger, like 8 or 9, I was actually very outgoing and somewhat extroverted. Until I was vehemently bullied during elementary school, the teachers (as usual) did nothing to help me and just stared at me, or they would just punish me instead of the bully.

Since then, I could barely talk to anyone at all, even my teachers, and past friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest problem stems from school because I hold this belief (since the start of the school year) that everyone hates me, and I should just transfer to another school (which would probably repeat the same cycle lmao)

It's annoying and makes me feel like shit at the same time, it affects my performance at school, hobbies, and my personal life. In addition, I'm afraid to the point that I can't leave my house and have to depend on others for my daily necessities, like food.

Even though they have not done anything to harm me, (like verbal or physical abuse) I still find my subconscious telling me that nearly everyday. It triggers whenever I get stared at in class or in public.

* As a result, I don't have any 'real' friends like my classmates at school or siblings do. And even if my classmates do try to talk to me and be friends, they would eventually invite me to hang out with them. (which i will just reject out of fear which makes me even more distanced from them)

I brought this up to my mother and they don't seem to be supportive of it, tormenting me for a week because of it."

I no longer have any friends my own age. I really don't have any friends outside my family nowadays. So I don't really talk to many people about what's bothering me. Everything is getting so expensive, and it's hard to keep up. I feel like I'm trapped with no social mobility coming my way. Wages are low, and I feel as if I'm in a dead-end position on various fronts.

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting a lot more money at one time. Then my brother died of an overdose and I really hit a spiral. I stopped caring about work and soon found myself unemployed. Although I was able to get another job, the pay isn't nearly as high. I didn't seek out therapy after my brother died in 2018. I didn't do that when my mom died either when I was 9.

&amp;#x200B;

And this year, I turned 30. It's not where I thought I'd be at this age. What do you think I should do?"
depression,I just need someone to listen to my story… This post got deleted when I posted yesterday.I just need someone to listen to my story ..I need to get this off my chest…
depression,"Excessive Sleeping I literally slept for more than I can count but im still tired and still in need of sleep. Slept 27hrs straight, woke up just for about 30mins then went to sleep again. This time I slept for around 16-17hrs, woke up and stayed for an hour and slept again for 13hrs. Is there something wrong with me? Im still tired and sleepy, I think im gonna take a nap again soon, rather sleep for many many hrs"
depression,"old messages I read my boyfriend's messages with her ex. This situation bothered me. It gets me down, I can't get their talk out of my mind. I feel jealousy, resentment."
depression,"Finding no reason to live. I thought I was feeling better after having a confrontation with my family about my depression but lately I've been feeling low and really demotivated to do anything. I don't see any reason why I'm here. So I'm 28/f and my family wants me to start a family and get a kid. But I don't want one and I don't see any plan of having one in the future. I don't have a job and don't want one, so I've been doing business in baking and getting orders from my usual customers. And there are days that I don't even wanna do that too. I don't know what to do. I'm just stuck."
depression,"Spouse doesn't get it My spouse lashed out at me yesterday. It's been on my mind and I honestly feel kinda pathetic for letting it still get to me today. But it makes me feel like it truly would be for the best if I was just gone. Like I'm a burden. Not trying hard enough.

They're frustrated I'm not better after switching to a new antidepressant. As if they're supposed to magically cure all my ills in a week and are some kind of happy pills.

They told me they don't understand why I can't just do better, like they've had to do when they had to deal with hard times in life. Why I don't just push myself and how I can be okay with myself. They asked how I'm able to stand living with myself like this. At one point they said ""Are you really that far gone in the head?"" in a disgusted way, with a disgusted look on their face. It really, really fucking stung.

Then later they apologized. They said they only lash out because they don't know how to help me. That it makes them angry to see me feel so bad, and they took that anger out on me. But then they went on to say they just can't understand how I don't *want* to do better, or how I don't *want* to spend my time on things that are actually productive. How I could possibly ""be okay with living like this.""

It's not that I don't want to do better. It's not that I don't want to spend my time doing things I enjoy. I just can't. I can barely get myself to shower every day. I get zero joy out of things that used to be my solace, that used to be my hobbies, that used to make me want to live.

I can't do art anymore. I pick up a pencil and paper and I stare. And the deep sense of apathy and depression consumes me. I can't get anything down. I can't write for recreation anymore. Only a sentence and thats if I can even bring myself to bother. My brain sees no reason to live, I get no feelings of joy. It's physically impossible for me to feel happy or accomplished for doing something.

I'm such a fucking burden and it's obvious every single time my partner tells me I'm hopeless. Every single time they lash out at me. Then they say I can confide in them, but when I do? They get sad and say I'm bringing their mood down. That it's too depressing to be around me.

Sometimes I'm just quiet. Down. Unable to really get out of bed. And they get upset and vent about how I'm just making them feel bad and how I need to cheer up and stop being so depressing. When I just can't cheer up, and tell them I'm struggling with my depression at the moment, they get angry and just abandon me. Then get upset if I don't chase after them.

Idk. I know it's unhealthy but otherwise they're someone I genuinely love and care about. They've helped me out a lot before, but now they're just done. They say it's hard to watch someone you love just waste their life away.

I feel like it'd be better if I just died. I'm always a burden on the people I love and it fucking hurts. I don't know if I'll ever get better. I've gone through so many different medications and none of it seems to work. I feel like at this point there's nobody but myself to blame for the medication not helping. For the therapy not working. I'm feeling like I'm truly a lost fucking cause.

It's hard to find any reasons to keep going. Honestly it seems like literally everyone is tired of me. Is tired of me never getting better, of medications not working. At this point my life is a literal hinderance.

Everything feels cold. I feel like a failure. I don't know what else to do. I wish I'd never opened up, and I wish I'd never reached out, and I wish I'd never formed any friendships or relationships of any kind. I don't deserve them.

I don't know what to do anymore. How the hell am I supposed to live like this?"
depression,"Ive been so miserable I went through so damn much in middle school and high school. Especially high school. So much heartbreak and stress and dealing with fake people left and right. And i was so damn insecure. And looking back i really shouldnt have been. I used to get so much attention that i would just put to the side. Probably because of how insecure i was and how much i was stuck on someone. Idek how to put into words the stuff ive been through but it was hell. Then after high school. I start to have scalp issues and hair loss. And oh man there isnt much awareness to this but it isnt talked about how damn near impossible is to cure scalp issues for a lot of people. Even when going to multiple dermatologists. I graduated in 2020 and the scalp issues and hair loss havent gone away to this day. Back to how i was so insecure back in high school, one of my most favorite things about me was my curly hair. Now imagine how much more insecure i feel now.. and my scalp is always so damn itchy. I also fell in love with someone so strong in the past year and she left me. I miss her so much. So so damn much. I havent been wanting to look for a job again because of my stupid scalp. My life is so hell. I wish i coulc experience my life so much better cause i have a home and food and clothes all that but i cant fully embrace life when i feel so miserable. Im grateful to my mom for always taking care of me. But i wish i could get out there and get shit done. But this scalp issue is so much for me. Ive been suicidal cause of it but i dont want to be:/ i want to not want to die. Theres so much things that make happy but i cant be fully happy. I hate my life so much"
depression,"All that time that passed is giving me Anxiety I'm in a depressive rot again. Aside from going to work, all I do is watch movies and TV series. The same ones I used to enjoy, and I have them on repeat (I just cycle through them over and over). I do watch new ones when I have the energy for them. But usually, I want to watch stuff I've already seen.

So I was searching the internet for movies to download and trying to remember the titles. And as I scan the lists or recommendations I find, my eyes catch the title of a movie I liked, and my mind immediately scans my memories for the time and place I watched it. And then, after a brief moment of remembering the feeling of satisfaction or joy that movie gave me, my brain now focuses on how much time has passed since then and what I have been doing or what I haven't achieved. And then I became anxious because I realized I had nothing to show for that amount of time that passed. 

My train of thought would be like this:

Oh, that movie is good.

I think I saw it when I was in college.

Oh, it was released in 2013.

(having a flashback of what, when, where, and what I felt back then, my mental state, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

and then instantly compares it to where I am now

and then compares it to where I wanted to be in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

and then trying to remember exact memories of what happened in between

and panicking because I can't remember anything significant. but of course, I can remember details like the fact that I graduated, I started working ... places I've been ... people I've met .. but they're not things worth reminiscing about. I can't remember moments.

It's not the same as my memories before my depression, which were clear memories with so much depth as to what I was feeling, why it's an important memory, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I try to remember significant memories from the year my depression started (I think) to now...I'm coming up blank. empty, numb. 

&amp;#x200B;

and it's giving me anxiety, like ...

oh no, oh no, I have to start now, I have to change now, I have to act now. 

but unable to do anything.

just like the panic of remembering you have a deadline approaching but haven't even started yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what they say depression does to memory or it's just me?"
depression,"How to convince the partner! My spouse is depressed (my opinion) for as long as I know her. It took me few years to recognise that it might be depression and another few year to convince that it might be depression and that we should visit a psychiatrist.

depression,"I’m breaking down right now and I want to hurt myself I don’t know, I’m really tempted to cut myself because I heard it relieved stress and I want the easy way. Everything always fucking happens to me, I have no fucking friends because the closest ones I have left me and both my parents are selfish pricks who only fucking care for themselves. I just want to be happy and know what it’s like to wake up actually wanting to continue going and enjoy the day, I don’t care what it takes, I just wanna be happy. I hate my family, I hate my country and this planet and everyone. No one cares about what I feel. The only other friend I have is ignoring me over god knows what, because god forbid I have a fucking break. I want to kill and hurt myself but I’m too scared of a damn water slide so how am I gonna willingly hurt myself. I’m such a coward, I’m ugly, I’m useless, I’m a burden and a prick to everybody else and I just wanna die"

depression,"Who are the crazy ones: my parents or I? I’m 27 almost 28 year old male &amp; for as long as I can remember I never really had the best relationship with my parents. Don’t get me wrong I don’t hate them or anything like that I just feel like it was never as healthy as it should of been. I would describe them as authoritarian they were pretty strict with me growing up &amp; often beat me when I did something  which in turn caused me to resent them. We were never close in the sense that I would tell them about things or what was going on in my life, as I matter of fact a lot of things I hid from them &amp; more often then not I always found myself lying to them. I feel like though I could of put up with that, the real real reason I resent my father is because he owned a business &amp; would often force me to work with him where for many years he would berate me in front of everyone if I didn’t do what he said &amp; would beat me for something I did wrong. My parents would always say that I was too sensitive, I’m just a kid so I had no idea what I was talking about &amp; that I should deal with it because they’ve gone through worse &amp; that because they’re older than they have more life experience so my feelings didn’t really count. They say they love me &amp; I have no doubt they do but they’re always saying how their good parents &amp; talking about the sacrifices they made to raise us. My father once told me “fuck you” to my face &amp; my mom supported him saying I deserved it because I piss people off. So many times I wanted to break down &amp; cry. I once told my mom she was gonna make me cry &amp; she responded with anger. I’ll admit I do have anger issues which likely stem from my upbringing but they are always saying how i should talk to someone because of this anger I have, basically that there is something wrong with me. If I can make one more example last year at 26 some relatives came to visit &amp; working night shift I was very tired so my face was groggy when I said hi to them. My mom got so angry she refused to speak to me for a month. 
Let’s forward to today, I’m now almost 28 &amp; I live on my own. The quality of my life has greatly improved since moving out, I also work a evening shift job, which I’m in no rush to go to morning shift because it means having to interact with my parents less. I’ve never once invited my parents over my house &amp; I probably won’t in the foreseeable future. I can accept that my parents are loving &amp; they want the best for me but in their own way. I just want to know who is really in the wrong here? Is it my for being this way where I despise them &amp; want to interact with them as least as I can or them for their behaviour towards me growing up. Because if it is me I will happily admit it. Does this not seem like narcissistic behaviour to you, if not narcissism then what is it? 
Sorry for all the questions! Also if it helps I have 2 younger brothers who are starting to show the same issues I have but arguably I have them the worst being the oldest"
depression,"Please eat well. I think I accidentally ruined my whole day by eating some high fat food. No, I don't have an eating disorder, but I started crying for no reason and wondered if it was the meal I had.

depression,"i've ironically convinced myself that i deserve to live so things haven't been great lately. and i've been doing a lot of thinking i guess. as much as i wanna die all the time, as much as i just wanna leave and erase myself from existence, i feel like i don't deserve that. i hate myself so much that i actually think i deserve to live. it's torture to even wake up or get out of bed, so why should \_i\_ get release?

it's...all very confusing. to want nothing more than to just stop existing. but to also believe you don't deserve that kinda peace."
depression,"working through things, possibly helpful. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for about three weeks to help me work through my anxiety issues. I'm still struggling with depression and it's been really fucking hard. Today is going to suck. Balls. Just for anyone else out there with anxiety and depression issues, when you do find a good therapist, it's really eye opening. Obviously nothing will be resolved overnight, another big hump to overcome. I guess I'm just doing a little rant, because I don't want to feel alone in this, and I want other people to know that they aren't alone either"
depression,"I've regressed back into the worse me again I am a toxic motherfucker and I see everything I've built up the past few months picking myself back up again disappear before my eyes. Everything I've worked towards, every toxic habbit I have been learning to unlearn, the progress in my mental health, actually finding something good about life again- Gone.

I hate this. I hate that I am circling back into myself. I tried. I was trying so hard to be better. And I was, for a moment. Now I'm back to being my toxic self again hurting people I love and hurting anybody else around me in the process, and god.

What even is the point anymore.

I can't get help, I have no financial means to. I have been dragging my friends and family down for the past few days as I have been an irresponsive mess so I can't make myself reach out to them again. And now I have reverted back to being me again, that horrible horrible version of me. The one who keeps spiralling into SH and self destruction just cause that's all I have left now. That's all I can control at this point.

I'm drowning.

I can't do this anymore."
depression,"my depression is ruining my relationship I'm struggling, trying yo seek help is difficult when there's little support and mo understanding.
I came on my period too. So my serotonin has dropped completely.
My gf doesn't understand no matter how many times I'm vocal or tell her I'm struggling.
I need support. My depression always has question.
Why are you depressed.
Why do you hate me
Why are you being like that 
Wheres my gf gone

I'm honestly at a point where I don't wanna live and ruin anybody else's lives.
I can't talk to my parents either. They just always seem to think depression goes away. It doesn't."
depression,"I’m out of money, patience, time and ambition. I just feel stuck all the time. I’m sad, trying to apply and not getting jobs that pay more than $10 an hour. Living in a city which makes everything expensive. I put my eggs in a few baskets and with the exception of one day my life has been nothing but borrowing money from family and just wasting away.

I don’t know what to do. I need money. I have a college degree, worked almost my entire life but needed to get away from my abusive dad so left my hometown and never want to go back. I need a job that I semi enjoy, pays enough to where I can afford rent, food and gas and that’s it. I don’t think I’m asking for too much. 

I’m 32. I’ve paid my dues. My attitude has changed significantly from when I was younger. I feel I’m owed what I worked for. I was abused for years. It’s fine it’s whatever. I don’t think that entitles me to special treatment. I just want a job to afford bills.

If it doesn’t happen in the next 6 months when my lease is up I’ll have to move back to my hometown and inevitably work for my dad again.

I’m tired and upset and my depression and anxiety doesn’t make it any easier. I hate door dash the only job I like is working on set. I’ve met people and keep trying to make contacts. Everything is not fair sometimes and I just want to die"
depression,I just want to disappear I don’t want to be around. I don’t want to exist. I want to be no one. I hate myself. I have no friends. I want to wake up from this bad dream. I did this to myself. I want to sleep. I love my family and I wish I could find them in death but I can’t stay here.
depression,"I just want to pause life Do you ever just want to hit the pause button on life. 

I’m a 20yo female with long-standing history of mental illness and pituitary macro-adenoma (benign but causes depression in most patients). I’m trying to find my way in this world and started a course in automotive mechanics at the start of this year. It’s something i’m (or was?) passionate in but of course i’m late to the game and don’t know too much in the practical sense and am really struggling to gain the confidence to find or start an apprenticeship. 

It used to be something I looked forward too as I was too busy to listen to the ever nagging depressive thoughts but recently not even working can shoo them away. 

I’ve thought about trying to find another job but at this point I can’t be bothered. I don’t see the point in creating a future I don’t even want to be in. Everyday I wake up and attend my commitments and spend the rest of my waking hours exhausted mentally until I can force myself to sleep with medications. 

From the moment I wake up i’m plagued by thoughts of wanting to end my life. of course I would never go through with it as I have friends and family that love me and suicide doesn’t end my pain it will just transfer it to my loved ones, but i’m just fed up. 

I’ve been around this block before having been in hospital up to 6 weeks and having hundreds of hours of various types of therapy under my belt but I just can’t be bothered with it anymore. It feels like a full time job convincing myself it’s worth waking up tomorrow. 

I’m not too sure what I expect in posting this but if anyone has any words of advice and feels they relate or have had a similar experience and words will be appreciated. 

To end this post, I assure you i’m in safe environment and have a safety plan will not hesitate to seek medical attention if I feel it’s needed ❤️"

depression,"Being backstabbed has changed me Yep the title says it all ok so how this even happened was 3 years ago I was going though a hard time because my cat had passed away and I met an online friend who I would consider helped me feel something (emotions) however my friend was telling me their problems 24/7 I didn't mean it because it distracted me from the loss of my cat however this has been going on for a couple of months during that time and I started to actually feel overwhelmed worrying about my friend 24/7 because no matter what I did or said to them things always end up worse for them and to make matters worse my mental health started to kick in and I felt tired of the drama so I finally opened up to my friend about it saying that I needed space and wanted to be left alone (I know selfish but I was so stressed out from their drama) and my friend even tho they just said ""ok"" they left a very negative status about me which caused me to feel hurt and then when I finally got back from taking a break from the internet I had learned that they talked behind my back from my friend they admitted doing it and thats the very first time someone has ever done this to me I felt angry upset sad all negative emotions and then I decided to tell them that I couldn't do this anymore so I cut ties with them then a couple days later I felt guilty for being selfish and cutting ties with them so I messaged them again they were a bit petty towards me (understandable) and we kinda became friends again (I say kinda because the trust was gone) and then the same old things happened again a second time my friend in endless drama I tried my best to not let it bother me but all that negativity always gets to me and then during this time my friend kept talking about sensitive topics that I find sensitive and (they knew I was sensitive of it) all the time and I finally had enough and cut ties with them a second time and like the first time I felt guilty for cutting ties with them so I messaged them a second time they weren't as petty like the first time but felt upset at me for cutting ties again however our friendship was a bit distance we weren't as close as before and my friend was always talking to their other friends more often at first I upset about this then I realized that I wasn't really enjoying myself anymore like I used to anymore so I decided to ghost them since they were kinda ghosting me and I felt free but I noticed a few things that I do when I play games and someone backstabs me in a game I take it so personally that I feel like I can't breath and the same emotions I felt when my friend backstabbed me and to make matters even worse I started to ghost my other friends too I even unfriended most of my friends (not my friend that backstabbed me tho) and I don't see myself finding love anytime soon either because I feel like I don't deserve it and I don't want to feel the same pain I felt before I even started to develop in hating myself as well and I have a downward spiral of anger coming and going every once in awhile when something happens to me and I only really told my mom this but it still doesn't really make the pain go away and I don't want her to feel overwhelmed 24/7 because of me also I'd like to add me and my friend aren't in bad terms anymore we seem good for now tho we rarely talk due to us not really chatting about anything its just small talk most of the time anyway sorry if this was long I never really told anyone this (besides my mom)"

But I’m not allowed to call for help or leave his home. He makes me stay, play cards, and listen to his rap. For the record he used to hit my mom when she was pregnant with me. I tried to forgive him and look past it, but this man (biological dad) is telling me that snitches get stitches. And that his older self (when he was highschool) needs to be buried. He said that, not me. Would you want to see this person again after trapping you? I’m ready to cut my dad out of my life for good. He just a bully who gets away with everything because he still lives with his mom. I used to joke with him that my friends (which were freshman at the time) could beat him up. Dad would always get mad and I found it hilarious because he’s supposed to be grown. Maybe he gets off on hitting on little boys. Huh gayyy. Oh yeah and he’s a Christian??

When I was a teen, I had a bedtime “ritual.” In bed, I would often imagine scenarios where I would fall in love with imaginary people who would treat me badly, and that these people eventually would only realize how much I meant to them when I leave them, disappear (move to a different place), or die.

When I would go to bed after having fights with my parents, I would imagine me dying and that my parents would only realize that they shouldn’t have said or done what they did to me after my death. 

These thoughts would often bring me to tears and I would cry myself to sleep.

I found these thoughts, and crying, to be very comforting to the point that I often looked forward to bedtime. I can’t remember how or when these thoughts stopped.

Did any of you do this? Is this normal at all?"
depression,"How did you guys beat depression? I've been seeing a therapist for the past 2 years, switched recently. My current therapist thinks I've been spiraling downwards and states that I'm suffering from depression. 
I have frequent mood shifts (not in the good direction), have frequent if not constant feelings of anxiety and guilt. I am uncontrollably ruminating about my past and future, can't seem to focus on the present. I've not slept well for ages, am now underweight because I don't feel hunger anymore and can't force myself to eat. I've moved away from most of my friends, irremediably I think, and broke up recently because I'm don't feel functional enough to sustain a relationship right now. Nothings has felt satisfying for ages, and am feeling lonely now.

I'm really willing to get out of this mess, I've seen too many people struggle with depression around me, I do not wish to spiral further. I need to find enough mood &amp; energy to get rid of some stressors in my life, and progressively regain functionality. But for the love of God, this feels like a balancing act, it is overwhelming at times. How did you guys manage to get out of this hellhole? I think it would feel nice to hear some genuine messages of hope, and precious advice."
depression,"How long do I need to keep pretending? Everyday is the same thing all over ever since I was a kid. I was a bright kid but society is very condemning and abusive. During my childhood got bullied, judged, and abused by the people around me just because I tried to be myself. In highschool I tried to avoid the same mistake by pretending not to be myself. It's like wearing a mask just to survive in a society that's trying to reject you. Even though I survived by living like this, it was a painful experience and everything felt fake. Why do I need to torture myself just to live in a society? Because I am scared to be alone, to experience all the painful stuff as an outcast. Some people will say that I was lucky to survive until now but is it worth sacrificing your happiness just to live within a society that condemns you?"
depression,"Worsening situation I’ve been struggling with depression my entire life m37. The last year I was so tired of constantly being out of funds, so I made an immensely stupid decision an mad several loans from different creditors. And now I have to pay the piper. This situation is made worse by health complications and my doctor wanting me off my pain meds to take new meds for obesity, but those have opioid antagonist’s in them, meaning pain killer won’t work, and I am in debilitating pain, mostly head related, but also with joint pains, witch runs in my family. The reason for the new medication is that my blood pressure is insane, doctor almost admitted me to hospital. 
I just don’t know what to do. I want to die. But I don’t want my family to go through a suicide. I’ve made every plan for a potential death. Down to the music I want to listen to as I drift off, letters etc. I won’t share methods, as I don’t want to give anyone any ideas. But I’ve found a painless way, where all my organs can be donated, and that I will be found by the police, as to not burden anyone who is not trained.

For now, I chose to fight. And if you are in a similar situation, I hope you choose to fight too. I just needed to get this of my chest somehow. Wish you all the best."
depression,"My girlfriend wants to commit suicide and so do I. But i think she committed last night. My girlfriend and I have been together for about five months and we are long distance.  We met on an app (which i don’t encourage for safety reasons) but we’ve been going strong and we facetime nearly everyday. Neither of us are catfishing and we are both extremely in love. We’ve both bonded over our terrible family conditions and our depression. I’m aware that two depressed and suicidal people in a relationship is not healthy but i’m so in love with her and I don’t ever wanna leave her. Theres been times where she’s told me she’s close to  committing and i’ve done the same. Difference between her and I is that, i usually don’t leave her out of the loop for more than an hour. Last night i checked up on her and she told me she was “coping” and i knew what that meant immediately. Also yesterday she was going through a lot but i couldn’t give as much support because i was in walmart and my phone was about to die. The last time something like this happened was maybe two or three months ago. And she told me she was close to committing and i cried my eyes out for hours. Luckily she didn’t and her mom found her and she couldn’t get the chance. But she gets bullied at school and at home by her own mother. She’s completely backed into a corner and i can’t do anything at all. Last night i tried to keep getting her talking, asking her questions so i can get a better understanding. And not giving any advice because that doesn’t help, she’s not going to take it, and she doesn’t like it when u try to give her advice. She’s been dealing with this family and school situation for years not to mention she’s extremely insecure. That literally means Theres no safe space for her anywhere, not even alone. Only time i’m sure she’s beyond happy is when we’re talking on the phone. And it’s even more difficult because I just moved to Florida, we were once 1 hour away now we’re 18 hours away. She had called me last night and i felt so realized cause i thought for the most part that meant she’s still alive. But then her phone died. I don’t know if she’s alive. Cause i was texting her last night before it died (we were on the phone but not talking) and she never responded. so now i’m not sure if she fell asleep or if she’s dead. I’m not that holy but i am praying that she’s ok and she’s alive. It’s quite early in the morning and we went to to bed late last night so i probably have to wait a couple hours to hear anything from her if she’s alive. But i’m dreading to get that text for her friends saying she’s dead. I desperately need help."
depression,"Single 3 Years and Just Moved to New Country Summarized version:

(idk if really “NSFW” but marked just in case)

Spent the 1st half of my 20s (I’m a cis-man) in a relationship that became extremely toxic and ended with my fiancé cheating on me. She was also the person that took my virginity.

Spent the next 6 months living with her still because of our shared lease. 

Had less than 4 months between moving out of our apartment and the start of COVID lockdowns to sort of try dating and figure who I was being single in my mid 20s. 

Didn’t actually manage to go on any real dates. Took a trip to Europe a month before lockdowns and after failing to have any ONS or vacation fling, reluctantly went to a brothel (I was in a country where it’s legal and regulated) because I didn’t want my ex to be the only and last person I had sex with. 

Didn’t bother dating during covid because I lived with 4 other people (1 immunocompromised) and was planning on moving to a new country for school ASAP. Of course, I had no idea how long that would be.

Almost two years after lockdowns finally moved to said country. 

At this point I’m mid/late 20s and now at a school with people mostly in the 18-21 range (with a few early-mid 20s as well). While I got some female attention I’m very reluctant about dating people that much younger than me due to the power imbalance and maturity difference that typically exists. 

To oversimplify, I developed a crush on one girl in my class. She turned me down but somehow we still became fairly close emotionally and at times it seemed like she was expressing interest (which several other students noted). I told her it seemed that way and she said i was misreading things and that it was still all platonic. Once again though, we became even closer and I told her that while I tried to, I couldn’t see her as platonic and that my feelings just got stronger when we spent time together. 

She ultimately suggested we should just stop talking, which is why I was scared to tell her how I felt in the first place (instead of staying silent, even if it hurt). I basically felt like i was choosing heartbreak with a friend or a different heartbreak without one. I’ve been here 6 months and she’s the *only* close friend I have here, my other friends are out of town or visiting their home countries, and I’m worried I made the wrong choice. *I’ve never felt so alone in my life since that conversation ended.*

I’ve tried tinder, i’ve tried bumble, but only got a small number of matches, and even less who actually responded. I can confidently say I’m attractive by traditional standards, but I have way more relationship experience than dating experience. I haven’t had sex in over two years (since the brothel) and while I could probably have a ONS if I really tried, I know I would just feel empty after. I haven’t felt the warmth or intimacy of someone next to me in years, and it’s killing me. Not just sexually but emotionally. This was the closest I’ve felt to that in the 3 years I’ve been single and I’m tired of waiting. I know my ex has moved on (courtesy of Facebook memories), and even the girl I mentioned has told me about a few casual encounters she’s had since she and her ex broke up (including within a week of it). I’m not slut shaming her, just expressing frustration with where i’m at by comparison. 

I know the rules say I should be asking for advice but I don’t know what to ask. Obviously I’m going to keep trying to go out and meet people but I’m so miserable of being both single and alone for so long. I’m *not* suicidal but I don’t even feel like trying to go out right now. While I’m in a decent sized city the central part of town is pretty small and there’s a modest chance of me running into her (it’s happened a couple times before). 

Like, I know what I need to do. I’ve tried. It just hasn’t worked. And while I thankfully wasn’t affected as hard financially by covid, it really fucked with my mind spending two years of replaying my breakup with my fiancé instead of spending that time dating and figuring things out. 

I don’t get attached to people that often, and if it only happens this rarely I’m terrified of what I still have to go through before finding someone i truly click with. 

If you even just read this far, thanks."

depression,"I hate the just for laughs festival (warning: suicide) I hate the just for laughs festival and I'm going tell why: I made an animated TV show idea for the just for laughs festival named Victor and friends, it's about the mascot of the festival Victor, I have spent years making this project happen and I tried contacting the people at the just for laughs group, I did found somebody and so I pitch my TV show but they rejected it witch made me really depressed since I wasted many years on this project, hell I even made concept art for it but that person left the just for laughs group and then they replace that person and so I think to myself ""hmm I can probably try to pitch to them again"" and so I did, they didn't respond and I was upset that they didn't respond, I thought they just ignore me, I ask my mom what's should do about this, she told me to email them a bunch of times so they'll think that I'm professional and so I did, I only email them like 2 or 3 times or something and then I waited for months and months until they respond and they did respond but it was from their chief legal officer, she told me to stop contacting them and if I tried to pitch to them again they will sue me, this made me even more depressed and angry, I wanted to kill myself just because of their respond, I have spent half my life on this project and now it's all gone, you may think that this is stupid or I'm being over reacting about this but I'm dead serious about killing myself, it has changed me into a more angry, hateful, powerful man now and I got even more mad when they went into a massive rebranding, it got rid of what made just for laughs festival and now every time I see a advertising promoting the just for laughs festival it just makes me have a bad mood. And that's why I hate the just for laughs festival, you maybe be thinking that this hole thing is stupid and I'm just being a little baby for not getting his TV show but I understand what you are thinking of me now when I confess this, I have ODD and it makes me not accept the word ""no"" but I understand that's not going to get me what I want, I still have suicidal thoughts to this very day."
depression,"I have no motivation to do anything. I just don’t have any motivation to do anything anymore. Every day feels like the same on repeat. I’ve lost my will to try new things, go out and meet people, etc. I still manage to do my work from home job and go to the gym for an hour or 2 about 3-4 days a week, but besides that I just can’t do anything else. I see people walking by outside, happy and enjoying life and I just don’t know how they do it. I don’t know what there is to be happy about. Some days, when it’s really bad, I only have the ability to stay in bed and watch movies, sleep, and read. When people ask me to hang out or reach out to make plans I don’t even have the energy to reply let alone see them. Im tired but I don’t do much. I also just want to be alone. In quite and peace where no one will judge me for just being a lazy piece of shit all day long. I’m already on medication for depression and anxiety and I can’t afford a therapist or psychiatrist right now so please don’t suggest that. I think I’m in a slump but I don’t know how to get out.

depression,"Another day..Another year Just turned 29 a few days ago and surprised I'm still here. Too many times I've tried to convince myself  things can always get better or go a different way. 

Living with bpd makes you not want to do just that..be living...

Feeling empowered  to ghen be robbed of your being, tears the fabrics of  what makes you whole. 

All the efforts of persistence, determination, etc always back to failure,shame,,worthlessness...the moments of escape,the days, the weeks..the ones that are good...they never last...your always playing catch up with your thoughts ...trying to thin the line between black and white ..to not split..to feel complete.....

depression,"Condolences card? Yes or no? Hi everyone,
As I already mentioned in a former post, I lost a freelancing job that meant very much to me over false allegations. 
This was one of the main triggers that pushed me back into a major depressive episode and being suicidal.

I‘m currently in the process of acquiring a lethal amount of prescription drugs and to make things easier for my parents, I thought I might ask my former boss to send them a message expressing his condolences etc and act like I was still working for him when I died so they won’t be disappointed and I think they would feel a lot better. 

Is that a good or a bad idea?"

I dont have enough guts to tell my parents that i failed as they have many exceptions from me.
I am willing to be better version of myself but cant due being sick.

Thanks."
depression,"I (15M) want to get diagnosed but I’m scared of the consequences. My mother has friends whose child have depression, she talked about how that child is now forced to live with their father, and he practically made them stop therapy, forced them to work in his company, and “scared them out of depression”. (My mother supports this)

To worsen this, she also laughs at my scratch marks, joke how “it’s near a vein so scratch deeper so you’d bleed to death”. 

And compares/criticizes me to a drug addict: sleep/wake late, no enthusiasm, appetite, scratches…

I’m afraid getting diagnosed or telling would only make it worse.

I genuinely don’t know what to do. Advice needed.

(I live in Vietnam, which does not have family doctor, counselor; mental health isn’t really cared about; the only place to get diagnosed is at a hospital but I need a guardian to come with me and my dad is quite a traditionalist)"
depression,there's no point I have no skills and no purpose. The one thing I had got taken away from me and I have no desire to try to get it back.

depression,My Son My Son is experiencing intense depression. I am desperately looking for a forum to hopefully connect with some other parents to get some advice on the best way to help him.

depression,"My counsellor has told me I have to learn to see myself as a person with value, but I don't know that I can CW: References to abuse

As said in the title, during one of our sessions my counsellor told me that in order to properly deal with my negative mental spirals I need to learn to see myself as a person with value, but I don't think that I have value at all, and I have no idea how to think differently. 

My mere existence has been an active detriment to those that I love, such as my mother who only stayed with my abusive father because she felt she had to for me and my brother and likely would have left sooner if it was only my brother, as she'd been waiting for me to get older before she planned to do so and had already told my brother this. My brother himself likely wouldn't have faced as much abuse if my father hadn't found myself as an infant so rage-inducing, which is what led to my brother having to step in to defend me.

I want to believe I have value, but I truly feel like I have nothing to show for the life that I've lived and I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me."

I have a small amount of savings. I work a low income as a teacher. I keep telling myself things will turn around, there's still time for me to be person I want to be.

depression,I can't figure out how to fix my life I've had a rough 3 or 4 years and it just keeps going down hill. I used to be somewhat alright everything was going my way. I was in love I had friends all my family was still talking to each other and I wasn't bullied for the first time during my school career. Everything started to change and go down hill during my junior year. My ex said that we were still just not going to be hang while she started her first year of college. She ghosted me not even 2 weeks later for 2 months and blocked me on almost everything. I found out she started cheating on me and was making plans to move to Florida with her new partner. I was heart broken and when I explained how I was feeling during the exchange of each others items all she had to say was I don't care get medication. After that I thought i was at my lowest point then my friends ghosted me started avoiding me people who I consider closer then family acted like I was nothing to them. Then they started bullying me for my last 2 years of high-school. Combined with quarantine and isolation I just got worse. 3 months after my 20th birthday my grandmother who raised me passed and my grandfather kicked me out the day after Christmas. During this time I got a job which pays me chump change. I've also realized it's become incredibly hard for me to date or even talk to people for extended periods of time. I don't know what to do anymore or how to improve my life
depression,"I am more and more mentally tired despite the antidepressants. Do you have some tips to ""recharge"" myself ?"
depression,"How to help someone who is depressed but refuses help? I (F23) have a friend (M28) who has been depressed since I met him in 2017. We've been friends for 5 years now and his depression has gotten worse and worse and it's to the point where his only ""solution"" is to unalive himself. The only reason he ""stays"" is because I asked him not to kill himself. 

I've tried talking to him for years about going to therapy (he thinks therapists are scammers that only want his money) and he refuses. He just suffers alone. I'm his only friend. The only person he can talk to. And I understand how bad depression can be, but I believe it's starting to take a toll on my own mental health. Every conversation with him is depressing. Always telling me all these horrible thoughts he has and no matter how many times I've tried to convince him otherwise, sent him self help resources, sent him stories from other people in the same situation, none of it helps if anything he uses it as another reason to be depressed? Because he's ""different"" from everyone else, he isn't ""human"" (his words). I am at a serious loss. I don't know how much longer I can keep this going, I don't know how else to help. I've looked at other people with similar situations and the advice is usually ""Just say that you'll always be there for them, they don't have to be happy but just being there to offer help when they need it. Maybe just play games with them or spend time with them."" But that doesn't help either. He doesn't want to play games, or watch movies, or do anything. He says he doesn't have motivation for ANYTHING. He just exists. I'm afraid to stop being his friend because I think he will actually do something drastic. 

What to do?"
depression,"ADHD My ex, recently ended our relationship. He has ADHD. He said he ended the relationship bc he can’t even do basic things, so why be in a relationship if he can’t be good. He also said he needs to better himself, and learn to love himself. It feels that he’s been depressed or in an ADHD spiral for over a year: 
- he got in a lot of trouble at his first attorney job 
- he then got fired from his second attorney job 
- it’s been 9 months and he never was able to get a job 
- he gained a ton of weight (over 50 pounds). 
- his emotions seem out of control (he would explode over things like dog hair)
- he said he doesn’t feel worthy to be my person 
He has lots of toxic self talk. 
-everything feels like rejection to him 
- I am now realizing how much he lies about things (masking). 

Something that I struggle with, is so many things that I would do out of love for him, he would twist them as something very negative. I had to travel for work for an extended amount of time so I offered to have groceries delivered, and a cleaning person. I was doing this, recognizing this was my role around the house, and so I wanted to still contribute from afar. He took this as me saying he didn’t know how to take care of himself or the dogs. 

He also said we were fighting a lot, which isn’t my reality, but also we were fighting because of his headspace. He was unwilling or unable to come to the table as a partner so issues weren’t getting resolved. 

Part of his spiral/masking is he wouldn’t communicate. He would say yes to tasks and then not do them and be surprised when I was frustrated or disappointed. 

He also said he wants to try again and that our relationship is important enough to try again. 

Has anyone who has ADHD experienced this, and would be comfortable sharing their perspective. As someone without ADHD, I’m really struggling to understand a lot of it. Or if there’s a non-ADHD partner who has gone through this, I would love to hear your experience  as well."
depression,"I'm such a failure I really want to have a family one day but can't even support myself. I've never had a job worth even the national average salary, never moved out my parents' house, never passed the driving test. I'm still a virgin and this year my only partner dumped me after 2.5 years for someone else with no one else on the horizon. I still really wish I had gotten the job I wanted at 18, I'd be so much better off having done that instead of the reluctant, unhappy time at university, I didn't really make any friends or have any good times, not even showing up to my graduation. Sure I have a satisfactory full time office job now thanks to the placement year I did, but only after over a year of not having/ a shit one.

I'm only 34, but I'm tired of living. Nothing is fun, nothing is interesting. I have the attention span of a lima bean and I absolutely hate my job and would quit if I didn't need the money to survive. I'm constantly comparing myself to other people and I hate it. I wish I could be like them; motivated, beautiful, and happy. But I don't know how to stop. Last night I went to sleep and found myself literally begging whoever is listening to not let me wake up.  I don't know what to do or who to turn to. My family wouldn't understand. I really do feel like I'd be doing them a huge favor if I wasn't around because I feel like a huge burden.

depression,"Meh I’m a 33 year old male from the south, and struggled with depression since I was a teenager. I work in a lumberyard.

depression,"Just life I really came here to vent for a second. Life for me has just been almost unbearable. It truly feels like a rollercoaster. One moment things are ok, and the next things are just falling a part. I’ve lost a lot of wonderful people in my life in the course of just 2 years. Every time I’ve gotten on social media to catch up with what I’ve been missing out on, there are just events and news that are just astounding; some good and some bad.

It’s putting into perspective how life can change in just a heartbeat. One moment someone is getting married, another someone’s having a baby; one moment you hear your best friend is gone, or your brother or mother. It’s so unpredictable, and lately life has been insanely unpredictable, I almost can’t keep up anymore. It hard to be happy, when there’s a lot of sadness. Of course appreciating the happy moments can get you by, but only for a moment until sadness comes in.

Since the pandemic began. I’ve been through a break up and make up with my current boyfriend, which was exhausting to say the least. I lost an aunt that meant the world to me. The next year I lost my brother. Then the next year I lost one of my best friends. Today, I found out another one of my best friends lost their mother. I had another friend tell me she was pregnant by her abusive husband. Another aunt I’m close with told me she had a seizure and fell on her face just last week. I mean the list goes on and on. I graduated with my associate of science degree a few months ago, but it feels like I can’t even be truly happy and celebrate that feeling knowing what’s been going in my life and the world.

If you add the bullshit going on all over the world, on top of the bullshit that’s been going on in my life personally; it just feels unreal. Like, I’m apart of some nightmare or dream, and can’t wake up. It’s been unbelievable the amount of stress that’s been put on me, my friends, and family. I wanted to vent here because everyone in my life is already going through so much, and I don’t want to bombard them with talking like this.

Depression was already kicking my ass prior to all of this, but now I feel so numb and heartbroken that it’s hard to even tell if I’m depressed. It’s almost hard to cry now because I’ve shed so many tears already that I feel like none won’t come out. Although I know that I have to keep going, stay positive, and keep my head up. But, I just don’t know how right now. I feel alone, and isolated. I wish I could just not give a fuck, but it’s just not in me. My mind is constantly racing, and I just can’t seem to breath and take a break. Life is like the ocean, so full of unknowns, many scary, many beautiful, but I guess right now I’m in the scariest part of the ocean. I’m still young and have a lot more life ahead of me, but with that being said; I am terrified as to what life has in store. I guess fear is just a four letter word right?

TL;DR

It hurts so bad, the thought to just abandon my beloved family behind. I love them so much!
This is beyond suffering. So folks
Be happy for your fucking bodys
Be more grateful
See you on the other side &lt;3"
depression,"Am I worth it I don't know when it started but the earliest memory I have of hating myself was when I was probably 8, i don't remember the details but i remember cursing myself for being a pain and a burden to my parents. I didn't bother with school or grades and just wanted out of that house. There hasn't been a day nor second that goes by where I don't think of ending it all but I'm still too weak and scared to follow through.
I felt like wasn't able to achieve anything before my grandma died, a year after that my grandad died from covid and not so recently my dad ignored his heart condition and is now going through rapid neuro degeneration.
Sorry for not being a good storyteller"
depression,"I'm Afraid I wake up everyday panicking about my isolation. I blame others for being isolated, but the truth is I've pushed \*most\* (not all) of these people away. My birthday was a few days ago and it was like getting a bucket of cold water dumped on me. That day was the reality check that I don't have many people I'm close to. I'm lucky to have a few. I cry everyday and I drink a lot. I am afraid of being around crowds of people (PTSD) and that certainly makes this worse. Loud sounds (esp. ones that sound like gunshots) shake me up. This anxiety feeds into my depressed feelings because I feel completely HOPELESS. HOPELESS!!

I am in therapy but I am still stuck. I only have 5 sessions left and I love the person I'm working with. I don't know what to do. I've never made a post like this, but then again, I've never felt this defeated, self-hating, and alone. I'm scared."
depression,I'm leaving I think it's time for me to leave this community now. Wish me luck
depression,"i broke the loop so for the past 2 ish years i have been alternating between hyper focus and deep depression every week or two and it sucks, and these whole 2 years i didint feel much of anything just go from super depressed and lazy to super productive and overworking myself.

but i went through something that upset me alot and now i feel really really sad, and its refreshing to feel something besides anger and emptiness. Ive been working on channeling this sadness and self-hate into stuff that will make me more appealing as a friend and hopefully partner. 

Im really just typing my thoughts from my very tired brain right now, but i guess what im trying to say is i went from sitting around because i hate myself, to trying to better myself in the hopes that maybe one day i wont hate myself. Thanks for reading my horrible post :)"
depression,"I don't know why nothing feels the same So, I had an argument with my closest friends a couple weeks ago and they didn't talk to me for about a week.

depression,"zipped mouth (pov me) don't speak at work, watch the civilians that surround me &amp; compare myself to them. think of your crush &amp; wonder if there's a path to gaining a relationship with her. drugged up to the point that mask you wear is drowning you from air."
depression,"Not feeling a sense of self If you were to ask people who ""know me"" about me you would get a different answer from almost everyone. That's because some know me as an introvert some as an extrovert some others as a nerd and some others as someone who likes sports. I'm not sure when it began but i remember since little taking popular traids from other people so i can seem more likable. Even if that meant to sometimes seem as a shallow person cuz i used to say to myself ""its ok this aint my real self"". Im 17 now and i seem to have forgotten what i used to call ""my real self"". Now i feel like im just an empty shell thats only good with first impression and thats it. And despite my inner guilt of being like this what hurts even more is seeing people i thought i could have a relationship with get more and more disappointed on how shallow I am once they know me better. Any advice or something cuz its really hard pushing forward like this?"
depression,"Need Advice: Severe depressive phase/burnout Hi fellow redditors,

I'm struggeling with a severe depressive phase and I'm looking for advice from somebody who can relate.

Since Monday I'm struggeling to get out of bed.
I'm feeling exhausted, but i struggle to sleep since my mind is racing back and forth. 
I work in a really demanding job which has been extreme since a couple of months now, so i called in sick.
Haven't been to a doctor on monday. 
In the evening my girlfriend came over and also noticed that something was wrong, but i couldn't tell her about my depression. But she obviously noticed that something was wrong, ended up crying that night since she said something very loving to me. 


The last days have been the same, i always wanted to get up, but couldn't.
Now today I called my Girlfriend and came clean, why we havent seen each other this week.
Also called my mum and my boss and told them that im mentally and physically exhausted to the point where i don't know what to do anymore. 

My girlfriend has been very understanding and gave me a counseling adress where i applied for help.
My boss has also been very understanding and called me off work next week aswell and told me not to worry about not beeing at a doctor for the sick permit. 
I cant believe how much pressure just fell from my heart.

I don't know if this is burnout or depression and i understand that from case to case this varies a lot.

I believe i now took the right steps to go in a positive direction again.
But i wonder about experiences in regards to recovery.

How long did it last?
Was full recovery possible?
What steps helped you?"
depression,"I miss being alone I’ve reached that level of despair where everything feels quiet. Dark. Peaceful. 

When I was single, I felt so lonely I’d get physically ill. 

I miss that now. My wife forces all her responsibility into me and resents me for suggesting she lift a finger. I’m drowning trying to provide for her and her two daughters, who are so spoiled they refuse to use a trash can. They just throw their garbage on the floor. 

Now I’m surrounded by people who use me and hate me. This is a loneliness that’s quiet. And I can’t tell anyone. Once you become a stepparent, you’re not allowed to have feelings anymore. You’re not allowed to say anything bad because “oh the poor kids.” Sorry, I know being a step kid is seriously rough, but being a stepparent is almost equally impossible. Everything I do is just automatically wrong. I’m expected to cook and clean and provide and shut up and fake happiness every second while my “family” treats this like a bed and breakfast. My wife won’t even get out of bed in the morning unless I nag her four or five times. It’s not fair. 

I wish I could just disappear."
depression,"How depression affects your physical health I'm looking for other people's experiences.   


I like to go for walks and when the weather is nice, I hike in the mountains. During my lows I notice a change in my physical health. I get easily tired and exhausted from trips I usually can do just fine. I'm getting nauseous and dizzy, even though I drink a bunch of water. On regular days/good days where I'm not as depressed, I don't experience this when going for the same walk with the same intensity. I've noticed during the spring and summer that there is a very obvious pattern and I don't feel like it's placebo or just in my head. My body and brain kind of restricts me and makes it much harder to go out and move. I did some blood tests some weeks ago and they were perfect according to my doctor. Blood pressure is fine and blood sugar levels are fine. During my walks I like to walk fast and in uphill, and I always get my pulse up. On good/normal days this is not a problem, I'm good at pushing myself and I like the feeling. On days when I'm depressed I get so dizzy and nauseous and I don't manage to walk as fast as I usually do. Since spring about 6 out of 10 walks have been on good days, 4 out of 10 on bad days (yeah I track my stuff). And there's a big difference in how I perform.   


Are anyone else experiencing this? Today is my day off after several days in a row with work. Work has been really busy both physically and mentally. I've been very depressed for the past week and I'm EXHAUSTED. I should go for a walk, but I'm dreading it because of the nausea and dizziness. Going to the bathroom and just moving is really a struggle and heavy, I feel like I'm carrying a bunch of extra weight."
depression,"Need a little advice I’m a 21 year old male 4 months out of county jail. From may of 2018 to March of this year I have been incarcerated, in and out of rehab, and been to the darkest corners of the my mind. Work is extremely difficult because to the aggressive/ oppressive nature of the prison and jail systems. The people i hang out with now are my old friends, hanging out with them is fun but every song I hear that they love to dance too is one that I most likely heard when I was locked up, or some other shity time which was practically every day. 

I have very few friends because I grew up with my mom in the military so I can make new ones quickly but fail to make deep connections and take any relationship to a meaningful level.

Just need some help"
depression,Rocky rocky hills Lately I’ve been feeling more of the want to”give up”. I’ve been clean from sh for close to a year now but I’m nervous I’ll relapse. The thought of letting go again and not fighting seems so comforting yet I know I can’t. I know I can’t throw myself off what progress I’ve already made so I’m just struggling at this point. I knew it was going to be difficult to continue but I didn’t think it was going to be this hard. I think I’m more just trying to say that I’m struggling to say the least now.
depression,Feeling Like it’s over 19 years old feeling like I want to give up already I’m out of work I didn’t go very far in school didn’t even finish year 10 I don’t have anything to my name not a dollar. I haven’t left my house in month’s haven’t spoke to anyone I just spend all day in bed contemplating wether to go on another day I honestly feel like I’m at the end. I know it doesn’t seem like much to some of you but I’m really struggling with life right now just feel alone.
depression,"I called someone the n word today… I’m white, a neighbor was blasting music at 4am, when I asked him to turn it down he refused, I got angry and called him the n word. He threatened to beat me then relaxed and asked me what my actual problem is, I explained to him that I’m only 21 and I already don’t want to keep living, I’m unhappy and unmotivated to be a better person so I do everything I can for confrontation and aggression as those are the only things that make me feel in life, he called his wife and she came over and we talked for about an hour and I explained to them why I feel this way. I apologized for what I said and they said it’s ok people make mistakes and they offered for me to hangout with them and eat food if I ever needed someone to talk to, they told me they care about me and that they don’t want to hear that I hurt myself. I haven’t heard someone tell me they care about me in years, a few weeks ago my mother told me she is over caring about me anymore. I wanted to cry but I couldn’t it isn’t physically possible for me to cry I feel sad and I want to cry but nothing ever comes out I just feel sad and judge myself when I cry. I did something horrible today. I called someone the worst thing I could in hopes that I would get assaulted or even killed, I told them my intentions weren’t to get them to turn off the music but to make them as angry and sad as I was. It didn’t work, they looked right past my rouse and tried to help me after I was so horrible to them. Maybe I really don’t deserve life"
depression,"Living The Same Day Every Day. Nothing will fix this depression. Substance abuse. Sleeping. Oversharing. Isolating and closing myself off. Buying things won't make me happy.

I am so alone. These thoughts keep coming back. Everyone always leaves. I can't focus on anything. I don't enjoy anything. I grow tired of existence. I crave attention, someone to give attention to. Someone that will love me as much as I love them. I have dropped out of college, I don't see a point in anything. There is no future for me. I am devoid of life."
depression,"Degradation of my ability to care I used to dream of doing something. Being someone. Persuing my passion. At one point I got burnt out from my attempts not making a difference and I decided to take a break- then, poof, 6 years went by in a blink of an eye. Dead end job that's easy as hell, but unfulfilling and I'm underpaid. I rent a tiny space that no one wants to visit. I feel too old (30) to get back on track and finish the things I started - I chose a field that requires lifelong learning which at one point was the main selling point but now, I don't care about it, or anything. Psychiatrist gave me pills- now I'm numb and even further from making the changes I probably should make. Everyday I think, what's the point? Of this life? Personally, and as a whole? Why progress? Why try? It's all so pointless. Soon we will all be dead-"
depression,"sad today. same as yesterday, gonna be the same tomorrow I just want something to go well for me, something good to happen.

depression,"someone please. I’m having strong urges. They’re stronger than they’ve ever been. I’ve been SH free for less than 2 weeks and i set a goal for atleast 3. But those dark yet comforting thoughts r coming back again. My parents alr know i used to SH and just came in to check my wrists and they’re nearly fully healed. But i need satisfaction, it’s calling me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Everything’s been great but why are these thoughts coming back? Someone please help me idk what to do."
depression,"I just need to talk. I’m fairly certain this is going to sound pretty generic.. but who knows. 

I’m struggling...

..And I’ve tried to say this clearly and it usually just turns into rambling... so I’ll just explain exactly what is going on in my mind in a paragraph or two and then clarify at the end if necessary.

I’ve been drinking tonight. I’ve been drinking heavily almost every night or so for the past maybe... 4 months or so? Honestly, maybe even longer.
Before this I was down a path of trying to make myself feel better and take my own health into consideration. To be honest, I really felt like I was finally on the path to feeling a true happiness that I haven’t felt since I was like 16 (I should probably clarify that I’m 30 now). I was at a point where I had quit drinking for anything other than company celebrations and even then it was what someone would call “social drinking”.

Anyways... that all changed this year. This year I lost someone I considered to be my little brother. He was the only friend I had for most of my earlier life and influenced a lot of who I am today.
He left in a way that makes me sad that I didn’t notice his cries for help. I feel like I let him down. 

Essentially, I believe this has led to my current mental state. I feel broken, lost.. afraid. 
I can’t stop thinking about the things I shouldn’t be thinking about. I’m scared and don’t know what to do.

What I really.. really need is someone who has been through this and is just willing to talk. 

That’s it, I guess?"
depression,"Shit's Weird So I'm just chilling, right? Vibing to music. Laying on my bed with my face down because apparently my lungs decided to boycott oxygen for a quick minute. So I let myself breathe, y'know, like a normal homosapien. So once again, vibing.
But here's where it gets  f u n k y
Usually I don't think very much about my past, lots of bad. So I'm just laying down, and flashes of stuff that's happened to me and extreme paranoia set in. I have no clue what happened to me, I became shut down and whatnot. This lasted for around 20 minutes until I decided to go to bed. I even had a bad dream once asleep. When I woke up, it continued for like another 20 minutes.
If anyone knows why or what this was. Tell. Before I break your toilet."
depression,"Advice I’ve had depression for 25 years. I just found out both my parents have leukaemia (I’m 35). Does anyone have advice for managing the uncertainty of having a loved one with a chronic illness, combined with managing your own depression and anxiety?"

depression,I got my sister pregnant. What do i do? So guys I’ve been having sexual relationships with my sister for about 6 years. We are twins. It all started at the age of 12 when she slept in her panties next to me. I know it’s messed up but i cant help myself. I rubbed up against her from behind and the rest is history. Ive tried to get away from it multiple times before but no one can please us how we do. She tells me she’s never had anyone bigger then me and i havent experienced the natural gifts she possesses. As time went by i truly fell inlove with her. I truly love my sister and want to marry her one day (If it ever becomes legal). I just don’t know how my family will react to it. I cant afford to lose my family over something like this. I can imagine the craziness that will arise within the family. Ive been depressed the last 2 weeks as she got pregnant. What do i do?
depression,"Demoralised and defeated Well. boys  looks like its all over. Dont think I can get through this dark winters theres no way. So many problems start to finish from living with parasites that have dragged my life to the ground. Wasted my time. I have tried so many things to move out of this mess. Tried so hard. Everything, but stuck in the same place. Tried moving out for one year with no result, even done driving lessons which complete strangers that did fuck all for me. Looked all over for my purpose in life and just have no answer for it all. I don’t want to do anything and I’m not motivated by anything of this world. All I know is I don’t want to be here. I had this imagination of seeing better days, the sunny days and just being in the moment, but those days just never came. I’m 28. I’ve never had a life of my own. Nobody is thoughtful Nobody is on my side. Everyone makes me out to be a villain and barely takes the time to get to know me. And after yesterday. I aint going back to old ways. People talk shit online, people talk shit in real life, I cant get away from it. You know, to think some people I know sit at home all day, get spoonfed like a fucking manbaby when theyre near 40, and somehow have girls at their room (most likely minors) act fake and try to tear me down when they see me doing something great. Thats what all of them do. But I, try so hard, I get out there and make the effort to talk/find people. But nobody talks to each other, nobody cares about each other and everyone is afraid of each other? Why are they afraid to be their authentic selves? I’m starting to lose hope and don’t have the energy no more. Its not about motivation. I’ve always had motivation, but sometimes its about being realistic. I know when im in unjust situations, when im screwed and considering all the health problems i have, especially havent been sleeping for weeks and months, being plagued by stress and thoughts. I cant do it no more. Im a real person. I dont do this for attention. But I do need to speak to those who understand. I cant be in this alone. But sometimes you have to question if you are the problem, considering all the junk on social media these days, and blind hate online. I cannot tolerate any more negativity. But I need something new. I just dont know what it is yet. I would do so much were I not slowed down by harsh weather, health problems and mental stress. You would wonder whats going on, and I definitely am now. Im just so tired. Maybe I will write later but cant do it no more."
depression,"Not sure if I’m having a mental breakdown… feels like that I mean, I have absolutely nothing at this point. Mobile is on wifi and that’s also most likely getting lost in the following weeks.
I’ve had a very bad three years, my sister passed in 2019… in December 2018 I was fired from my job without any payment whatsoever. By the end of 2019 I started to work again but COVID came and I got fired again and at the same time my mom passed suddenly in the middle of that madness… did not had a funeral and she die alone at the hospital. Of course family is not even close but you know, we got together when that happened but obviously, her sisters blamed me for not changing her to a private hospital and yup, super nice and all my extended family.
2020 was hard, 2021 a friend offered me to babysit her baby so i moved in with her family… I got a job with a better pay I’m September and I came back to my country/home…, but of course in December out of nowhere I got fired again with little money and nothing else.
I’ve spend the last 7 months looking for jobs… spending the money that I had and today, I have nothing left… no job (interviews that get me nowhere) no family and tons of things that I am selling but nothing ends up going…
I am just not ok, I don’t see a light or I don’t feel I am getting a break.7 months and life feels just not fair… 
I am with no plan I am literally frozen having 0 dlls in the bank, prob getting evicted from my place and just one thing after the other…. It’s just too much"
depression,"Life just simply isn’t worth living. I feel like I don’t feel anything, no likes or dislikes, no opinions on anything at all. I know nothing about myself, I don’t even know my own favorite food. and no matter what new thing I try I hate it. In 17 years i’ve become “good” at 1 thing and that’s spinning pencils. I lack all motivation and my social skills are awful. I literally can’t express my emotions and i just end up hurting people because of this. I have no goals or anything i wanna do in life. Do I wanna go to college? Get married? Have kids? I truly don’t know. My life is just in a downwards spiral and it just gets worse and i’m seriously reaching my breaking point. To top it all of lately i’ve been feeling completely disconnected from the reality, I look at my dog and I know it’s my dog but I can’t process it as a real thing. I can’t even imagine my future self cause I don’t feel like I even exist. I’m completely lost and idk what to do."
depression,"Haven’t told anyone this… It feels as if I’ve been hollow for the past few years. I’m 20, nearly done with college and working toward becoming a pilot. I work a decent job, have some friends, have a couple hobbies, and have a good relationship with both my parents and siblings. Despite all of this, I’ve never felt content with my life. It’s not that I want more, it’s just that it’s never felt like any of it matters. Most days I just wish I could die. I’ve felt this way since I was about 14. Nobody knows this, and in a way I’m fine with that. I know if I told my friends or family they’d be concerned and try to help, but deep down I know that their efforts would be utterly wasted on me. My life is and will remain wholly insignificant. I understand that I may be important in other people’s lives, and honestly it’s the only thing that prevents me from killing myself. I know committing suicide would place an immeasurable burden on the shoulders of those around me, and I don’t feel like I matter enough to force my pain onto others by simply quitting. I’ve lived my life acting content and happy for the peace of others. Living this lie makes me feel as if I’ve stripped myself of my identity. I don’t know who I am and I don’t think I ever will. I don’t want help. I just want somebody, even if it’s just some internet stranger, to know how I feel so that I can convince myself for a moment that I’m not alone wandering as a husk in the world."
depression,"I will never be good enough That's it. I am never good enough for anyone; there's always something wrong with me; I am always a second choice -- or mostly, not a choice at all. I am unlovable and I will always stay alone.

I'm too timid, too insecure, too introverted. I have been rejected my entire life. Always in the same ways. Some people point out my low self-esteem and say I need to be more confident, but that feels like lying to myself. I can't do it.

I am always nice to other regardless because I know how it feels to be treated poorly. Maybe I should stop doing that, but I can't. All this rejection made me a people pleaser with terrible social anxiety.

I do know one thing: I wasn't made for this world. I will never fit in. I really believe my life is utterly pointless here. I could kill myself and it wouldn't make a difference. The world doesn't need people like me."
depression,"I feel like my life isn’t worth it I’m single lonely and it’s hurting me so bad . I look at people that are happy like couples etc and I look at me my friends live far away don’t travel much not into what I like and I’m just having to hold on .

depression,"Why can't I feel happiness properly? I don't know where I should start. I'm not in any dangerous situation or environment at the moment, but I was up until a few months ago.

My problem is that I can't remember the last time I've actually been happy and content. Sometimes, I do have split moments of relief and happiness, where I think ""Hey, everything is actually going to be okay"" and ""Things aren't so bad after all"". 
These moments are over as soon as they begin; they don't even last a second. I'm immediately pulled back into reality.

Of course, I do have great, funny moments in my life which I'm thankful for. Still, most of the time I feel monotone, careless and apathetic. Friends and hangouts, good grades, hobbies, whatever...They don't really make me very happy. Nowww I'm rambling and realize this all makes 0 sense when I explain it. 

Last time I've gotten a rush of serotonin was when I bit into a chocolate chip cookie more than a year ago. Yum!"

depression,"Someone genuine to talk to. 5 years depressed with no one to talk to I’m 20 and turning 21 this month. It’s been 5 years depressed, lonely, and friendless. It’s the worst it’s ever been I’ve need felt more depressed and suicidal now. The last 5 years have been miserable. Dropped out of school at 15, friendless as a trauma response I cut everyone off. Lost friends and have genuinely on my life no one. From depression and trauma I’ve got a binge eating disorder and gained weight. I’ve been skinny my entire life I feel fat and disgusting. I feel like no one would ever want to talk to me bc I’m so fat but I see girls 5 times my size with friends and ppl who want to be around them. I’m not even that fat and I feel like a cow. I’m not in college and don’t even have my high school diploma. I thought I’d kill my self a long time ago so I never even tried to get it. Everyday I’m disassociated and feel like life is fake. I’m so suicidal it takes over all my thoughts every single day. I cry everyday uncontrollably and lock myself in my room. I don’t know how my parents still believe in my and support me. I long for just another human to talk with and hug. A shoulder to cry on or someone to care. My 21st birthday spent alone so pathetic I look at my self and genuinely want to hurt myself. Such a failure at something so simple . I tried to make friends on bumble bff. I met some ppl but after a while it becomes tasking to try to seem interesting. Depression has genuinely sucked the life out of me. I’m so boring and robotic. It doesn’t help that I’m nerodivergent I hate myself. I wish I was a normal 20 year old girl In school, doing hobbies, having girlfriends, going out. I don’t care too much about romantic relationships I just want a friend in life. Everyone needs someone every human needs love. And God couldn’t give me that. I pray for the bare minimum and get nothing. I feel cursed . Every time I feel like I’m close to having a normal life I get hit like a truck back to reality. I’m so unlovable. So miserable. I’ve never felt more suicidal in my life. I have a burning feeling all over my body hearing these suicidal thoughts in my head every minute of the day I want to scream out loud. I just want the bare minimum ."

I have two kids they are 11, and 15, and have had many bouts before due to my social anxiety issues.  But usually am good at managing to keep things together.  But yeah this feels different and so much harder.  I just feel plain despair.  I'm gonna hopefully get better.  But yeah this has been really hard.

depression,"how to help/ prevent depression I (19F) have been home from university for about a month now and am feeling the depression start to sink in. I always know Im getting bad when I cry randomly throughout the day with the obvious sadness for no reason. It doesn’t help that I’ve been struggling to get a job but I finally have on starting monday. I was just looking for some tips on how to help myself since my motivation is very low and I want to avoid going back on medication.
I haven’t told anyone how Im feeling as my best friend is already going through a lot with her grandma hospitalised. Im not feeling ready to tel my mum yet. My other best friend is a guy who i’m in a situationship with but idk how to mention it to him without him thinking it’s for attention/ make him feel bad even though it’s really nothing to do with him. I feel like telling him might be my best shot at opening up but idk how, any ideas?"

depression,"I feel too broken to be loved or even befriended. I genuinely have nothing good to say, if I try, I have to lie. I'm always so miserable and anxious. Severe depression took over my life.

depression,"How much would a quick ""just checking up on you"" matter to you? I was reading a article about the problems University students are facing due to mental health problems and a lot of them being lonely, so I want to ask the question how much will it matter to you if a person or a program checks up on you on a daily/weekly basis and asks about your day/week for me it would be great but what are your thoughts on this"
depression,"It's my only option Hi... i'm alon i am a 20 years old man and i'm at a point in my life that i feel like my only option is killing myself.

I've been keeping my traumas and thoughts to myself by hurting myself spending money on weed and other people.

I'm in debt and i can't keep asking my family to help me, i was just kicked out of my apartment bc of a mental breakdown i had. I barely feel like i'm a person anymore.

My intrusive thoughts that are caused by ocd are killing me, i'm afraid ill kill someone or hurt someone i love, and it's taking every bit of energy i have left to not act on them.

I don't have hobbies, i barely do anything i just keep lying to myself. No one really knows me bc i lie about everything in my life, i'm a pathological liar i hate everything, i don't even know who or what i am anymore. I don't even know what is true about me.

I lost my job which is the only place i felt people appreciated me. 

I'm piece of human shit just walking around till i die

Well ig that's it see ya..."
depression,"I haven’t taken my hormones in 3 months I, am a trans dude. I started T back in november, but since may, i just haven’t had the energy to take it every day. I stare at it every time i pass it, and I just can’t bring myself to put it on, i’m exhausted just looking at it. And it’s not like i don’t want to take it, I absolutely do, but I just can’t force my brain into doing it. Does anyone know any tips for getting my depressed ass to take his hormones? 

I should note that it’s only my testosterone, and I use the gel. my anxiety meds I still take consistently.

depression,"If my child’s mother gets her way and I can’t see my daughter, I will kill myself. I don’t know what more and what to say other than that. I can’t stop thinking about my daughter. I can’t stop worrying about if she’s okay. I can’t stop worrying about when the last time she had a diaper change or ate was. I haven’t slept much over the last few days-yesterday I was going off what sleep I had from Tuesday (maybe an hour?). 

When I’m able to sleep to the point I dream, it involves her, and I wake up and realize she’s almost 5 hours away and start crying all over again. I just want to know she’s okay, I just want to know she’s still laughing, smiling, playing. I want so bad to wrap my arms around her and hold her and dance and play with her. 

I have been waking up these last few days at 6:00 like I would before, as if I was still waiting to hear her waking up and rustling around in her crib. I have been sitting here with empty hands at 6:30, when I would typically be holding her, 6:45 when I’d start to try to give her breakfast, 7:00 when I’d try to change her (and she’d inevitably squirm around and fuss because she hates being changed). And now at 7:26, I can’t help but miss and want the little hurricane she can be in the morning. 

I love her so fucking much and I can’t live on this earth if I can’t have a relationship with my daughter."

Oh noooo, some fucking millionare youtuber dropped dead. Who cares? Honesty? I can't stand these fucking schmucks on youtube who literally are multi-millionares and yet pretend to be just like us, like the common fucking person.

You fuckers don't even care about the half a million people literally dying EVERY DAY IN IRAQ, SYRIA, AND NOW IN EASTERN EUROPE? You people think just because someone has an audience their life is more valuable then some random person on the street?

depression,"Why was I the only one cut out of her life I just recently broke up with my girlfriend of 2 and a half years. She had fell hard because of depression after school ended and said when she downward spirals she cuts everybody out of her life. We are also neighbors and work together so I always thought it was fate that we met. The break up I thought was good and she blamed herself for the relationship ending and I tried to comfort her saying its on both of us.

Well anyways, why was I the only one cut out. She hasn’t talked to me at all at work. She is avoiding me. We haven’t had one conversation in 1 month. She does have past trauma because her past boyfriends treated her terribly with other things I shouldn’t go into. She has hopped relationship to relationship before she met me. I was her 5th boyfriend. She said she wanted to find herself and she had to go on this journey on her own.

I know it’s hurt ego but she seems more happy without me. Laughing which sounds like daggers to my heart. My other friend says she is faking it since she has always worried about others than herself. I just feel like I am becoming the outcast at work. I was also really jealous of another guy at work before the breakup and she said she didn’t understand why. He’s whatcha call a Casanova with a body count of like 12. She says she is not looking for a relationship and told her friend to slap her if she tries to go into another one.

The biggest heart jerk to me is saying she does want me in her life and that she has gotten back together with exes before. I’m just so lost In life now and I still love her deeply. She was the first real relationship I had and just don’t understand what happened to where she would avoid me to that extent."
depression,"You will all eventually follow me, and I shall lead you. For I am the one to lead the world into a new Enoch. After all is done, and you've read and listened to my sermons. You will know the light, see it even. Why? Because I said to myself I will lead, I have always known I would one day lead an army, a commune, a faith into the new world. When everything falls into flames, and this mortal earth is a singed husk. When we arise from the ashes, the ruins. We will create anew. A world where there is no more suffering. No more pain. No more hate. No more notion of the ""self"". Where we are all truly equal, and some of you may fight, you may try to spew your venom.

I really love where she lives, there's so many big trees.
 Do you know how bad are my days at my home ?
 It is mentally killing me.     

 
I then come back at her place because, oh man, it was so hot outside. Upon checking on social media, i see bad news...
My heart is broken ! I am holding tears even now when i'm writing.


Life is short, i've never belived in that, i have now just realised how short it can be.
Never be afraid to do what you wish.
You consider yourself an useless resource wasting lifeform ? So what ? I mean... I can relate to that actually.
But if you give it time and patience, you can learn so much and do so much for yourself. 
I don't know you and what situation you are in right now, but i fucking love you. I want to hug the shit out of you right now. I have seen so many threads on this subreddit that i might actually do it i see one of you irl. 
Don't give even one gram of shit of what people think you're of you.


    
    This man has been hiding his suffering with his incredible humour and personality. I will never forget him. I have admired him for a long time, he was my idol, he made me and others laugh. Life just gave me a lesson on how bad things can get if i keep thinking so negative.

depression,"What’s wrong with me All of my friends are going out with girls but all my life all the girls I’ve liked have disappeared. Im 19 and a virgin and I know I’m ugly but I’m still 6’4 and jacked and funny and I’m a real gangster. I don’t understand what girls are put off by. It makes me so sad when I see happy couples and it makes me violent when my friends talk about sex. Im genuinely confused on why I’m always so alone and why no girl has ever shown any interest in me. Im shy and reserved but only because no one has ever shown interest in me. I used to be very extroverted and have lots of friends. I used to be the class clown but these failed attempts at attracting women have left me so nervous that nowadays I can barely look a pretty girl in the eyes. My family pressure me into finding a date, I get embarrassed when people ask about my love life considering I’m 19 and have never kissed a girl in my life. This makes me sad then sadder. Then I get angry and angrier. Then I fall back into the comforting arms of Xanax and weed. Wtf is wrong with me. I fucking hate seeing happy couples. If I were a polar bear I would kill the boyfriend and steal the hoe. Im an alpha male and a big man why can’t I find a lady"
depression,"Fed up I’ve got depression anxiety and fibromyalgia so my whole life seems just be feeling anxious upset suicidal and in constant pain that only get worse with panic attacks. Some days I can’t even get out of bed and it hurts to breath. As I’m living with this and every time I get a flare up of anything I just try and sleep and hope it passes instead of going to the hospital 50 mins away the doctor and work agency have said I’m fit to work as it doesn’t look like there’s anything wrong with me. So fed up just wish it would end and people would believe how awful the pain is and the thoughts are never ending and tiring. I see fake people posting on fb oh I’m so depressed I’m going to kill myself
Then 5 mins later posing in photo shots so people think if you have depression your faking it. Just so annoyed has anyone found and help thanks"
depression,"What’s wrong with me?? I’ve hit a wall. Legit don’t know what to do. I even started therapy and I come out of therapy with more questions than before. I think I have either adhd or depression. I told that to my therapist and she just said “those are labels psychiatrists give to people. So here we are trying to work on the things that cause those feelings”. Sure yeah we work on those things but I don’t see any result here. I struggle so much to find motivation to do anything. Most things I do is because I’ve just learnt to do them like cleaning the house,drawing,taking a bath. I’m not saying I don’t enjoy doing stuff anymore whatsoever but I feel like I’m completely lost. Therapist says I have a problem identifying my emotions so we are working on it. I’ve read that it helps setting goals. How the hell do I do that? I’ve no idea what that means. Even if I find something I will be excited the first minutes of trying to achieve this goal rebut then it becomes pointless. That’s legit my whole life, getting excited for something and then meh. I’m not sure if all this was always there but I noticed just now cause there are more responsibilities…"

depression,"I can't help him get better if he doesn't want help? I'm a empathic fixer. Always have been. If I can't fix it, I help you see why it can't be fixed and how it got broken in the first place. I finally found someone I can't fix. I just don't know what else to do, as he doesn't want to be helped.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: He was dating this girl for several years, they were planning on settling down to start a family. They took a normal vacation, got back and she walked out, never to be heard from again. YEARS gone. He's now broken, severely depressed and miserable. All he does is think of ways to end his life. Typical guy, almost 30, hates his job, very attractive.

At first I tried the usual keep it casual and open flirtations (We're 2k miles apart) until I got to know him better. One day I realized his depression was a lot more serious than the average person goes through - on top of all this, severe social anxiety. 

All his friends have long-term committed relationships, he's jealous and lonely. He's oblivious to women and their advances in general but wants to settle down. He seems to think that it's the only way to be happy again. 

As for his job misery, I'm working on helping him with his resume -he needs out of that job in particular, and he does agree with that. 

But how can I help someone who hates to talk or socially  interact? I've already gotten farther than any of his other friends in digging in to the issues, but can't seem to push past whatever it is that's truly holding him back. It hurts to see him hurt so much. Most of us keep things as light and casual as we can in group settings so as not to focus on the crippling depression and make him feel self conscious about it."
depression,"lying in bed all day? Does anyone else lie down in bed all day doing literally nothing? This is the first time this has happened to me so have a few questions...

How long does this last for ?
Why am I even doing this ? Is it just low motivation?
Will I ever get better ?

Thanks in advance"
depression,"Relapsing after feeling better sucks (Just a vent). It's because I know what it feels like for things to be good, and it's so frustrating that life isn't that way in the present and I'm just so fucking exhausted of trying and trying and trying. I open my heart to the world and the way I fall back in my pit again is so hard and it's just so exhausting to climb back out again. I have no friends to cry to and no money to pull myself out of my current mess. I've been broken up with and I'm too mentally unstable to hold a job that would barely pay for my medication and therapy (I have Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, severe anxiety and I'm also on the spectrum. I've tried the free therapy services and it's not been helping. Some say my case is too complicated, some just give out anti-depressants without acknowledging the other problems. I need money for better services). This really sucks!!!!! Sorry I'm just venting because I'm exhausted and I just want to be okay again. Not perfect but at least okay enough to push through another battle. Now I'm barely even that. I'm so exhausted and hurt."
depression,"Ways to cope with rage Whenever i fail at something, or feel like i'm bad at something, i rage. Just today i wanted to draw something related to a project i'm creating, and literally 10 seconds into the sketch things didnt work out and i closed the app, sat with my face in my hands for half a minute, and started up the program again in an effort to try again. Once again, things didnt turn out well within seconds and i just give up, slammed the desk, turned off my pc and layed on my bed with innapropriate anger and irritability. Sometimes i even hurt myself by punching myself or punching objects. Does anyone know how to cope with this?"
depression,"I can't play Fortnite without feeling worthless and hating myself I'm such worthless trash at this game. I drop down, land, die, get danced on and humiliated, rage, punch myself and contemplate suicide, and then rinse and repeat over and over again. This game has been driving me insane and I just hate myself for being such trash. No other game has made me feel so worthless like this. Every single time I die I just rage so hard... I can't help but impulsively and violently start punching myself. I just hate the thought of some streamer killing me with tons of ppl watching and he's all like ""man this kid is trash!!"" and everyone in the chat is all ""LOL you shit on that guy he sucks!!!"" and every single time I die I think about how they recorded that kill and I hate myself and think about what I could have done differently to not die..... It's as the saying goes: it sucks to suck.... and that's me right there. Not only do I suck at the game... but then I get shit on and danced on and humiliated and I hate myself so fucking much and I feel like such a worthless piece of fucking garbage that's worthless to society I'm just a loser getting his ass kicked all day in Fortnite I just suck and I hate myself so much for it...

And I know I'm gonna get comments of someone saying ""dude it's just a game -\_-"" .......oh yeah? Well if it's just a game... then why does everyone feel the need to dance on me and humiliate me literally every single time they kill me to make me feel bad about myself? Why do I get labeled as ""trash"" for not being good it seems people take it pretty seriously for a ""game"". Why do streamers like Tfue and stuff call everyone they kill trash and make fun of them for getting killed? If it's just a game why is it so humiliating for someone to die and you get to dance and shit on them and call them trash?

Does anyone know a way I can just get bot lobbies from now on? I bought this battle pass (first one I bought for this game) and I can hardly bring myself to finish these quests... trying to go for quests while ppl are just trying to kill you is also such annoying trash... I just want bot lobbies so I can do these quests and then not have to play the br mode anymore.

It's like I'm addicted to this game... I can't stop playing cause when I get my ass kicked and get danced on if I turn the game off and try to go do something else I'll just be all alone thinking to myself what a worthless piece of trash loser I am for getting my ass kicked like that I'm just a weak little loser who gets his ass kicked... so I keep playing in hopes of actually getting a kill and trying to redeem myself so I don't hate myself and wanna puke every single time I look in the mirror. I can never manage to get more than 5 kills in a match... every time I land near people I die immediately within 2 seconds, and then every time I land far from everyone I spend 10 minutes getting all the best loot I can just to die in 2 seconds again when I run into someone.... I'm just worthless fucking trash and there's literally no reason for me to play this game... but I bought this battle pass and wanna at least get all the stuff in it so I at least get my money's worth or whatever... I have bruises all over my leg from freaking out over this game... I get so angry my head hurts so bad whenever I play this and I just want to end myself so badly for being such worthless trash at this game"

depression,"today, tomorrow, next week, next month - its always the same I'm at a point where it's beginning to hurt, if you know what I mean you know. Everyday is the same agonizing day of feeling numb, worthless, hopeless, a burden.

You start to forget what anything feels like. Maybe some things are okay, but most is not. I'm dead inside.

Today felt like a month ago, just a different day. I can't sleep anymore, been up for 2 days. My only escape is drinking yet I have nothing at the moment and I'm freaking out.

I'm not convinced it will get better. Nothing will. Its pointless."
depression,"i am getting bullied and don't know how to handle it. i am getting bullied at school because i am fat, i weigh less then almost everyone i know but still get picked on about it, as of recently i have been sucking in my gut to appear less fat. also i made a stupid decision in school now everyone knows and i am also being picked on about that as well, (i would not like to say what i did).

i also feel as if no one is being honest with me, my reasoning of this is because my class has a group chat that i didn't know about, and i would assume that they purposely excluded me in it.

i have also actively heard people mocking and bulling me, although i am fat i have stopped eating a lot  i eat little or nothing at school, i have held back on eating carbohydrates and sugar, also i sometimes make jokes about myself to entertain my friend's and they most of the time take it too far, i don't blame them for it tho because i have made mental changes on myself recently too fast for my friend's to pick it up.

however i am grateful that i am not at a girl and boy school, some might say this is sexist but let me explain, most of the bullying i receive comes from girl's and they would bully me more often then the boys, and in a small way some of the boys in sport support me giving a go but at the same time mock my lack in sport capability.

i don't really know how to handle it, i have been exercising hoping it will help as a way of coping but i am afraid of my dad and brother bullying me for exercising and they have before, one time at my grandma's my dad made a joke about how i am on a diet because i didn't get extra chips after i am done.

my mum is kind and supportive about it tho so that is good, if anyone can relate or help on coping how my dad and my brother bully me please say something."
depression,"I hope it stays dark forever, I hope the worst isn’t over Recently I graduated high school and I got a place in the med university I wanted to get into. Despite that I feel nothing but blank rage and anger all day. 

I cut off contact with every last one of my friends. My mother does nothing but attack me all day for the dumbest shit imaginable and my brother thinks it’s a good idea to bother me all day. I wish I could cut them out of my life too. 

On one hand I wish the anger would stop, it is like a heavy blanket that makes it hard to breathe, eat or sleep. On the other hand I don’t care anymore. 
For the longest time I fought with ever last bit of energy I had to be seen, heard and not be fucking misunderstood all the time. But it is pointless. People will see and hear what they want and twist your words to fit their reality. I hate them so much I almost have to laugh. 

If this is what life will be like forever then I will give up fighting against it. I officially surrender myself to the pointless bullshit people come up with, I will stop trying to be understood and I hope I will get torn apart while doing so. I hope I lose my mind completely so I don’t have to experience this any longer. I am ready for anything now and the only truth that will remain is that I will never forgive.

depression,"I've been feeling like a failure since I graduated I know the title itself might seem like an oxymoron but I sincerely feel that I can't do or get through life as I see things right now.

For some context, I've been trying to get into the state colleges that I could feasibly get to for the past couple of months and the entire process has been draining me and my parents since the past 6 months or so. I was hoping I'd get into atleast one considering my GWA (General Weighted Average) is considered above average in my area but so far, all of the applications have only ever taken me to either a rejection or a waitlist (which usually ends in a rejection anyway).

I know compared to everyone else's problems on this subreddit this might seem exceedingly insignificant or pointless, but I just really needed to vent out the fact that I'm feeling stuck and incapable of doing any good this past couple cause of this whole debacle.

This whole thing has gotten me to question if whether I even want to go to college in the first place and whether it's even something I should pursue if just applying to one god damn college is this much of an obstacle and how much better would I fare actually going through college itself.

I've never felt so stupid or unwanted my entire life prior to having to go through this and some people might view my experiences as just a drip in the bucket shitiness that's to come but I just wanted to atleast get this feeling out of my chest now, lest I let it fester and turn into something more crippling in the future. I guess I really just want to get through all of this over with and try to weather the turbulence around my life but being under all that pressure has really put me into one of the worst mental states I've had the displeasure of experienced so far.

TL;DR I've tried to apply for college, but so far all of them rejected me and now I feel like a useless piece of shit"

depression,"Can I regain my memories? I'm a 23(F) and recently I've been going through some photos on my old phone and saving them to the cloud so I can factory reset the phone and recycle it. The pictures were from 2014-2019 so basically from my highschool years and some college. But going through them made me realize that I have no memory of anything that happened in highschool outside of these pictures. Its been very distressing to say the least.

 I've had depression since I was young and there were some traumatic events along the way so I know that my brain is just trying to protect me from the bad memories. BUT there were some great and amazing moments along the way too. I've mostly come to terms with the fact that I can't remember any part of my childhood, but I never realized that this amnesia would basically cover my entire life. One of my highschool friends has since passed away this year but for the life of me I can't remember what it was like being her friend. 

Is there any way I can regain memories of what my childhood was like? What my friend was like? Please help

depression,"My life is a horrible scary cycle I'm sad and terrified all the time.

I grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother who would routinely beat me. My Dad would sometimes step in but would just receive her verbal or physically abuse. She neve once touched my brother, he was her golden child.

I was bullied in school too - all through it - for being smaller than everyone else. I was born 9 weeks premature, due to my ""not knowing she was pregnant"" and drinking every night. So my body was always messed up with illnesses.

I would wet the bed every night until I was 10 and had to get emergency hernia surgery. I had a hernia (presumably due to the stress of abuse every day) at 10 years old and no one questioned it. Whenever a doctor or teacher would ask about my home life and school life I'd tell them how I'd beaten and abused, but it was just ""tough love"" and ""kids being kids"". 

This continued through high school until my Dad enough and left, I went with him. I had a few friends and just wanted to have fun for a change and it was good. Had some relationships and experiences and my brother left and went to college.

I'm not smart or competent and can barely keep a job. I'm a hoarder with chronic depression and OCD. 

My Mum came back into my life saying she was sick and I went and helped her. She turned out not to be sick at all. But I now stayed seeing her often because she had lied too and abused everyone in her life and is completely alone, majorly depressed. She'd nonstop whine at me like i was a child but never touch me, she can't now.

My brother then got divorced from his wife and was forced to move back to her house, after having no contact and not letting her see her grandkids for 10 years. He stayed for 3 years before escaping and moving in with someone he now deeply loves. She made his life hell while staying there.

She's now sick. Actually sick though. A mass on her Pancras and the very early stages of alzhimers or dementia. 

I'm completely alone except seeing my Dad and brother every so often. I can't maintain relationships and I'm sad and terrified and angry and bitter and lonely all the time. And she's the person who talks to me the most.

I hate this horrible cycle I'm in of being sad and lonely. I have horrible hygiene and ugly rotten teeth. I was beaten and sent to bed early everynight so I never developed the habits and now I'm horrible.

I have no skills or relationships and I can't do anything with life.

I don't know what to do."

I've very controlling parents. they never had a happy marriage and i grew up watching them fight everytime. my mom is very self centered although she do everything it's need to be done to take care of us but she's a narcissist and never really cared about other's mental health. i don't blame her for this but I do blame this culture and our ancestors. they are the reason our parents turned this way. 
I've an elder sister but from the very young age she used to fight back to my parents, but I'm the exact opposite I get silent, listen, absorb and show no reaction. in my teenage there was a phase when I used to absorb everything and when there was no more capacity left i used to go silently in my room and punch my own face and walls with my all power. I'm not good at socializing, I don't have many friends, i lack confidence and I'm full of self doubts.

fast forward to last November, I got into my final undergrad semester and at that point I decided to apply for Grad college in USA. i started working on my applications for different universities. it was a very stressful time for me. On new year i went through a major surgery and i was bed ridden the whole month of January. i attempted IELTS exam in February and i was busy with my university tough schedule exams and all difficult final year stuff and on the other hand i was researching, writing my college essays preparing for interviews. it was veryyyy stressful period. but finally i got into a university with a great scholarship and then i had my toughest final exams. after graduating i started my visa process. for that my parents helped me with my bank statement. but i felt soo much pressure of putting financial burden on my family but at this point I've already spent a lot of their money on ielts, university applications etc so backing out at that point felt sooo useless. 

i feel soo mentally exhausted and depressed with the constant pressure and fear of visa rejection which will ultimately waste all the time, my parent's money I've spent untill now. i feel so bad now that I'm the guy who never cry and today a minor inconvenience happened with my mom and bursted out like a 2 year old baby and i cried a lott and i wasn't able to stop myself from crying. i don't know what's this but i know one thing for sure that I'm mentally not well. i don't know if i fit the definition of depressed or not but i do know there is something wrong with me. I'm stressed, sad and anxious.

p.s. i wrote this while crying and please ignore my bad English as at this moment I can't think properly and I'm not able to convey my thoughts in a better way."
depression,It’s starting again I can feel myself falling back again. When I wake up I already feel empty and cold and tired. I jut want to sleep all the time. I don’t want to eat. I don’t have the energy anymore. I can feel it starting again but I don’t think I’ll still be alive to see it end.
depression,"feeling stuck I feel so down. I feel goalless and directionless. 

I had  a dejavu last night, and it really scared me. 

I dont know how to move forward. I cannot make any major decisions. I feel stuck in here."
depression,"I wish I could go back to 2000s or 2010s If I can't redo my life, at the very least take me back to those years..."
depression,My therapist told me maybe I should just talk to AI bots Idk that was just such a depressing thing to hear. Am I crazy or is that just a weird thing to ever recommend? Made me feel like she thinks I’m never gonna make friends so my last resort is just talking to robots lol
depression,"Abusive ex contacted me after two years I’m at my lowest right now, not just because of my ex contacting me. I’ve definitely felt a lot worst but I have no idea where to go from here. Every time I’ve been depressed, I’ve sort of known why and what I need to do to fix it, but this time I have no idea. On top of that, I’ve been getting fucked over bad recently by stuff out of my control. I’ve felt like this for the past couple of weeks. 

And out of nowhere, after almost two years, my ex contacted me, we dated for almost three years. I woke up yesterday morning to a call and text saying hey from her. I don’t ever see myself responding, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot, probably a lot more than I should. She was abusive and my life essentially revolved around her. 

I didn’t have much of a family growing up. Her family took me in basically and I would spend literally every day with them, sleep over there, eat dinner with them every night, go to family events. I practically lived there. It was really nice on the surface and part of the reason why I stayed for so long. When my relationship was good with my ex, it was really good, almost perfect. And to go from having essentially nobody to a gf and a very loving family, felt amazing. My life finally felt normal in a way. The thing that sucked was that they were all I had. 

My ex was really abusive. She would constantly start fights, invade my privacy, and whenever I tried to leave, which was many times, would threaten suicide. Eventually, she ended up leaving me for someone else and that was that. She tried to get back with me while still talking with the other dude, but I didn’t even entertain it. I started to realize how shitty she was at that time. It hurt a lot to walk away, but I knew it was for the best. 

With all that being said, my life has been honestly pretty bad since. I’ve tried to make a life outside of romantic relationships and it’s been going pretty bad if I’m being honest. I haven’t really found a hobby that has stuck outside of art but I’ve been doing that for years so it’s nun new. I’ve tried making friends, but have been unsuccessful. I do have a few friends from years ago though that I see every so often but it’s a stark contrast from living with a big family and gf. All I have now is myself and my art basically and I think that’s why I can’t get her out of my head now even with how shitty she was. I’m not sure what to do besides give it time and even beyond that, Im so lost in my life."
depression,I feel like my depression is invalid because I’ve never been inpatient. I keep comparing my mental health issues to others and I feel like I’m a little bitch who shouldn’t be complaining because there are people who had to go to the psych ward and I’ve only received outpatient treatment when needing to go to the hospital. I just feel like my mental illness is less valid than everyone else’s and that I’m selfish for thinking that I’m struggling when people have it so much worse.
depression,"no, i am not a good person but i try even though i’m exhausted"
depression,Struggling a lot these days In the last six months everything in my life has changed. The last couple of weeks have been really difficult for me. I'm feeling very isolated and unwanted. I don't have goals or any reason that I want to live. There's only one person in my life that I thought would be there for me and it seems like there's a lot of distance between us now. I don't want to leave my apartment anymore. I have panic attacks constantly. I feel like I'm falling apart.
depression,"hm. i am so tired. its only my second semester of college and i feel sick. i dont want to get out of bed. i dont have the energy to even try. my grades are slipping and i feel like such a useless failure. i constantly tear up and start to cry. i feel so empty. i was trying so hard and it still wasn't enough to amount to anything. i'm having trouble eating or doing anything basic to take care of myself. many times i've thought about dropping out of school entirely because it's just too much for me to handle, but that would probably make me feel even more useless. i'm so far from home and i feel so isolated. i have one friend up here but i don't want to burden her with my problems since she's so busy as is. i miss my room at home. i want my animals back. i want my old job. maybe then i'd feel like im worth something. anything. at this point i dont really have any reason to keep going. instead i just sit in my apartment while everyone around me does something productive but i dont have the energy or motivation to even try anything. i don't necessarily want to commit suicide or die. just disappear. maybe not forever, but for a while. just stop time and come back when i'm ready. growing up and being on my own isn't something i was really ever ready to deal with and it's so hard. i'm so close to just snapping at somebody and i don't know what to do anymore."
depression,"Thinkin about giving up. I know this might not be the right place to post it or anything, but I don’t really know what else to do. I’ve just kinda felt consistently awful about myself regardless of the things I’ve actually done. I’m 18 and I’ve got the opportunity to get into a decent enough college but I really don’t feel like it’s what I wanna do. I don’t really think I’ll be happy regardless of what I choose and I’ve been fantasizing about cutting off everyone I know and just ending it. I don’t feel like I have any value or anything and I feel like if I hadn’t existed in the first place my friends and family would be better off, no matter what they’d say about that. I feel like a drain on everyone, including myself. I dunno. I shouldn’t be as sad as I am but I can’t help feeling awful and like I’m just a big waste of potential. I just wanna end it without hurting anyone more than I already have."
depression,"My therapist said I am not serious about my career I left my job about a month ago as I wasn't so motivated and thus couldn't give my 100% and I started looking for another job. But when I received a couple of rejections, I don't know why but I couldn't apply for any jobs and when I told this to my therapist, she said I am not taking it seriously 😒. 

Its not like I don't want a new job, but I struggle so much to put in that effort, the tasks seems overwhelming. I know that I am very ambitious and knowledgeable and if applied at right place, I would do good. But I am always running away from hard work to get there."
depression,Going to the gym makes me hate myself even more. My body has had enough I used to go gym and be in great shape for all my life. But recently my depression and anxiety has gotten extremely severe which has left my body feeling extremely fatigued. I can barley even shower because of the effort. 2 months ago I could manage a full on workout 20 pull-ups in a row 100 push-ups ect.. not in lucky if I can manage 8 pull-ups and 40 push-ups in a row. My body has just had enough . Anyone else have similar issues ?
depression,Therapy / seeing a psychologist What are your tips for getting the most out of your sessions?
depression,"wishing I started self harming sooner I am innocent. I was still just a kid. I try to be a good person, and I think i do a good job for a human. The only things I regret are not doing the things my therapist told me to do. I wish I had run away, even if it meant being a homeless kid. I wish I had self harmed. I had the urge but always kept it at bay—now my parents who emotionally abused me have stopped harassing me, but they claim they didn’t know or realize how badly they were hurting me. We had a good relationship until I was outed to them as trans. If I had made physical wounds to represent the invisible ones they were causing me every day—maybe just maybe they would have stopped sooner. and maybe I wouldn’t be so fucked up, maybe I wouldn’t have so many memories that make it impossible to feel at peace. or maybe they wouldn’t have cared, but at least I could have gotten to a hospital, or maybe CPS would have considered giving a shit. After months of forcing me to sit down and listen, every day, to their vile rhetoric and insults of why I am a terrible, immature, dangerous person—for hours, unable to leave. every day without fail. and them isolating me—refusing to let me spend time with my friends anywhere outside of the house (and I didn’t want to subject anyone else to my house so I never spent time with anybody), taking my phone away or reading my texts or eavesdropping on my conversations and making me feel guilty for speaking badly about them (while I was trying to make sense of my daily reality) and trying to convince me I had bad friends because my friends would tell me that my parents’ behaviors were harmful/not normal. whenever I tried to tell them how they were making me feel they somehow turned the conversation into a failing of mine. they insisted they were being loving parents (and never stopped saying “I love you” even when they had bullied me to the point of repeated suicide attempts). the things they accused me of were not even rational, and because I have clinical anxiety and was already paranoid of irrational things, I either believed them or was extremely agitated by them. (for example, my mom implying to me that it would be my fault if my dad died in a car crash because he was driving distracted by the terrible news that I was queer—even though I was outed against my will. or that my grandparents would die if I came out to them). then the next day they would deny what they said or insist I interpreted them wrong even though there was no other logical implication to their words, and I remembered clearly..::
w
A few months before I turned 18 they started acting like normal people, stopped harassing me etc. even though they still refuse to call me my name. Now I self harm but there is no use—the damage is already done. there is no where I can go that their abuse will not follow me in my mind.  I still live with them. I don’t have anywhere else to go, I don’t have a license or a car or enough money to pay any rent or leave the city (where it is too expensive to live even once I get a job). but I can’t kill myself because I have a partner who relies on me (and if i’m honest I don’t want to leave him either) I just miss being at peace. I keep reading stories about trans kids who weren’t accepted and ran away. i wish that had been me. I don’t know what stopped me and I feel like a coward. now I am technically an adult and I could leave them forever, but it’s no use. the ptsd they gave me isn’t going to go away no matter where I am.

i’ve been in therapy for a long time and nothing really helps. Ive been on a million different combinations of meds. nothing can begin to take away the pain or the hopelessness I feel every day before I even wake up. i’m tired of living in constant pain. i’m stuck."
depression,"A lot has happened recently, need advice and direction Within the span of a few months, i lost my job due to covid and struggling to find another, my mom got diagnosed with cancer (and shes the person im closest to in the whole world) and ive struggled to find someone to be with (through a series of horrible online dating experiences, and my roommate can vouch that i was a good man to these women in an honest attempt to connect). I feel truly lost and now cry 3x days a week. I feel severe apathy and find it increasingly difficult to turn this around. My friends are all developing their own lives and families and no one has time to hear me out. I feel truly alone, how do i proceed, reasonably?"
depression,"Feeling sad. I've been having this sad, yet weird feeling since last year. I don't find fun activities fun anymore, I don't feel sad when I'm supposed to feel sad, I just feel emotionless. I feel empty inside ever since I moved here in Germany as a foreign student. I'm just repeating the same things everyday and not feeling the satisfaction I want. I go to school, eat, learn german, watch memes, and repeat it all over again. I tried getting a part-time job to keep myself busy and it isn't helping either. For those of you who felt the same back then, please give me some advice to be happy again."
depression,When will everything get better? I really don't understand anymore. I am tired and my self esteem had hit zero. Struggling to survive but I don't know what I can do anymore. Dealing everything alone and thought of finally finding someone but gone in a few weeks. I just hate how I feel and how I am being emotional unstable. I can only hide it from most people but it is suffocating. I don't even know when I have given up and maybe give up is the best choice here after all.
depression,"every night I think about killing myself Every morning I wake up and feel intense panic and all I can feel is my throat siezing up, and my heart beating really hard. Everyday, it feels like I'm screaming into the void about how lonely, and how much I need help, and hear nothing. Every night, I think about all the graphic ways I can kill myself. And even if it is hot and I am sweating to the summer heat, i feel cold and I feel like shaking because of how much I want a hug. That's what I feel every single day. I feel like thisnwhole post is extremely pathetic but I have no one to listen to me."
depression,"How do I find happiness in life? I hope it's okay for me to post here. I'm not really sure if I have depression or not, but mental illness/neurodivergence does definitely run in my family. My question is this, how can I be/feel happy and satisfied in my life? I'm not happy at all now, thinking on it, I have had very little times in my life where I was happy. I keep on wanting to go back to the past, and living in a time when I was happy. I don't want time to pass, and I feel like I'm just wasting my life away. When will I find my purpose, when will I feel that same happiness I once felt?? Sometimes, I wish I'd just cease to exist, and sometimes, I wish I could just sleep for a long time. I have been self harming as well again. I am not happy with my job either, and I miss my best friend a lot too. It all just sucks. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this post."
depression,"I Am Beyond Comprehension Recently went through psychosis because of the medication I was taking. I tried suicide twice in one week. I'm no longer in the meds and no longer psychotic that I can tell. There is a personal fear that it will come back.
I feel strange. I feel like nobody can understand me anymore. It's like this whole experience has separated me from everyone else. How could anyone else possibly understand? I have stood on the brink of oblivion. I am still alive because my knife was not sharp enough to go through skin. It feels weird. I feel weird. I don't know how to process this. I don't know what to think anymore. I am thoroughly confused. All I want is what I cannot have. Humanity no longer makes sense to me. How can everybody see me reaching out and collectively decide that noone will reach back? Is that just the one thing everybody agreed on? What am I to you people?"
depression,"my life at the moment I'm alone and I'm lonely weirdly I'm okay with it. I know Its my fault you know. I am a social butterfly extrovert who made so many wrong Decisions that it forced me to be this outcasted introverted nobody. 

Once was the guy that everyone wanted to know everyone would talk about me in a fun what a cool guy manner 
But not anymore 
I get it life changes and times move on 
But what confuses me is 
If I was so liked and had so many friends how come no of them stuck around or even act like they know me 

I've done terrible things but that is in the past just hope I could somehow reconnect with someone but hey consequences for your past choices right ? 

TLDR: past me messed up making me who is a extrovert be forced into a introverted lifestyle and lost everyone who I ever cared about and no one wants to know me."
depression,"This weekend I was ""paralysed"" from depression Hello all,

I wanted to throw out an very scary experience I had over this weekend.

for reference, my depression is from loneliness, I have anxiety and aspergers which makes it impossible to find a girlfriend, while I've got plenty of colleagues at work that say they care and ""miss"" me but no one ever talks to me outside of work, it sucks that I have to reach out every single time if I want to go out.

So after a failed suicide attempt by overdose about 2 months ago my mental health has been extremely low.

I really wanted to go to the London comic con, I invited all of my ""friends"" but no one could make it so I went alone, I already messed up immediately as I forgot I booked the wrong days for my hotel meaning I had no place to sleep for the first night which lead to an insanely stressful first day as I scrambled to find somewhere, eventually I found a room from airbnb which I have never used before.

nothing of note happened on day 2, I tried going to a bar as there was a party at the hotel i was staying at but I ended up just sitting there for an hour, just a lot of mixed emotions.

On day 3 I was extremely tired so I missed most of the comic cons panels as I went to sleep, eventually I went to a local shop to get some drinks and food, when I came back .... it happened ....

I started crying uncontrollably, I was suicidal, I kept wailing ""I can't do it anymore, I don't wanna be here anymore. some please save me"" over and over again, this happened for at least an hour.

after I calmed down I just couldn't move, I was sitting on the floor of my hotels bathroom and wanted to get up to get to my bed but couldn't physically move for at least 10 minutes, I eventually managed to crawl , yes I CRAWLED on the floor (also the plumbing didn't work in my room as well so my floor was kinda soggy after a shower I took in the morning) and again it took me like 10 minutes to get to my bed where I had to call the HUB and eventually an ambulance.

The usual happened afterwards, I visited a crisis team in London, they asked me questions, I answered blah blah blah .... eventually after being really tired I went back to my hotel and slept for a couple of hours until I got a lift home from my mum back home, Unfortunately my mum hates London and hates driving through as she just doesn't ""understand"" how the road works, this made her extremely stressed out and she took it all out on me, Instead of going home I asked to go to the Kettering UCAT crisis team which is my local crisis team ( I had an appointment made when I visited the London crisis team).

I'm going to be honest, The crisis team in Kettering were awful, I'm sorry I don't want to be mean but they were absolutely awful, they asked me a couple of questions gave me some leaflets and just sent me on my marry way! even though I was clearly distraught, I started crying uncontrollably again, couldn't move again and yet they kept telling me "" you need to leave we have another appointment"" I've never felt such ""carelessness"" from any mental health place I've been to before.

When I eventually came home I want to bed as I was still extremely tired ... I slept for 16 hours after that.

and thats it.

just for some clarification, I do have a private therapist which I find useful and I visit the local crisis mind cafe which I find most useful.

sorry for the long post"
depression,"Has going on medication helped anyone? So, I am unfortunately not diagnosed yet but i am desperate to be diagnosed (I am scared and I have no money to go) and I was just wondering if going on any sort of medication has actually helped anyone, and for those it has helped, has it helped with improving daily things in your job and in your relationships?

The whole situation for me is that I have struggled with spouts of severe depression (in my understanding, I am not diagnosed as i mentioned before). But I, in recent years have experience crippling downs to the point where i feel so numb that i am floating and my body feels like its vibrating. I have not been able to perform very well at my internship (devastating to say the least)  because of this and I wonder if going on medication would even help improve these things? Going to therapy helped, but it was only for a month... I didn't like the look at things in a ""positive"" way vibe though... but yeah

Any one medication has helped?"
depression,Ending a relationship when suffering from depression What's your view on ending long term relationship by someone suffering from depression? Shouldn't the therapist advice against it?
depression,"worst depresson of my life Hi everyone! Just leaving it here so that I can (mayB?) feel better after 

I haven't slept at all tonight. I have depression since Last fall, it comes and goes, tried therapy, medication, etc. and i never felt worse. I get so depressed that my stomac hurts and i feel like i'm going to puke or i cry so much that i have troubles breathing. I should feel great, considering what's happening in my life, i do have some success. Everytime something good happens to me i feel like i dont deserve. I really do feel that i have nobody in my life even tho i have a boyfriend and friends that love me. I am so ashamed of feeling this way and sucking everyone's energy. I try to do everything that is in my control even tho i have very low motivation (seing friends, doing yoga etc.) It helps a little but at the end of the day i still feel empty and i hate myself for pretty much anything. Does it ever get better? I feel like i'm out of tools. At what point could we just not recover from multiples traumas ? How do you hang in there when even tho, your personal life goes great, you see the world around you falling appart? I feel that it is dumb to even have some faith. There are a lot of mental illnesses in my family and I feel doomed because of it. Anyone feels similar to this? Dont be shy to share, it makes me feel less alone 🙂"
depression,"I feel like going to a corner of the world and die in a cubicle alone. Hello guys, a little about me.
I have a loving family , a group of decent friends who keep a check on me. I am a straight As student currently doing medicine and have taken a gap year due to deteriorating mental health.I am loved a lot. I have meaningful people in my life.I am witty and have always been the intelligent one in the group.People like me and I have no problem making new friends.I have no history of abuse or childhood trauma that can have a negative effect on me. My family are well off and money has never been the problem thank God.

Still after all this I feel like going to a corner and live in a dark cubicle without people.I dont have any passions or hobbies.I feel empty. I want to cry.I want to scream.I dont even know how to feel normal.I can put up an act that I am normal bus as soon as I listen to my brain it is F'ing me up.It feels like my brain is eating me from inside and there is no escape.It feels like I am trapped in my own brain and suffocating.I dont even know how to explain this.There is no rationality in this. I dont know. Anyone else?"
depression,"Overcoming the resistance to do things you should be doing/want to improve on? Ok so I have been playing music (piano and saxophone) and dancing my whole life and my dream would be to make a living out of it and be a professional musician and dancer, but as I’m getting older and closer to graduating college, I want to better myself more than I ever have, but there’s this really strong resistance to practice both of these and I don’t want this resistance anymore. It’s like my mind is telling me constantly “you should be practicing” “how are you supposed to get better?” and in a way I get discouraged and just can’t get myself to practice unless I really force myself to get up. I’ve struggled with this as long as I can remember, like I never practiced outside of classes and training before college, and i tend to lack motivation with other things such as making myself something to eat, laundry, dishes. I just wish I could get myself to be consistent, because I feel like I’m wasting my own time being lazy like this but it’s so difficult to get myself to do the work. Does anyone relate? And what do you do to combat it? I know the best answer would be to get up and do it no thinking but it doesn’t work for me all the time, because sometimes the resistance will get stronger once I start and I get frustrated with myself. It also worries me that I have this strong resistance because I couldn’t imagine not doing music and dance, but I have this strong resistance to do it? Ah I hate myself HA"
depression,"Struggling Everything is so god damn difficult. I’m pushing my family and my classmates away. I fon’t know what to do, I just wanna curl up.

I have to call my teacher because I’m about to fail her subject. I have a test today, which is the only school I have today, that I really don’t want to take. I also have a huge assignment that I haven’t even started on but is more important than the test and will determine my grade. I’m getting my final grade on Friday next week… I’m so stressed I don’t want this and executive dysfunction is making everything overwhelming and impossible.

I feel so uncomfortable with calling people. I would rather text but the test is in 2 hours so my time blindness is putting me into god damn waiting mode. I hate this.

Can literally hear my sister complain about me to my mom when I haven’t done anything??? Being Autistic sucks atm and I just wanna eraze myself from the timeline"
depression,"I wanna kill myself Ive been fine for a long time but i moved to Australia a couple years ago and since then its only been downhill. Im short, ugly (told so many times) and just hate life. My sister is smart and so is my brother, my parents have no faith in me and they dont even care about me anymore. All my friends are dating and I gotta deal with them talking about how good everything is whilst I sat there listening and thinking on ways I could kill myself. 

I dont need advice or help, I just needed to tell someone. Thanks to whoever reads this."
depression,"Finally started going out again and now I'm back in my cave I've been battling with depression for awhile now and I always have a hard time leaving the house and socializing. Every now and then i get the courage to go out and hang out with friends and family and usually things go great. But something always happens with someone and I'm sent back into a downward spiral.
I have this Uncle that I rarely see maybe once a year, we barely speak, when we do he makes me feel like complete shit. He would bring things from the past that people know I don't like to talk about and he says thing like ""I know you better then anyone else"" but like we've barely spoken in the past 15 years. I'm not the kid you use to know. And then the past weekend I had the courage to stand up for myself (cause I rarely do) I said ""You don't really know me and you don't know how I feel"" and he gets defensive saying I don't know what I'm talking about or I'm just overreacting. He made me feel like complete shit just for speaking up for myself. I literally was getting better and now I just don't want to leave my room and deal with people anymore. I've just sitting in a dark room and just trying to think what I did wrong even tho I don't think I did. I think I've given up on trying to understand people."
depression,"I think i am gonna die alone on this rate 
I am 23 years old and i never had a girlfriend i didn’t even hold hands i rarely text a girl clearly something is wrong with me i don’t know what i am doing that pushes girls away from me, i don’t think i am a bad person thats the issue but i think girls see me as a too nice shy boring guy"
depression,"Got bullied late in life and am having trouble accepting it I’m a 20M. I got bullied late in life due to a stunted social development. My parents divorced when I was 7 and my father instantly turned to alcoholism. He never stopped and we would always see him on the weekends. It put the idea of shame in my head early on due to him putting his alcoholism on public display. This made me an outcast in school and I was never included or excluded. I was just there. 

After I graduated, I went to college hoping to make friends. I got bullied for it very badly. I won’t go into detail but it was bad. I had been babied through life by my mom and never learned anything useful in being a productive member of society. It was deserved due to the fact that I was naive enough to apply to a college for friends. I eventually grew a backbone and bullied them back, but I had already lost. I joined a fraternity and tried to be cool which worked, but at the cost of my individuality. I had to get bullied in order to be normal. Being aggressive allowed people to forget the fact that I was once bullied, but I’m still broken. 

I cannot get over the initial abuse and move forward. I’m a good looking guy with some natural baseball talent, but this shit is killing me. I want to rise and become great. But every time I think about doing it, these people come into my head. Who gets bullied at 18? It’s really depressing for me and I cannot come to terms with it."
depression,"I don't live in my own home anymore I'm in my late 30s and never learned to drive. I had a job in the city right near my apartment, but I lost it in the pandemic. I got a job in the suburbs last fall, and I live at my parents house during the week and they take me to work while I'm learning to drive. Learning to drive is taking a lot longer than I thought, my friends told me they did it in two or three months, but I guess I suck. I apply for jobs in the city all the time and never hear anything back. I gained a lot of weight during the pandemic but I can't do anything about it here, I can't cook the healthy foods I want because my parents don't like them, and there's no room for my food and cooking supplies. I can't exercise because it's a tiny neighborhood surrounded by busy streets. My apartment is in a wonderful neighborhood that's great for biking. There's so many things I can't do anymore, my whole adult life has been taken away from me. I hate myself and I hate my life. I can't work on art after work because my desk and all my supplies are in my apartment. Nothing is set up here for me. My apartment is set up perfectly, everything is just how I like it. This is a horrible way for an adult to live. I can't date. I can't do anything but work and go home to a house I hate. I hit myself every day. I don't know when this will ever end. I don't want to keep living this way. I stopped hitting myself on the head because I read it was dangerous but the desire is so strong. I work at a medical billing company that specifically services mental health providers, almost all the therapists in the area. If I got a therapist my coworkers would know and some would see my intake paperwork. I don't like them and don't want them to know sensitive stuff about me. I just want to go home. I say that to myself in my head all day. I am only living just to live, my artistic gifts and contributions are wasted. If the universe doesn't want me to be an artist, or contribute anything beyond keeping myself alive, then what's the point? I don't want to be here."
depression,i dont know what to do anymore I signed up for a art course last month now i hate it and spend alot of money on materials. I spend my days watching YouTube. I dont study for my exams anymore. Idk what happened to me. I was never this muvh unmotivated. Help
depression,"My son is the only reason I won’t end my life I think about ending my life often. But my son is keeping me here. I can’t think of anything else in my life to live for.

My mum has Alzheimer’s and is deteriorating. Going to see her takes a part of my soul every time.
My dad is an estranged drunk who lives far away and I only see him very rarely, and when I do it’s brief.
My brother and I aren’t close. There’s no beef there, but we just don’t click.
I am adopted so I’m not bound by blood to these people.
I have friends. But they could move on with out me.
My marriage is hard. I will always have love for my husband. But we are so different.
My child is my love and light.
I truly believe that if he wasn’t here, I’d end my life.

That’s all."
depression,"I just want to cry, it’s all so terrible Life is so shit. Forced into a world we didn’t ask to be born in, forced to work or be homeless / considered a leech, negatively judging society + a depression/anxiety inducing existence; I wish it would all end. Unfortunately I can’t leave this world, I have my own moral obligation to take care of my sister when the rest of my family dies, it’s not a burden I wanted or asked for. I wouldn’t mind if humanity went extinct. For years now I’ve had the daily thought of wishing everything would end. Nothing gets better, I have no hope left, days start meshing together and it’s just a perpetual waiting game for death to come. Life is meaningless, humanity is garbage. At this point all that’s left to do is cry and wait in anguish. Anyone else hate it here?"
depression,"I don’t feel seen I just feel very ignored by humanity. I have no real evidence for this other than what I feel but still. I just feel very invisible. The world has made it its mission to tell me that I do not belong, ever since I was young and it’s starting to really get to me. I wish I belonged. I wish I could relate. I wish I had a part in the collective human experience but i don’t. I don’t belong. I’m invisible. I’m worthless to most. No one would look twice at me and think anything about me. Whenever I tell people this they hit me with empty platitudes and try to gaslight me into doubting WHAT I EXPERIENCE. Which makes me feel even more invisible.

Never have I ever belonged. Never have I ever been wanted. Never have people tried to make me feel included. Never has anyone helped me understand why.

I’m invisible and I don’t belong."
depression,"the only way out of debt is death I'm writing this because I woke up an hour before my alarm and I can't stop panicking and crying. I fall asleep with tears and I wake with tears. The anxiety is constant and never leaves. 

I'm trying so hard to get a job but absolutely no-one wants me to work for them. I cannot believe I haven't found ANYTHING. It's been a YEAR. I used to be successful and independent. I worked full time and I was good at my job. Every bill was paid in full on time. I used to have an 800 credit score. I had a great reputation as a hard worker. And then I broke. I literally fucking fell apart physically and mentally and I lost everything. Everything.

I feel like I can't even go into detail. I feel like I can't even tell my story without placing the blame on someone else's shoulders. Which is pointless, because this is my fault this happened. This is my fault. I never took care of myself and I never even realized I wasn't. Its like I couldn't even see what was happening until a few weeks ago. I woke up and I was in this hole seven miles deep and if nothing changes soon, there is no way I'll climb out in my life time, even thought that is all I want to do. If I  could get a job, I wouldn't buy myself a single fucking thing. I'd eat plain bread for every meal if it meant I could have income coming in and be able to pay my bills.

More than anything I wish I could talk to my therapist but I cannot afford it, and therapy is why I'm in so much debt. I continued therapy while I was jobless and just... racked up that debt. It helped so much. For the first time in my life, things made sense and I felt like a valid human being.

But it came at such a steep cost.

Please, please, please universe. Please. I just want to work. I just want a job. At this point I am trapped into this corner and there's literally only one solution and I can't get a grip on it. I would literally give up everything I own for a chance."
depression,"Being this way is keeping me this way. I (42) just don't want to feel like this anymore. I've struggled with my depression since I was a teenager.  Watching my mom suffer and pass away is around the time it really started. I couldn't cope with life. I was alone, had no family and went down a very destructive, dark path. I'm no longer on that path but the only part of that life that continues to this day is my depression. I want to be normal. I want to be one of those people that get dressed in the morning, go to work, go out and do things I enjoy and actually enjoy doing them. I do have joy in my life, 3 awesome kids who I love with all my heart., I'm a SAHM and do for my children all that they need and then some. But inside I'm miserable. My youngest started school this year and that was supposed to my time to get independent and leave my abusive (mostly emotional and verbal) marriage of 13 years. But I'm so depressed that I can't even get out there and take those steps towards happiness. I've felt for a very long time that leaving this marriage would help me. But my depression keeps me right where I'm at. It keeps me from doing things I know would help me. I'm so sick of this seemingly never ending cycle. I know I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for my kids. I attempted suicide a couple times, long before I became a mom. One time after being in a coma for 47 days, even the doctors called it a miracle that I pulled through. That should've been to be free from feeling this way. How am I ever going to get there?"
depression,"Is distraction a good coping mechanism? When I feel too much desparate, like i want to scream out my pain and fall down in tears, when I want to hurt myself, i distract myself with different other things like my studies ( which is essential ofc) , music or games... These days i have been playing games a lot due to these ""Distractions"" and i think I am getting addicted a bit

Is this method efficient or not?"
depression,"When is it too much I've slept 4 hours total and I wake up crying. The person I love doesn't want me anymore and idk how to handle it. I've been through breakups that hurt but I was able to mentally get over them but this one, this one is one I can't fathom. As I lay in bed and think about what life will be after it's all said and done is not a life I want to enjoy. It is not the path I want to walk after thinking the path I was in will take me to my Version on a perfect future. I don't know what I'm going to do with this unbearable weight on my chest and this pit of lava in my stomach but it's almost too much for me to contain. Someone help me get through the most unbearable thing I've ever experienced!"
depression,"I'm a burden to my family  Depression and anxiety has crippled my ability to do anything. 


I wish I didn't exist"
depression,I hate this I hate feeling like this I was so motivated and hopeful and doing well. but feel like shit and it comes out of nowhere and grabs me and keeps me down for ages no matter how hard I try to fight. I’m exhausted. So exhausted I just wanna fade away from everything atm but I know I can’t and that’s what’s killing me
depression,"Everyday Everyday I wake up and quickly remember everything that’s wrong. Sometimes I remember to make a list of the good things in life but honestly I just hope this is my last day. Everyday I wake up and hope it’s my last day breathing. I hope I’m in the right place at the right time and something or someone takes my life from my body. Even if that someone is me. I hate being alive. Being alive just makes me want to die. So many people die every day. In this city. But somehow I’ve escaped death everyday of my life even though I’ve longed for it for as long as I can remember. I hate what it means to be alive, I hate everything it entails. The good will never outweigh the bad. If you see this make a wish for me to get what I want today."
depression,"A Resentment of Who I Am Let's just jump right into it: I feel like a worthless failure, undeserving of the good I have and deserving of bad I would always be intolerant of anyway. The descriptor I seem to have settled on for myself is ""lazy asshole"" on the basis that I objectively do not provide for myself, yet I don't feel ""connected""/close enough to anyone to even grieve their deaths (should it happen), much less ""open up"" about myself, despite them obviously caring enough to enable my continued existence.

----

I often feel so absolutely alone since what I *have* seen on ""what depression feels like"" never quite fits; at best, I fixate on some incorrect or inapplicable detail and (ab)use it to say that the entire thing is inapplicable, while at worst it genuinely doesn't apply. I'm not even ""casually"" suicidal; I just don't see any reason to hope for the future.

Of course, I still have some vague hopes about the future. With a sole exception, I treat them much the same way I treat a desire for magical powers - which is to say that I see them as impossible and unrealistic - but they still exist. As a silver lining, that means I have few hopes to quash anymore; I let go of or forgot all my aspirations anyway, so I am left with only the objective failures, such as failing to provide for myself.

For what it's worth, that sole exception is the hope for a future life-partner. It's slowly being killed by all *sorts* of ""fun"" things I'm finding out about myself. It's actually a ""hope"" that I *want* to be quashed, since perhaps then I'd be able to tolerate feeling so alone on the basis that there is no realistic alternative.

----

I (passively) hate who I am. My *body* and my *life* are fine - I, my mind, is the problem, and yet there is no ""easy fix"" to that. And my mind is still definitely my problem; it's *my fault* that I've been this lazy. The problem even extends to those ""good days"" I may have - as I'm still a lazy asshole on those days, it just doesn't bother me.

It's lead to the most recent resurgence of uncertainty that I even have depression, or that it's deserved if I do. After all, is it really depression if I actually am that lazy? Or do I deserve it for being responsible *and at fault* for my own poor mental health? I don't blame anyone else for my own incompetence; it isn't like I had a traumatic childhood. I wasn't neglected nor was I spoiled; I *had* friends at one point, and seem to still retain passable social ability. It's all down to the fact that I took the path of least resistance; it's all *my fault* that I'm friendless and feel alone, and so I hate my mind; I resent how my mind seems to work.

It'd be *so easy* to solve, on paper: just tell my parents, who I still live with. But if I *don't think I'd cry at their deaths*, then why would I feel close enough to ""open up"" to them? It's a risk to ""open up"" as such, and it's a topic I've not felt any true encouragement to talk about from my family in all my time being alive, so it still feels ""taboo"" to do, much like discussing parental love lives. Some topics simply aren't brought up, and personal mental health is one of them."
depression,"I LOOK LIKE A MONSTER I've been experiencing depression lately I think this is because of my face filled with acne. I feel down most of the time, staring at something, and suddenly crying. When I go outside anxiety kicks in, that's why I always stay inside our house missing the fun of living my teenage life (I'm 19 years old). I once visited a dermatologist, and sadly the treatment cost fortune for someone who is not rich like me. I don't want burden my mom with my problem that is why I didn't go with the treatment. Everyday feels like hell for me. I've been thinking of ending my life a lot times now, everyday I wish that God would take my life ang give it to someone who want's to live. Maybe I'll just try living in my next life. If you are reading up to this point, thankyou for reading my depressing story."
depression,"I'm not miserable anymore, it's just boring nowadays I've tried to write a paragraph on how it used to suck but things didn't get better but I stopped trying or caring. I've stopped because what even is the point in that.

depression,world is too dark I want to be happy but i think the world is too dark
depression,"oh god i wasted the past half year doing absolutely nothing with my life. im not normal ill never be normal what the fuck is wrong with me? i just want to be normal i just want to live like everyone else i dont want to be this way anymore. I dont recognize who i am. i look in the mirror and i have no idea who i see. i dont feel like theres a ""me"" in this world. i think im losing it. i just want to go back to the way things were before i got like this. i was supposed to graduate i was supposed to live a normal life. now im broken and ill always be scarred. time never goes in reverse. i think i already died a long time ago"
depression,"I feel like this is what's meant for me. I've never felt like I'm worth it. In any sense. Ever since I was a kid I've felt disconnected from it all, and like I'm in the wrong place. The wrong reality. I don't really even mean that in a traditional ""loner"" sense; I've always been fairly popular, or at least not unpopular, and can interact with people in general just fine. I'm constantly out of the house, socialising and doing things. But I've never felt deserving of love or any meaningful companionship, so anything even remotely resembling a relationship has been fleeting, and I constantly wonder why my friends bother to stick around. I feel like my family love me just because they have to. I don't feel like I'm supposed to make it. I'm not meant to succeed, or be happy. That's just not my path. I've never felt motivated, or capable of doing things like others can. And at this point, at 26, I don't see the point in starting. This is how I've always felt and how my life has always been, so why bother now? I've missed out on so much that my life just feels like a write off. Like a crumpled up sheet of paper, that isn't worth taking out of the bin. This emptiness feels so familiar that I can't see myself without it. And I don't even want to leave it, because that means I could have left it this entire time. It means I could have been happy all along. Which in my mind, makes me more of a failure than I already am. It's a truth I can't stand to face. Part of me does want to get help but I've always either been turned away by doctors or not been given the help that's right for me. It's been beyond discouraging. I've tried CBT but couldn't do it, because I could never concentrate. Counsellors have just told me to be kinder to myself, like I'm supposed to just switch these feelings off, and that my mindset is a choice. It's not; at this point it's who I am. I can't imagine a version of myself that isn't like this. I think I've got undiagnosed ADHD and OCD, but I have no idea how to go about getting a diagnosis, let alone treatment. Same for my more obvious anxiety and depression. It just feels so much easier to not bother with anything and to just gradually fade away. To die alone once everybody who could potentially miss me is already gone. It feels like that's what's meant for me."

depression,"I am on the verge of losing absolute hope I have been fighting depression since the age of around 15. It's going to be almost 7 yrs since of the upcoming 22nd birthday. Which I absolutely don't look forward too due to many reasons

The thing is that it keep coming back and it doesn't matter what I do. It always comes back

I have changed my whole life 180° for the better. Literally, I go the gym multiple times a week, have abs and a nice muscular toned physique. Follow up with a diet, sleep well, do house chores, managed to take on a job in a iron castings factory lifting extremely heavy. I EVEN quit smoking, drinking, drugs porn completely

SO WHY THE FUCK IS LIFR SO UNFAIR TO ME. I'm so pissed and sad about this. I literally do everything possible to better my mental health, physical health and future and this shit keeps coming back

It makes me just feel like giving it all up, why even try and be sober when you do every single thing possible to be better and it gets better for some time just to fall to rock bottom out of nowhere for extended time

I've been in rehabs, psych wards, took meds, been to therapy. Nothing helps and it wasn't like a short try kind of thing, I tried it for years and no success. What has been helping the most was my current lifestyle without meds and fucking up my neuronal structure any more

So, literally what's the fucking point in being better and sober when you see and do everything to be better and it still gets way worse then back when using"
depression,i'm not getting any better Everything makes me want to hurt myself. I have no one to vent to. My mom is a single mom and i know that seeking professional help is out of my options. I just want to take anti depressants or anything to stop this. I just need prescription or idk. I am so lost rn
depression,"I want his scars The other day I noticed scars on my coworker’s arms. I’ve been working with him for over a year and literally never noticed before. 

I’m drawn to them. They’re in such straight precise lines. I NEED to know why he’s done this to himself. It’s all I’ve been thinking about for days. 

He’s literally such a strong asset to the team at work. He’s super good at what he does and he’s dependable and works hard and everybody loves and appreciates him. 

And then there are the scars. 

I want to know if he’s ok. I want to grab his arms and take a solid look at them and make sure he’s ok now. I don’t even know if they’re recent or not because I haven’t gotten a very good look. I’m so worried and I just want the best for him in his life. 

On the other hand, those scars are so hot to me. I want them. I want to feel the pain again. It’s so fucking messed up and I feel terrible saying it. But it’s the truth. 

He seems so solid and impenetrable but he’s got these scars of vulnerability covering his arms. Going deep into his skin.  And fuck that’s hot to me. 

I’m so messed up."
depression,"Motivation's been hurt I went to school for animation, intending to one day get into the industry (of course) and was considered an exemplary student in the program. Unfortunately, after graduation, I entered a depression/ADHD slump that I've been stuck in ever since (just about 6 years). A couple weeks ago, I read Creativity Inc. by Ed Catmull and suddenly felt a surge of motivation. I started pushing harder to get treatment, I started drawing in a daily doodle book again, I collected tutorials to start watching and following.

The depression slowly started to creep back in and my momentum started to slow but I got a real jab yesterday. I remembered there was a big wage-fixing scandal in the animation industry a few years ago and wondered how much Ed Catmull was involved only to find out he was one of the main heads behind the scandal. ""Is Creativity Inc bullshit? Is Pixar's creativity-valuing culture a lie? Is it still like that, despite Catmull's retirement?""

Thing is, I recognize that, these days especially, anyone can be revealed to be a POS. Even if Pixar is rotten there are still other animation studios. Yet, why did this revelation hurt my motivation so much? Why is part of me questioning if the animation industry is even worth the trouble of fighting out of this slump?"
depression,"im the worst kid ever Yesterday was the worst day of my life. I’m such a disappointment but I feel like I cant only blame myself for it. I don’t have any real friends and I don’t take my friendships seriously because I don’t feel like there’s anyone around me who is rlly my person. I wish I had someone to talk to. Idk what to do anymore the only thing gives me vision of my future is school. I don’t know why I feel like this. I have a family, great home, money, and my parents get me practically anything I want but still I betray them. Im so guilty and ashamed of myself. I’m young and have my whole life ahead of me and I feel like I’m ruining everything already for no reason 
How do I move on from this I’m so close to giving up."
depression,Funny People Are you the funny one in your friends group? I guess a lot of us tend to mask or cope with depression through humor. Just curious if it’s common amongst us sad bastards.
depression,"Losing myself I'm 17M, and I've been dealing with depression for most of my life, however it's been recently that I've become more addicted to drugs and other instant gratifications to distract me and even then it's not working, I am dying mentally and I don't know when I'll reach out for help or even if I deserve that help. I don't feel human, I have no desires, dreams, hopes. I live the same day everyday with no direction or goal. I've been losing more weight from not eating but at this point I've stopped giving a fuck. No one cares about me or gives a shit that I let myself come to this point. I'm too scared to actually kill myself but I can't stop thinking of just wanting to not exist as I only live to serve as a burden to the people around me. I literally have no social life and it just feels like there has been zero progression throughout my life as a person, physically and mentally. Am I fucked? Is it too late to reach out for help? Do I just actually kill myself? I'm starting to just not care and fall deeper into this fucking hole. I would rather fantasize about living than to actually go out and live. I am feeling useless and hopeless right now, but I just really wanted to vent and get it out."
depression,"i hurt someone i love tldr; 5 year relationship about to end because of my depression

how do people handle a relationship with depression? i (f20) had it for many years and it just worsened in the past few years from betrayal and trauma. I find myself lashing out at my so (m21) over small things. Instead of saying that i feel neglected recently, i hold it all in till i finally explode. Of course i noticed after so long and tried to speak up when i feel that way. But my so just wants me to be more considerate of how tired he is from work and im still a student.

He tends to stonewall and avoid communication when we quarrel and its like the worst thing for someone with depression and anxiety. I would prefer to talk it out but he just doesn’t want to or takes a week to talk and only when i reach out to him. I know that its not right but I am also at fault for constantly lashing out though i also feel that when i bring it up normally i often get dismissed.

So do let me know, if you have been in a rs and suffer from mental illness. How did you cope? I want to know how you manage your anger/ outbursts, especially when you forget to take medication."
depression,"Getting back onto a normal sleep schedule really improved my mood and stress levels. Small success story. I'm a morning person. I love my coffee and quiet mornings. But stress and depression made me start staying up really late, to the point I'd go to sleep at 6am sometimes. 

However last night I went to sleep earlier and I woke up at 8am today. I'm a bit groggy but my mood is a lot better and I have an appetite again. It feels like I have so much more time and I actually have motivation and energy to do things."
depression,Embarrassed about having depressive episodes How much can one person talk to their friends and family about one topic and not end up sounding like a broken machine. I can practically hear their thoughts saying yes we know you are depressed what else is new? Well if you already know then stop fucking asking me to talk. Fuck you
depression,"I'm (23m) so sick and tired of people I apologise in advance if this post is off topic, but I don't consider myself to suffer from depression as a mentall illness, however I feel lonely and desperate from time to time, even when I'm around people, I don't think I have even one true friend who would be there for me no matter what, and who doesn't see me as someone who can be used.

I am (and was) surrounded by so many toxic people, mostly my narcissistic brother and mom, my toxic ex girlfriend(s), my toxic ex best friend, and all the other people to whom I opened myself, but they hurt me. I also have so much shit going on in my life sometimes I just think I should be gone from this world. I hate this world for what it has become, that most people aren't talkative at all, that noone wants to have relationships with each other, that people only want to use other people for their sake.

I only need one true friend or partner, I'd give them all of my attention and love and would want that in return."
depression,"how to cope with self-harm thoughts I've been struggling with depressive disorder for over a year now and since I'm on medication my condition got way better. However there are still some days/weeks when I feel down and sometimes my self-harm thoughts recur. Thankfully, I haven't had any suicidal thought for about half a year now but recently my mood worsen and I started getting self-harm thoughts which are scaring and exhausting to me. Whenever I have them I involuntary think about sharp objects and my wrists start physically pulsating. I then just sit or lay in bed just waiting for thoughts to disappear because I'm scared that otherwise I'm gonna harm myself. Please, can someone give me any advice how to cope with self-harm thoughts? Thanks."

depression,"It’s hard to be sad and a Christian So I have been feeling emotionally exhausted and completely hopeless and sad for the last few months and I don’t know if I can deal with these feelings for many reasons…

I have all the symptoms for depression but I hate it when people assume that they have it for attention so I just put myself down and say it will pass over but it hasn’t and only gotten worse..

Also I am a Christian and I have no doubt in my faith, but being depressed can be looked down upon and make you seem like a “bad Christian “ because you aren’t completely happy in the Lord’s presence and should be perfectly fine and happy because you got God. 

These expectations of a Christian make me want to puke or just die so that these expectations won’t make life harder than it has to be.

I just need advice to see if I’m talking crazy about what is expected or whatever, I mostly just wanted to vent.. thanks for reading my useless struggles."
depression,"My thoughts are killing me College life has been really hitting me hard, I'm in my 3rd year in and I failed several courses and probably i'm having to go for more 4 years if I keep doing like this.

My thoughts are really affecting me during college, I have a lot of social anxiety and have really bad time connecting with people. I think its due to a very low self-steem that has been accumulating for several years.

When I was a kid I was very happy and extroverted, and made a lot of friends, some of them are my best friends till this day. I was diagnosed with ADHD very early in life, I was that ""devil kid"" that every parent told their kids to stay away, but that faded away, but my head continued to be explosive, I can't stop thinking for one second, I create scenarios in my head all day long, my teachers have to draw my attention by saying my name because I daydream very ofter. Anyways, when I hit my 10s I got really addicted to food and videogames, I stopped caring for school, started getting bad grades, stop carring about making new friends in the real world, I pretty much destroyed my teenager life. So people wouldn't talk to me, cause I was that internet troll kid that stinks lol, when I reached 16 I weighed 308 lbs, and I am 5'6, so you could imagine a Mike Wazouski look alike walking arround. I decided by myself to get a gastric sleeve surgery, and I did it, when I was in the middle of my 16's. I lost 154 lbs, and I feel way better (a lot physically and a bit mentally), I try to go to the gym everyday and it has been like this since I was cleared to got to the gym after my gastric surgery. I'm still very short (somewhere 5'6\~5'7) and where I live (Brazil) most women despise short men, Big Ls, but still sometimes people say I'm atractive, even though I can't accept it at all.

I somehow managed to go out on a date with a school friend, from my fat and douchebag internet kid days, I even bullyed her in the past, and it went pretty pretty well. I took her on a car trip and we talked for hours, and then we went for my house where things happened, she was taller than me and for me she was a 10/10, and that was the only time lol, it was VERY confusing for me cause that was the first time that I ""connected"" with a girl at this level, days after that event she started posting about that day, in a good way, making indirect tweets about it and I felt like I could ask her out on a second time. I asked her to come to a house party I was helding and she came, we stayed together for a long time, then she grabbed my arm and put it on her neck when we were watching movies with our friends, I was like damn ok, after our friends left the room I asked her for a kiss and she said no, it was very very confusing at the time. After that I just stopped attempting anything and after 2 months of that she reatached with her ex '-', another Big L. since then I never managed to connect enough with a girl to ask her on a date, that was in 2020. But even with a sort of ""confirmation"" that I can get with a pretty girl, everytime when a girl talks to me thoughts in my head start appearing, like, ""yeah thats probably another friend u gonna have"", ""you waayy to short for her lil bro, get going"", I hate it. Even when they are clearly hitting on me I manage to get socially awkward and kinda dumb and girls tend to lose interest lol.

I don't have a problem talking with people I already know but I keep talking too much and sometimes I regret things I say, remembering what I say for weeks, or even years, and feeling like an idiot.

Because I failed some courses I ended up in a class of people 2 years younger my age, and I feel like shit cause I see how all of them are way better socially and still can get better grades than me. Another Big L that I had recently that really affected my mentals too was fucking crypto. Yeah, I know, NOT a good a idea. I lost a very very substantial amount of money, enough to pay my bills for 2 years, that was some money that I had from investing in a good stock strategy, where I was managing to have a 4% a month on avg, and some money from my parents that they trusted me to invest. I got so excited with crypto that I decided to go all in, thinking that I was going to get rich by 2023 and trusting that ""predictions"" work. That was a very idiotic thing to do and another big L, with the money my parents borrowed me I could've followed the same strategy and reached financial freedom from passive income at 20 years of age, but I was naive and dumb.

I got so fucked up during a 40% crash that happened during the night that for some days after it, I started losing weight and not having enough sleep, I started abusing weed and I had a psychotic break that lasted for 4 days, during that time I thought I was the rebirth of Caligulas and I was destined to have the same fate as him, not literally (he died in a boat that he created, full of drugs, parties and prostitutes, he was lustful, and his boat sank killing a lot of people). I thought his life was a metaphore of mine, that with my illusion of wanting to get rich with crypto and getting other people to invest in it too was going to ""kill"" me, the boat sinking meaning the money I lost, and the parties, drugs and prostitues what I was imagining I would get if I got rich with it... I know, pretty dumb. I thought that we were living in a simulation of names, where every person with the same name was the same person (in terms of personality) and our world was a simulation to see what happened to those people if they were different from one another, and in different locations, also thought that my parents were the Devil and God, pretty fucked up, I felt like I was very high on acid. All those Ls keep knocking on my head pretty much everyday and I feel worthless. I find my self living in a automatic mode where I just want to get home and watch youtube videos and smoke weed, and don't even bother with college stuff, today I received the news that I have to get a grade 9/10 in 4 different disciplins in college to make this semester. I'm in the exact same situation I was 2 years ago when I said that I was going to change, but I simply don't change, but I have to keep trying.

Anyways, sorry for the long text, just wanted to give a insight of my story. not that anyone cares... I'm in a bad place mentally this days, but I still hope for the best. Any tips or guidances? I'm really needing it."
depression,"Day in and day out, almost no one contacts me or calls me. I look at my phone, nothing and nobody It's so frustrating to feel alone but also feel like there isn't anything I can do about it. It's not like I can go to the store and buy friendship, I can't make people want my presence or friendship. And every time I look at my phone I think ""Oh look, it's nothing and nobody again! Jeez nothing and nobody will you please stop blowing up my phone? All day every day, it's just getting ridiculous""  


I'm totally aware that this is self-victimizing, but the reality, is that it really gets to me. It feels like a dead end and I start to feel a loss of breath, I assume what I experience is an acute version of a panic attack. I want to just scream tears of anger, and endless frustration that my life has convened into such a lonely and desolate place. The truth is that I think of suicide and I often prefer to be dead, but I would never actually go through with it because I couldn't hurt my family that way.

I wish my social and romantic situation was like other parts of life where I could more easily control the situation, but it's far from it. I've been trying, for a long time. I'm not getting results. I meet new people, I make new connections and rekindle old ones, and I swear to god I am not down and depressed during those interactions I swear I'm fine, and not negative, but still, they don't initiate back with me often if at all, and rekindled flames just go out as fast as they were rekindled, after a lot of work to get them to rekindle. It's discouraging and it's a pattern.

Thanks for listening to me and I hope you are having a better week, my heart goes out to you and all of us here."
depression,Fave meal when youre depressed? Mines tomato soup and toast its perfect and I can stomach it
depression,"I feel my depression eating away at me every day, and yet I feel guilty for it I’m incredibly depressed every day, and have been for the past 3 weeks, but I hide it and make sure nobody sees anything is wrong, but I feel guilty, I shouldn’t feel this way, one because people have it so much worse than me, and two, it’s for what I deem a petty reason, it’s over the love I have for someone, I just don’t know what to do, every day my thoughts get worse and worse, but I don’t know if I can stop it, it’s constantly eating away at me, what do I do?"
depression,"Months later and I still can’t stop brooding over instances were I was mistreated. Was I even in the right? How do I stop overthinking about it? Was In the wrong? Last year I went to see this beautiful street with my mother and brother. It was in a more secluded neighborhood, and it was lined with deciduous trees. In one side of the street there were empty lots with a lot of trees, and on the other huge lots with tall walls and houses way back, the street ended in a cul de sac.We would park, walk around in silence while taking photos, then back to the car, repeat. First a dog from one house started barking loudly, and he was quickly joined by his owner, an old and angry looking man that kept staring at us while calling someone with his phone. 

We were on our way back to our car when the gates to another house were open, and a man asked us what did we wanted there. My mother was angry and without replying directly to him just said loudly to herself “they think they bought the whole street!”. To which he said they didn’t, and kept staring us down until we got inside our car. Then he closed the gates, and this extremely loud alarm was blasting, warning against intruders. We went to a public street to take photos, we didn’t mad any noise and were not bothering anyone, yet we were treated like trash.

Earlier this year another thing happened. I was out with my family and stumbled upon this cool artsy place that had art galleries, cafes, clothing stores and restaurants all in one place. We walked in and only a few minutes in a man came up to us and very arrogantly said we couldn’t use cameras to photograph inside, only smartphones due some rule they have. As always my mother leaves me to be the bad guy and turned to me asking if I wanted to check out the space still, I was angry and while the guy was still taking I said “No, I think I’d rather leave.” The guy the started mocking me loudly, saying “that’s right, you can do that!” And then as we walked out of the space he told my mother how sorry he felt that I couldn’t understand the rules. Once I got home I found out that man is one the owners of the place, which is often hailed in the local media as a welcoming and cool place to go.

 These were the two most recent events, but there’s another one that keeps playing in my mind from when I was just 19 and walking to work. I was walking through the open area of a complex of three office buildings and snapping photos with my phone. A security guard approached me and said I couldn’t take photos there, so I just accepted and walked over your very public sidewalk. I took one final photo from there, to which the guard made a ‘come on’ gesture. I feel so wronged, like these things keep happening to me even though I am almost invisible. I have social anxiety so I am extremely quiet and never bother anyone. Yet people treat me like shit. I barely leave the house, and when I do this happens.

Every now and then I’ll remember these incidents and can’t stop thinking about it. To go out to photograph was one of my few pleasures in life. But now just thinking about going somewhere with my camera makes me feel chest pain. Yet the people who caused me pain most likely don’t even remember me, the guy from the big house is there in his mansion, the owner of the gallery has everyone gushing over his inviting and friendly business. 

It’s 4 am and I cant stop agonizing over this."
depression,need to talk Um I dont do this normally nor do i know what im doing but i just need to someone to talk to that wont judge how fucked up I may be.
depression,"Law school graduate depression I (28M) graduated from top level Law school in Czech republic (Europe) and have been working for the municipal office. Basically helping citizens with legal issues, who cannon afford it. It was technically a paralegal job, but I was master of my own time. It was 3 year only fixed job. The job was great and the coworkers were one of my best friends. 

Later I was 6 month uneployed and I enjoeyd it, travelled a lot enjoyed my free time etc. I have also a great supportive girlfriend. My first plan was to try for a trainee for public prosecutor, but test was build on memorizing and I failed. It was almost impossible to find a new job as I didnt have any backup plan.     

Now a friend of my mother, who is a lawyer got me an position in real estate business, where I am working as paralegal. The thing is I am working here for two month and I found out, I fuckin hate it and I dont want to do law. People here are so toxic and expecting me to know everything about their business in which, they are for 20years.  

I am really depressed, because the school was so f\*\*\*\*n hard and none of my friends was actually able to do the bar exam, which is like super super hard. Because you have to memorize everything and I am bad at it.  

I have feeling, that I wasted my years and I have nothing to look in the future, dont know my career path. Worst is that my parents and my girlfriend are pushing me in the good way to stay in job I hate and try the bar exam. I am not able to explain to them, that I am not that good lawyer and I cant make it. The pressure to not let them down is killing me as they always tell me what can you do besides law. Why did you study it? I dont now and its fueling my depression. 

Every morning I wake up with the feeling, that I should just pack my backpack and go tramping in the world, so I will not bother everyone. Every morning train ride I just want to sleep and miss my work destination. Sometimes I am thinking about killing myself, because I have no future besides being a slave in the work I hate so I can eat and survive as some kind of animal. But I am coward to actually do it. 

I am feeling so lost, which is so strange to me, because I was always able to resolve problems. Thanks to anyone, who was able to read the whole thing. Have a nice day."
depression,"i’m fine, but i’m not. honestly, i don’t really know how to use this app &amp; this is probably really stupid, but i’m just trying to find anyone to relate to/ talk to or really just need to put this somewhere to vent. 
my life was so happy so recently. i was living close to family, had an amazing job, was living with my boyfriend, i had a dream life. i was working out everyday, eating healthy, loving life.
all in the span of a couple of days, i got cheated on, lost my job, had to move all the way across the country, i feel like i’m dying &amp; idk how to live anymore."
depression,Therapy online (betterhelp) yes or no Is it good or has it been tried
depression,"Nothing changes. I moved to a new house, got on new medication, am slowly catching up in school, healed the relationship with my mother, and am meeting up with friends more often. But I’m still not happy. And I can’t let myself get better because I know I’ll spiral again. I can’t be happy because I know it’ll end. I can get close to people because I know they’ll end up hating me. I fucking hate myself. And it’s never gonna change, because I’ve never known any better. There’s never even been a point in time in which I was content. There’s no past me in which I wasn’t sad. I was sexually assaulted at 9 I was neglected by my mother and verbally abused my father all my goddamn life I struggled with a self harm addiction when I was 12 and my first attempt was at 13. I have everything I want, I have a family again, I have friends again. But I just can’t shake how much I despise my every action. My very being is wretched to me. I broke down the last time someone complemented me because I couldn’t possibly believe that someone could feel positively about me. People ask me what I wanna do when I’m older and I literally can’t think of anything because I can’t imagine having to live with myself that long. I have put up a facade that I’m better now, that I conquered self harm and that I’m in a much better place now for two years but the reality all this time has been that I’m slowly sinking. And the worst part is even if I wanted to get better the system doesn’t give a shit about you. I’ve thought about admitting myself but all the mental hospitals are so goddamn awful where I live that I know it would be a waste of fucking money and time. The world is so fucking “advocating” for mental illness until you’re at your wits end and can’t take care of yourself. Fuck the system. Life is absolutely meaningless. They’ll only give a shit about you if yourself healthy, but school and the system and everyone else will wright you off as a freak. If anyone has had a positive experience as a teen in a mental hospital please let me know. And please share your negative experiences too. I just want honesty"
depression,I'm losing hope in my gf's recovery help me please We're in a LDR and hasn't been long since we got close. Now she's going through a hard depression wave and i can't do anything to help her. I feel terrible for not being able to help and it's making me feel so so bad it's making me wanna cry and die. I can't watch her suffer and live with my life
depression,"Useless degree forced by sexist parents is ruining my entire life 
I wanted to study medicine or stem but parents didn’t allow me study any of them because they wanted me to be a housewife, not a career woman. I had to study a useless degree they chose for me because they’d refuse to pay the tuition otherwise. After I graduated I earn minimum wage just as they planned. I want to reset my life but I don’t see how. I can’t apply to any stem master program nor afford another bachelor degree. I don’t see any other option than suicide. Maybe I can get the right parents and study the right major in the next life."
depression,"i feel so depressed and i dont know the reason i cant stop comparing my life to people my age in tv shows, which i know is stupid. but it makes me feel so depressed. i was really good for a couple of weeks - social, productive and happy but this weekend has ruined me. im meant to be revising for my gcses but i dont have the motivation, i tried reaching out to a friend and they literally left me on read. this is the same person who tells me ""you can always talk to me!""
somehow i feel i deserve all of this, which makes it worse. i just want to run away and leave everyone."
depression,I’m done Once again I’m suicidal. I’m so frustrated with my situation right now and I want everything to stop and I want to cut but everywhere I normally cut is still healing. I want time to speed up and for school to be over but I need time to slow down because there isn’t enough of it for me to take a breath. I want to be done.
depression,"I know life is worth living but I just don’t want to I’ve been in this constant state of not wanting to live for a while now. I work my ass off in a job that leaves me more depressed after every shift, I earn money that I don’t want to save for the future because I just don’t want one. I’m constantly burning myself out with work to eat time out of my time at home doing nothing but feeling shit for myself.

I feel pathetic because I know so many people have it far worse in life than me but despite knowing that I still just feel dead inside and want it to end.

I’m too afraid to end it myself because I couldn’t do that to the people who I know love me. I also can’t bare to think of if I failed and put myself in a worse place than I’m already in mentally. 

I’m not really looking for anything by posting this, I think I’m just looking for a place to vent my lack of motivation to live."
depression,"Could this be depression? I’m trying to figure out if I possibly have depression. It feels difficult to bring this up to my doctor. 

I do not feel sad, like I’m worthless, like my family is better off without me, or suicidal. 

I do feel a lack of motivation and a lack of interest in anything at all that isn’t just lying in bed on my phone. I am often tired during the day and while I don’t have trouble falling asleep in the night, I do have troubles staying asleep and am often awake from 2-4am or so. 

I work from home, get groceries, do laundry, prepare food for my family and that’s about it. Then I wake up and do it all over again the next day. I’d rather be in bed on my phone than spend time with my kids. I don’t really have the energy for anything else. (I am fairly healthy and do not take any medications.)

I know this isn’t normal, but wonder about the depression possibility since I don’t really feel sad. 

Any thoughts or advice I’d appreciated."

Currently in bed with piles of clothes that need sorting and I have no energy whatsoever. Smiling is a chore. Everything is a chore. I don't think my partner notices. I tend to cry in the shower. A lot.

depression,"What the fuck!? What the fuck am i supposed to do?

I'm 29 and i have no direction in life... I have an ok job, great friends and a gf who loves me. 

So for about 3 years now i went on sick leave for about 2 years for my depression and anxiety. Highly  suicidal and pretty much and empty shell.... But then i started to feel better, mostly cuz i got kinda bored sitting at home and alot of help from my therapists. I stopped going to her about a year ago, but now im starting to think i should have continued...

I started to think about my future, so i recently took up some studying that i needed to get a better job. But about a month after I started i just got super anxious cuz I just felt whats the point? I'm not gonna succeed and most definitely not gonna find a better/dreamjob. I should probably get some help again, start with my medication.... Been fucking depressed since my teen years. Can you ever be happy?"
depression,"Why doesn't she want me? I'm hurt She had been my best friend for over 10 years. Sooner or later I caught feelings. She obviously thinks I'm super amazing and really handsome. So I confessed. And she doesn't feel the same. We were close. So close. I thought I was really really special but I don't feel it at all. It's been hurting me. Why was I never an option? Of all people to ever be rejected by, why did it have to be the one true person I've made a long, deep bond with that has been through everything? Why isn't my affection and love enough? Why am I not good looking enough? I never wanted a relationship with anyone my entire life. I've been single and happy and she was my only exception and I feel so empty and lost that I'm not that special enough. I've got nothing left. It took years to build myself up and now I'm back down to rock bottom. I'm not special. I'm invisible. And I'm drowning."
depression,"Maybe I should just make peace with loneliness My ex broke up with me 6 months ago and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through.

Since than I got over her and I thought I finally headed somewhere stable until I dated that girl a few weeks when she decided to end it yesterday. It was the last straw. 

I’m such a loser. I’m not good at making friends, i’m not good at relationships with others. Everyone talk about their love and sex life but for god sake I haven’t slept with anyone since my ex! And it feels impossible to find a poor ONS.

I crave for a relationship but I guess that’s not for me and I have to make peace with it. I’m getting attached and hurt way too easily, my breaking point is so low and I feel emotionally exhausted.

Maybe it’s for the best being lonely.
This life are so rough from many aspects.. i’m not suicidal but sometimes I wonder if it was best for me not to be born. That making babies is selfish.
I try to be good and I put so much effort with things just to fail each time and see how easily it comes to others. How I struggle emotionally and financially"
depression,"Depressed 13 year old??? please read So the title says it, I'm 13 (female)and I'm feeling always down every day, I'm always bitter and terrible to my family,I resent my parents for being poor and choosing to have kids with this type of lifestyle they have idk,i just feel really really suicidal right now because of my life recently I've been searching ways to end my life painlessly but i know I don't have the guts to do it,my parents always pressure me about school and my social life saying that i need to go out and make friends with my age but i can't because i have social anxiety and im a boring loser , I'm feeling really really insecure about myself too,i always feel jealous whenever i see someone pretty my age,i think to myself ""why don't i look like that? I'm the same age as her but I'm ugly as hell""also i don't believe that much in God because if God really does love me then why do i live this way? why can't i have a normal life? normal parents,friends,and etc.Also idk if I'm hormonal or just depressed,tbh i think I'm depressed because i already stopped puberty and already developed plus I always feel angry, envious and bitter whenever i see someone my age successful like idk why i am like this I started being like this when i was just 11 also i feel happy most days but everyday when I'm alone with myself i just feel like this,also i made a diary to let out all my feelings but sadly my mom found it (i wrote about how i was suicidal,that I don't believe in God anymore,etc) and she yelled at me and told me that i was the reason she had cancer, because i don't believe in god anymore that i am the cause of our family's misfortunes,So i know that i am just a terrible person,i became the person that i hated, the bitter resentful girl....sorry for my long post i just had to get this off me"
depression,"My Blue Thoughts I have been numb for so long I hardly ever feel emotions besides hopelessness, sadness and loneliness, and when I do get happy it reminds me that this is just temporary, something will fuck this up and it will go away. This has a major side effect, my feelings get bottled up and I can't express them. I can't cry, I can't release my emotions. They either get released on other people making me toxic or myself, still toxic.

I always had a connection with Linkin Park's songs. I realized that these songs make me feel less numb, and in the end it makes me feel somewhere i belong. Like a paper cut it makes me feel and pull out all the feelings crawling under my skin. It helps me focus at times and leave out all the rest, and at times perfectly describing how heavy I feel.

Chester's death was a red light for me, it meant sometimes depression wins, it takes over so much that the only escape left is to end it all. His voice helps me sooth myself, lets me feel my emotions, makes me less numb, I wish I could be something like that for someone as well. I hope I can find meaning for my presence in this fucked up world, help someone, help myself. For now I am unmotivated, directionless, spent, exhausted.

I see people my age doing stuff, being happy, being alive, motivated, being loved; I am jealous of them, I want that too. I hope someday I get it.

Sorry"
depression,"I am just so tired. My life was completely different in high school. I was social, happy, etc. Now I live alone and isolate myself most of the time. I go to work, come home, and repeat. I hang out with friends occasionally, but usually when I do, I just spend the whole time wishing I was back home, which makes me feel guilty because I do love my friends and enjoy spending time with them. My apartment is a disaster but I’m so overwhelmed by it that I just don’t clean it, which makes me feel gross. My hygiene is also suffering, which makes me feel like garbage because it’s so simple to just shower and brush your teeth. Any time i’m in a social situation I go home and replay everything I said in my head and think about how stupid and embarrassing I sound. Being in this cycle of despising myself and feeling like I have nothing to offer is so exhausting. I have no energy, and on the weekends I spend most of my time in bed. I know that it’s not normal for a 20y/o to be exhausted by just getting up and doing the dishes, to the point that sometimes I have to go take a nap afterwards. I don’t know if it’s because I smoke weed or because of the depression. I look at everyone around me going out and having fun and not being completely exhausted, and I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like I have nothing to offer. ugh, sorry. rant over."
depression,"Am I alone? A month ago I got fired from this part time job I got, one of my coworkers cussed me out and stood up for myself, long story short I got fired for that.

depression,"My (36M) girlfriend (31F) doesn't want to live together anymore I've been in a very deep depression lately. It's been compounded by the fact that I never get to see my girlfriend anymore except once a week because our new work schedules are so incompatible.

Tonight she told me that she doesn't want to live together anymore. We're in a longterm housesitting situation right now, but once our friends return home, she wants to find separate apartments. She still wants to date, and still loves me, but feels like she can't grow without having a space of her own because she's never had one. She went from home, to roommates or prior partners, to living with me. So, she's never been on her own.

Before living with her I was always alone or living with roommates who I wasn't on a friendship level with. And, I hadn't had a girlfriend since High School. So, I was lonely in a lot of ways. And, that was thr biggest contribution to my depression in those days.

I feel devastated. I feel hollow and hurt and I'm realizing all the things we can't do if we don't live together. And, how much less time we'll have when we already have so little. I don't want to be alone again.

I respect her wishes and I understand why she feels she needs this. But, I'm scared."
depression,"everything is so messed up Hi, I’m your average college student who, to be honest, lives a life with nothing to complain about.
But there have been past traumatic experiences and things that seem to hold me back and weigh me down, from the constant expectations from my family and friends.
My whole life I’ve felt neglected. I play myself off to seem goofy, but I’m really hurting inside when everyone seems to write me off as a joke, including my own family.
No one feels safe enough to talk about my real feelings.
I feel like no one cares about how I’m doing, but rather how successful I am in school, and will end up being in life.
I’m hurting inside, and have been for a very long time.
It’s gotten to the point where not even my friends can comfort me to even feel something.
I push myself everyday to achieve things, but I always come to ask myself if I’m really doing it for me or my parents. I very often burn myself out doing it.
The constant emotional battle that I deal with has just become a part of me, I feel helpless.
Death seems so soothing at many times, no more worries about school, work, money, no more having to constantly please my friends and family.
But I can never end up doing it, because I feel that it is selfish to those around me. How pathetic, right?
This is only one layer of my thoughts, I could probably go on for a lot longer about my life but I’m just gonna end it here.
I hope this gets lost in the feed, I hope I’m forgotten."
depression,"19F I feel like giving up Im pretty useless tbh. I have no license, no job, i have like no special skills at all. I can't afford to go to a college(not even a community college) or get a therapist. I sit around my house all day cause i feel like i physically cant leave without having panic attacks. I have no friends hardly(i actually just got ghosted by a good friend a few days ago). There are barely any times now when i actually feel happy. 

I have hella bad depression/chronic anxiety. It sucks a lot. I can barely even keep up with my hygiene. I see family and people i know my age doing sooo much better then me and it makes me feel absolutely terrible. Ik im still young but i feel like i need to be doing something with my life. I live in a small ass town and its difficult finding jobs. I don't even got anything going for me look wise either. Ive been told plenty of times im ugly af or some other dumb insult. So i dont even like showing my face to anyone. 

Ive been trying to find hobbies i could try but i have no patience or the desire to sit there and learn how to do something. I mean ive tried lots of things tho and spent weeks practicing and see like no difference. I just know my life probably isnt going to go anywhere and its just gonna get way worse. And once again, ik im still pretty young but that doesnt change how i feel. Ik people can take years to figure out what they wanna do but i dont wanna do that. I like knowing what to do, and how to do it."
depression,Feeling sad and hopeless Someone close to me has a neurological disorder. There are no current cures. It's heartbreaking to me and makes me so sad. They may begin to degenerate and idk how to deal with it. They are close to me and I just can't deal with it. Maybe i'll decide to leave when they do too. Goodbye. ;;
depression,"I want to die but I can't. I am the ""you don't know until you know"" person. 

Everyone always tells me how ""happy"" I am. How ""strong"" I have become with what i have been through. How well I'm doing. How they wish they had my confidence. How they wish that they could have the my positivity. I'm the go to when someone needs help or a shoulder to cry on because I have the right things to say.

They don't know I've just got really good at faking it.

Truth is, I am struggling so bad. I can't sleep. I have no motivation to eat. I have no energy. I am so fucking sad. Everything feels so heavy on me. Everything feels like it's crumbling around me and I can't fix it. Nothing I do feels like enough. I haven't been able to make friends in years and I try so hard to but something just isn't clicking for anyone to stick around. I act like it doesn't hurt to have no friends but it does. It hurts so fucking bad. I have my family and my partner and I love them, but even there I feel like the least valuable person. I have always felt like I'm not enough for anyone. I've never been enough.

I have wanted to die for years. More that half my life I have wanted to die. I had unsuccessful attempts when I was younger and was hospitalized a few times. I saw what it did to my family. That they were hurting. I didn't want to hurt them. 

So I ""got better"".

Now I suffer silently and smile. I can't tell them how bad I'm really doing. How I'm worse than I've ever been. I can't afford to be hospitalized and I can't afford therapy. I can't hurt them again. So I stay quiet. I can't talk to them because I can't stand the idea of them being worried. I can't talk to anyone because there isn't anyone else.

And I can't die.

But I want to so bad.

And I dont want to want to die anymore.

I'm so fucking tired."
depression,"I didn't ask for this life I've been going through a hard time , my parents are not rich but they sure as hell are arrogant and demanding . I am my mother's first husband's son and and she is married again to another man and my stepfather's family hates me , my aunt said that she would never even let me step foot into her house and trust me i would not even want to step foot into that bitch's house .

My mom would constantly hit me when i was young , by the end of the beating session the belt buckle would be broken and my skin would be bleeding and now after growing up i think she did it because she heard all the negative things people would say about me and she channel her anger by beating the crap out of me .

 i think i got some mental health issue because of all the abuse i received and when i tell my parents about it , they tell me it's because i can't control my body .

I finished my vfx course and have been constantly looking for job and my parents keep cursing me because their relatives keeps asking them what i'm doing and they get ashamed to tell them i'm unemployed so they get furious at me and tell me to do whatever possible to get a job .

My parent's relatives never call me  but they do call my parents to ask what i'm doing ...strange .

I'm not rich , i never had a decent childhood , i  got some kind of mental health issue from all the beating i received on my head , i keep getting pressurized by my parents to get a job as if i'm not trying hard enough and my relatives never ask how i am but what i'm doing as if asking if i'm alive or dead .

it's not that i'm not ambitious , i use to be once but then reality happened to me and i realized if your not financially rich and not academically bright than you might as well be dead .

I never asked for this life than why am i forced to live this life ? i wish we had laws where we could request for painless death , at this point the thought of dying seems more comforting than living and people who say otherwise have no idea what people like me are going through ."
depression,Hating yourself no matter how good things are really turns people off. Stupid fucking shit Feels like I have the best support network behind me but instead of anything positive they're all saying do a flip. Metaphor. No one supports me
depression,"Dump Is anyone willing to talk to me while I dump all my shit, on snap or reddit?"
depression,"I'm sucking a guy's penis for 20 dollars so that i can buy drugs i'm so digusted with myself. We meet every wednesday and he just fucking abuses me. I'm a guy, i'm not gay i just do it for money. Everytime i come home i want to kill myself. I'm on antidepressants but they don't do anything. I'm so disgusting. I'm sorry. Thanks for listening to my rant."
depression,Talking to partner about suicidal thoughts I hate talking to people but people always say you should tell people when you feel this way but when you don’t actually commit people call you manipulative and I can see both sides and I don’t want to be like that but I feel like that means I’m not allowed to tell anymore or else I’m guilting them into supporting me and checking up on me and it just makes me feel worse how can I do this the right way?
depression,"Friends told me im depressed. So ive been steuggling with my gender identity recently and this weekend i was at a private party with friends who know. We talked about my feelings and such and depression was mentioned. And i claimed that i do not have depression. I thought about it and also did some research but i came to the conclusion that everything i read was way worse that anything I was experiencing. But according to my friends I'm depressed. So now im even more confused then I already was.
How do I find out if I'm affected?"
depression,"I'm struggling with uni Currently a sad and confused first year uni student in engineering that is struggling with uni. I feel like there are a multitude of reasons as to why:

Feeling homesick as it is first time I live without parents. I remembered having a breakdown one week into uni and travelled back home to stay for the weekend

For the first month I never had any contact with anyone in my course. Remembered feeling sad as I struggled with homework. Luckily joined a gc so I always feel connected with them online

Online/blended learning makes me bored and disengaged with my work. I feel like I'm behind in classes and the only way I'm still fine is pm members of my gc to help me with the answers

Concerns about my future made me reconsider if engineering is right for me. This was so bad that it made me consider to switching to another course. So I reapplied again to uni whilst and put my studies to the side. But then I got rejected multiple times, and have a breakdown that lasts a few days. Now I realised that had I picked the other major I may have the same sentiment- I am indecisive and unsure about my future

I now think that I will continue, but I'm worried that my mental health will get the better of me. I'm worried that I will get even more depressed and drop out, leading o a waste of time and money and disappointing my parents. I have felt like this since January and am worried I can't sort this out"
depression,My therapist I have been seeing for 3 years told me she doesnt have the tools to help me and I need to find a new therapist. Why am I up fucked up man

depression,Does it get any better? It's been weeks and I still feel hurt...  betrayed... lonely... I hate feeling like this and I want things to get better but I feel like my trust has already been ruined.
depression,"i need help. i have 0 motivation at all right now. a person i knew for 3 years and almost dated for 5 months just told me everything was a lie and they never loved me all because of a dude shes been talking to for a week, i have basically no friends, i feel like im a total disappointment to my own family, the only thing i can do is sit on my phone or sleep, i can barely eat. im 14, i know i sound like your average teen but this shit is getting tougher by the day and at this point suicide just seems the easiest way out for me"
depression,"any success stories of overcoming no emotion? what did you do? how long did it last

i've been experiencing this for 6 months now  and wanted to know if it's temporary

i'm on 10 mg abilify and 25mg agomelatine (it was there before the meds)"
depression,"I'm once again falling into deep depression and will unalive myself, cause nobody will help me My family continues to betray me, my so called friends are a bunch of idiots, I tried reaching out so so so SOOOO many times, and nobody cares. I'm freaking 30 years old in 2 days and I'll off myself on my birthday. I can't live like that anymore dirt poor with parents who can help me start my business, but nooooo why would they do that, they prefer to watch me suffer, I may off them too before myself. I hate everyone and everything in this world, you are all sick monsters who value money over human life. Like what the actual fuck, are you for real humans, do you really call yourself intelligent and conscious and whatnot. You are braindead apes, I hope AI decimates you all. Bye."
depression,"My thoughts. I can’t describe what this is? Is it my anxiety or I’m depressed? Background of me:
Im 22, work full time 5 days a week 10 hours a day, full time uni student. This how I’m feeling, I wrote this and I’m not sure what is happening with my feelings. I used to be very extroverted before 2020 COVID 19 and the lockdowns began, ever since after coming out of this 2 year shit show this me now:

Earlier in the day my mum pointed out that I could be going through a depressions and this what I wrote a few hours later: 


So I think you were right when you were speaking about a possible depression. I am never happy when I come home. Always telling my parents how they are failures. Do not want to go anywhere, associate with people, talk to people or go and catch up. Do not want to attend anything at the mosque. Do not wanna go on dinner with my own family, haven’t gone to dinner with them for months. I stopped playing PlayStation, stopped playing sports, stopped going gym. Some days I feel like doing all of the above but more times I don’t wanna do anything. 

Any help is appreciated it. I can’t describe this all and get my surrounding of people to understand my situation."
depression,"scared of being seen as overbearing I have a friend who’s been going through a depressive episode lately. He’s been isolating himself and not eating — the usual things that come with these episodes. 

I’ve been checking in on him everyday (reassuring him that a reply isn’t needed; I understand it completely. I just don’t want him to feel alone) but I’m scared that by checking in and asking him if he’s eaten everyday is going to make him feel burdened by it. 

I give him the space he needs and I don’t send him a lot of texts — just one or two a day but I’m scared that even that is too much. 

Should I stop the daily texts and just check up on him every few days instead?"
depression,"the shame of being seen I have a few people in my life albeit we talk about things deeper than the weather. There's no way at least a couple of them wouldn't have noticed me distancing myself, not taking care of my hygiene, and me making stupid mistakes in my life. I can't hide it anymore. I'll soon have to reveal that I won't graduate because I was a lazy ass and didn't do enough. I hate that they can see me fail. I don't want to open up to them yet they can still quietly watch me rot. And because they won't say anything I will never know what they think of it. I didn't agree to this. It feels so one-sided.

In a weird way I feel like I wouldn't be so suicidal if I was invisible to others. The only person who could see me fail would be me. I wish I could just disappear."
depression,"Things would be better if I pretend to be ok I'll no longer be a burden to anybody. I'll no longer cause problems for people. I won't be exhausting and overwhelming. I should just suck it up and pretend. Sure bottling things up would do me no good, but that's better than being someone who can't stop talking about their thoughts and feelings eventually becoming a burden. I'm pretty sure everyone is tired of me. They have problems of their own and I'm just adding up to it."
depression,"I am scared of the future now! I read a post on this community about a person of my gender and a little older than me suffering from depression. I am scared that my life will be the same. I wish that person well but i'm scared that what if my life turns out to be the same way as them?   


What if i end up miserable and there is no happy ending as they show in movies. What if i keep day dreaming and the people around me grow up and i am left behind as a burden to my loved ones. I am afraid to love or even like people. I get tired of keeping friendships and i get scared of being alone. I am really bad at expressing my emotions so i don't know what to do with them. I have things going on i want to type but i don't know how and what. I'm just tired and scared and anxious."
depression,Someone please help Im shaking. I dont know what to do I cant take this any more
depression,"How can I just not feel anything I wish there was a magic pill

I wouldn’t care what it does

As long as I feel nothing

I don’t want to feel anything anymore"
depression,I almost made the jump. idk what stopped me. but life has been so bad recently. i cant stand this life but i’m still here.
depression,I’m not sure Why do I feel like my only reason for living is to make people laugh?
depression,"I'm depressed but then not. I've been diagnosed by my gp that I have depression and is scheduled for therapy in 3 months. (They have long wait times). I'm not sure if anyone else experiences it but one day/week I am full of joy, happiness and eager to do anything and can do anything. Then suddenly I have no energy, no motivation and no joy in life. I opened up to my parents and they support me dearly but it only seems to work during the convo and then it comes back again. 

Any suggestions what to do?

I used to love to play games and cooking but now I don't find fulfillment in doing any."
depression,"It’s Lonely at the Bottom People never want to reach deep down into the mess that is depression. Nobody wants to be friends with a depressed person. I’m finding…the more numb I feel, the less contact with others I enjoy. 

The only one who can help me is myself."
depression,"I feel incapable of love. Is it depression or is it just who I am? I’m 23 and I think I’ve never truly loved anyone before. I feel infatuated and attracted to people sometimes (mostly for the sake of intimacy and usually with a fantasised image of who they are), I care to help people including my family, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt true love towards anyone."
depression,"I feel nothing anymore. You know that overwhelming feeling of just feeling so shit your body goes numb? I've been feeling so down lately I hardly have tears left to cry and there's nothing I can think of to make me feel better so I'm just sat in the fetal position on the couch wondering what to do with myself. I don't have the energy for self harm, and everytime I feel like downing a bottle of pills I think of my parents and then I can't bring myself to do it. I'm in a different country with no family and hardly any friends. All I've got is my partner and we've been arguing so much lately I feel like I don't even have him as support. I feel so alone...my dog of 12 years passed away a few months ago and I felt like she was my only family and rock whilst living in a foreign country. And now I don't even have that. We have another dog and even though I love her to bits she's not the same. I feel so alone and just don't know what to do anymore. There's nothing that can pull me out of this funk. I jusy feel mentally exhausted all of the time and I'm done with it. Whilst I wouldn't kill myself I do wish I would just die by some freak accident or something. And when I long for that I get so upset at the the thought of hurting my family that I just start sobbing uncontrollably. I'm just wondering if it'll ever end. I'm so tired of feeling like shit all the time."
depression,"Tunnels. When many people get trapped in a tunnel, they look for a way out. They'll search endlessly for the light, sometimes to noavail, and sometimes escaping. For me at this point, I find myself so often trapped in tunnels, that I feel more comfortable here than I do on the surface. I'd rather just stay here than risk falling again, it just hurts too much."
depression,"I got a second chance and I think I still flubbed it. 
Way back when, I quit engineering school  because I hated it. I cried myself to sleep back then hating my choice. Fortunately, my parents were very understanding when I told them about my situation and that I wanted out. They told me to choose a career path that I thought would best suit me. I chose culinary arts because I loved cooking and back then I thought ""This is it, this is what I want"".

I liked culinary school. The place I went to wasn't the greatest college but hey, at least I was doing what I liked. I even got a scholarship by a private company because I was doing really well. They offered to pay my tuition in exchange for working at their company's one restaurant branch for 2 years. At the time, I thought this was an amazing opportunity. I didn't have to look for a job post-graduation. I get 2 years of experience at work. Everything seemed fine and dandy until I graduated.

Fast forward to recently, after a few hiccups due to COVID, I finally start work. It was insanely taxing on my body. Came home after work and my body was sore as hell. Work was nothing like I had imagined but at the time, I thought ""Hey, it'll get better"". A few more days of work pass by and my body is just not having it. I felt like I was gonna die from exhaustion. I got a fever and my spine and lower half of my body was just destroyed.

During that fever, I had a mental breakdown. I suddenly had terrible thoughts of self harm and I kept crying and crying, thinking ""I fucked up, I chose wrong again."" I felt like I had no way out this time. I get physically better the next day but my mind was just out of it. I called off working that day just to try to get into a better state of mind. It didn't happen. I still think I fucked up on my choice. I liked cooking but not the restaurant business. I am now stuck with a 2 year contract that I regret taking and now I feel so lost as to what to do. There's just suddenly this overwhelming feeling of sadness that I just can't shake off. I get thoughts occasionally of just ending it all.

After a few more mental breakdowns, I get back to work and thought, ""Maybe it will get better this time"". Nope, my mind was so checked out and I just wanted to bash my head on a counter. The sadness was still there. I just hated myself for choosing this path.

I feel useless. I was given a second chance and I still fucked it up. It's my fault I didn't think things through. It's my fault that I chose this. I don't want to be a burden to everyone I know and that's the only thing that keeping me slightly sane right now. I don't want to do anything right now. I just want to melt away and hope everyone just forgets about me and move on with their lives."
depression,"Pls help me I hate school but not for the reason you think. I feel alone in school, And sad even tho I have freinds but I’ve recently lost some freinds and I could make all of them laugh which made me happy because I feel like my only reason for living is to make people laugh but I can’t anymore. And now I feel like I should just die. What do y’all think?"
depression,"Sigh. I know I don’t have a right to feel this way. I’ve got a fiancée, good grades, financially stable, and yet I think this way. At some point, I felt like I’m mediocre at everything that I’m not a good partner neither a good daughter. 

It’s just hard that I have to keep on trying to make this life worthwhile. There are a lot of people who expect me to keep up the good work. 

I’ve been crying for two days already. I’m just tired and just want to rest peacefully, but I can’t. I have to try and fight life. 

PS. I’m not gonna reply."
depression,"Why do I miss the past? I have a friend who I used be extremely close to, I would facetime him almost every single night, and we would talk for hours about how much our lives sucked. Just vent to each other about shit that's happened. Then we started to get better, and moved on from each other. Now we only talk once every 1-2 weeks and it's a short conversation. So my question is, my life was royally fucked back then
(and still kinda is), so why do I miss it?"
depression,"Everyday I feel like I´ve been run over by a train For pretty much 10 years. I don´´´'t know what I do wrong. I eat vegetables, I sleep, I´´´'m not on drugs. Constant fatigue, feeling old, feeling stiff. I'm 31 now. Had everything checked. Fuck this shit"
depression,"Failed in life,trying to turn it around I am in my late 30s, haven't worked since my mid 20s. Never went to college or learned a trade. On disability for asperger. I am alone a lot,I don't date because I can't provide. I recently joined a job agency that deals with disability to try get myself back to work. I am nearly 40, I feel like a failure sometimes."

depression,"I just can't take it anymore. I am done Hi everyone, I am done, I just can't take the pain anymore.

I am a fresh graduate from India who became the breadwinner for the family since the age of 16.

I work 2 jobs, that is 18 hours a day.

I give up on everything now. That is all to my life. Work Work Work.

My girlfriend of 4 years left me because of my work, my father had always been toxic to me, I have been working so hard just to hear I made him proud. All he says is ""You have given nothing to me except pain""

What more I can do for people around me to love me for me?

I worked for my family still they say I have given them only pain. Even after working so much, I called my girlfriend every single day. I tried to talk to her everytime I was free. Only thing I was doing except work was talking to her and yet she broke up saying ""you became distant because of your work, I do not have feelings for you anymore""

What else can I do for these 2 people I love the most to love me back.

This is not the first time I am opening about it.

I have tried therapy, sports, travel everything. Nothing works. Everything sucks.

Please don't tell me life matters and all that crap.

 EVERYTHING IS FUCKED

If you understand how much I have given up please suggest some suicide ways that will make it seem like an accident. 2 reasons, my mother won't be guilty that I committed suicide and my insurance will pay for my family for atleast next 10 years.

Thanks in advance.
Please no sympathy."
depression,"living a boring life So where do I even begin with
In 19 and i do nothing 
Literally nothing, no job, no college.
The most i do is household chores other than that I'm useless. I have a feeling that i do not matter much to anyone.

depression,"Single, Sad and Hopeless Hello, whoever is reading this. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for years and it has gotten worse. I have been single for almost two years now and cannot find a man to talk to me. I would love to get to know people but my crippling social anxiety makes it impossible to go out and meet people. I cry myself to sleep way too much, can barely handle going to my job and doing day to day activities. Anyone else understand this?"
depression,college so yesterday was national commitment day in the us and i committed to my state school. this from the start was my last choice but ended up being my only choice because of money and distance but i can’t help but wonder if i had actually put time into thinking out my future that i wouldn’t be here. for reference i’ve been on 300mg of wellbutrin xl for almost six months. i feel foggy 24/7 and i don’t remember much and i never saw my life going this far. i just feel hopeless. i don’t want to go to this school. and i’m watching everyone around me be happy with their choices and i feel like i’m the only one in my school who doesn’t have all my shit put together.
depression,"Fucking Idiot. I left my work bag at my job over the weekend and I can't find it anywhere. I asked everybody from flooring to management. Why am I so fucking stupid? I had all my work stuff in there along with my sketch books, art supplies and waterbottle. I fucking hate everything."
depression,"What happens after you reach out for mental heath support? TW for self harm and related topics. We've all heard teachers and doctors and mental health experts say that if you or someone you know is dealing with
mental health issues, that you should seek help. The problem is no one gives me a straight answer as to what happens after that. 
I (18NB) have been struggling with anxiety, depression, and recently diagnosed autism for a long time now which has led me to self harm and some pretty intense suicidal thoughts in the past. Because of that I spoke to my school counsellor when I was still in HS, signed myself up for therapy, got referred to a psychiatrist and am now taking medication for my anxiety after a
very long journey. But since then I've moved to a different state for uni and am beginning to feel a regression into my previous thoughts and compulsions. What would happen to me if I told a
doctor or counsellor that I wanted to hurt myself? Would anything even happen? I feel like none of them actually care enough to do anything and just make me talk for hours so they can get paid and send me on my way."
depression,"I think I've gone to the point of no return I've grown up in a pretty much damaged home. Parents always arguing. Being poor. My parents didn't get their own house until I was like 15 so most of my childhood was cramped into one room with my brothers and sisters. No social life my parents were strict and never let me out. When I turned 18 my dad sold me lies about how he would put me aboard with his company and hire me on (he does otr trucking) after 2 years of waiting I asked him why it was taking so long and he just told me to get a job. I couldn't hold one for that year because of lack of transportation. With the help of stimulus checks I flipped a few motorcycles and got a car , enrolled into job corps for electrical work n even got a gf. After I learned everything they told me they'd hold me so I left early which was a mistake I got a license on my on n downhill everything went. My car that was being used while I was at school broke down . I have no money to get it towed, my gf lives in a different state no way she's going to be able to take the distance especially with my inability to see her. My car is still at the parking lot i went for an interview. I can't even sell my soul to the military because I have bad knees. At this point idk what I can do. They say it gets better but I don't know . Life has consistently got worse the more I have lived it. And if it ever gets better it's just to show you how good it can but never will actually be. Just to give you a taste of what you could have but indefinitely won't have . The weird thing is my parents were Christians hard-core but I don't understand if my parents were such good Christian followers why God would allow so much suffering my dad had a terrible childhood and so did my mom. They grew up to struggle 90 percent of their life. I don't know what to do. I used to really think and ponder on suicide but now I don't exactly want to die. I feel like it's so unfair I have to die to feel relief instead of just life finally clicking for me like it does for everybody else. If life were a game I would want to restart maybe, or just turn the damn thing off . Idk how I became such a fuck up and I really don't know what to do"
depression,"I dont want to do anything anymore I literally turn 19 in a week, and everything has started to crash down .

I dont get why I have no motivation for anything 

Games I used to enjoy just bore me after a few minutes

I cant seem to do anything without it just boring me after a bit

My yt channel (58k subs) i no longer care about posting anymore, it was my only source of income. 

I am supposed to start college this fall

Still haven't even shown up for the school tour

I avoid everything for my future

I am so anxious and have nobody to talk to

when I think of my problems I figure that they're not worth being upset over and that sets me off even more down a negative spiral

I really just think there's something fucking wrong with me"
depression,"Please help me find a good cocktail with lithium. Hi. I have severe depression, anhedonia, crippling anxiety, lack of motivation, terrible mood swings, maladaptive daydreaming, intrusive thoughts , chronic boredom.  I am taking SSRIs almost a year and they don't help at all. I still want to end my life and every morning I feel guilty for waking up. My doctor suggested Lithium for my mood swings and suicidal thoughts . But I don't think it will be enough. I want to attack my depression from all sides. I want to take different meds for every symptom. I am really tried. I want to feel some changes. 

Meds I was on: Prozac, Paxil, Duloxetine , Wellbutrin , Trintellix , Topiramate , Depakote ,  Abilify , Lamictal ,  Seroquel , Buspirone.

I need to antipsychotic for my psychotic episodes and to stop maladaptive daydreaming and intrusive thoughts. (  I was thinking about Geodon)

Antidepressant that will work best for by anhedonia and depression.  (Maybe Amitriptyline?)

Psychostimulant for lack of  motivation.

An they all should work with lithium without killing me. Please give me your best coctktail. Thank You in advance!"
depression,"oh golly i done did it again! i’m failing half of my college classes and my grades are beginning to slip for the other half. i thought i could do it but i messed it up again lol. now i’m on lvl 2 academic probation and i don’t have the will or energy to fix it. i feel so worthless. i hardly even know why i’m going to school. to get an education and not be leeching off my parents forever? because i was raised to believe my entire worth is directly tied to my academic standing?

i don’t know. i want to cry and i don’t want to wake up tomorrow."
depression,"agoraphobia Anyone else have this? I've been going through a huge depressive episode these past few months and I swear my agoraphobia has come back. Just the idea of leaving my house and interacting with a bunch of people whether that be strangers or people I know literally moves me to tears.

My psychiatrist has said that this is fine (for me, at least) and it's already pretty good that I can go out if I really need to, like for a doctor's appointment. But the idea of a huge family gathering that'll probably last for hours gives me this painful feeling in my chest and makes it hard for me to breathe."
depression,"First time reaching out, Not really my thing. What would you do? Howdy! So, I've always looking for help and support was kinda weak. Not just that, but abit selfish. We all deal with sh!t. Sure, my problems might be rough. But we all deal with problems, it's human. This has stopped me from reaching out, ever. 

 Well, at the age of 28, and a handful of un-savvory events, I saw a Doc about where my mind was at. I was diagnosed with chronic depression.

 I don't know how this changes my life at all. It just kinda acknowlages the fact I'm prob gonna struggle to be happy for a lifetime. I've had that real love, I have hobbies, I play sports, I keep up with social stuff. Most people think I'm happy and care-free. I can look  more normal then actual normal people, but its an effort to keep up the apperance. I do it because I don't want to be thought of as a bummer, right? 

 I don't know what a post could do about it. I feel like I don't need help, beacuse what help is there even?"
depression,I started marking up my bedside table. I figured it’s safer to mark up an object nobody will see or care about. I put an x on it whenever I feel like ending it. I haven’t ever tried but every time I go to mark it up it makes me feel worse. I don’t want to cut. I just want to feel something positive for once. I really don’t know what to do.
depression,"Feeling very hopeless. I am feeling very hopeless rn, I have no friends as in haven't had real connection with another person in years, my family doesn't really care about, all I have for education is a ged so I don't really have any good future prospects, I really don't like my current job. I just very unhappy rn, and I don't see how my life will ever get better. I'm 19 and feel my life is over essentially that honestly the thought of have to live like this forever, and I don't know what to do or how to deal with it. Anyway I'm sorry I just wanted some place anonymous to vent."
depression,"i will never be happy I just hate myself too much to ever be happy, there's nothing good about me, i don't like a single thing about me, i hate myself too deeply to ever have a meaningful life, i know I'll never get to experience love, and i will never achieve anything of importance, what's the point of living then"
depression,"Do people can cure from depression ? I have been depressed most part of my life, I  I go to therapy and take anti depressants and I am feeling better but there's always this feeling that the fact of living and existing it is too much for me, I feel like at some point of my life I will just kill myself. I feel like I will never do good in life, I insecure af, I do hate my body and just think I am so stupid I will never be enough 

does someone else feels like this?"
depression,"I'm gonna go guys. I'm quitting. I would love to write a wall of text but I just don't no longer have the energy to type it. 


Bye."
depression,"Empty I feel empty and kinda just want to sleep forever or die. I'm not going to get anywhere, the guy I liked could care way less about me than I do him. I tried smiling and faking it but I'm having panic attacks now and anxiety attacks, I can't do this anymore, I want to kms."
depression,"Recently I have lost my closet friend of mine. she was my friend from almost 6 years, but yesterday she passed away because of a car accident. I have no idea what to do now how I will live my life. I am very depressed and stressed right now. I have lost all the hopes"
depression,"I am 19 and I still feel 14 I went through so much. So much trauma and abandonment. I was on my own for awhile at 16-17. Not funding myself though. Just had to find a place to live and way to eat.

I’m learning how to drive. I have a permit. When my mom died when I was 17 it ruined me. Sat in bed for a year. I was an honors student. I am now graduating a year late.

I’m mentally ill. I don’t function too well. I can fake it at some points though. I feel like a small child trapped in an adults body. 

I’m totally reliant on my dad and boyfriend. As I am about to graduate high school, I live in fear. What next?  I’m terrified. I don’t know how I will ever be independent. I feel like a child.

I’m so scared. I don’t want to be useless. I don’t know how to do most adult things."
depression,"I need some help to keep going… I’m about to end my life soon. I (19M) have been depressed since I was 16 years old. I want to kill myself but I can’t find a painless way to go through with it. I really don’t want to hang myself but I will if I have to. I hate myself and my life.

I live at home and I would ask my parents for some help but my mom has 4 younger children to take care of and my adopted father never has enough time for me. I don’t have a reliable support system. 

My parents have abused me and have made it clear that I’m not good enough for anything. They constantly shame me into thinking I don’t deserve good things. Instead of cheering me on when I’m down, they push me down when already down and trying to get back up. 

I’m a socially awkward introvert who hasn’t had a girlfriend since high school. Not to mention I dropped out and got my GED so I have the stigma of a “high school dropout” 

I want to make new friends and meet new people but I self sabotage every opportunity that presents itself. Like today, I was supposed to have a job interview but I didn’t show up. It got in my head too much. My mom shamed me for that one big time. I hate myself even more today because I just feel like a useless man to society. 

Could someone give me some tips? I need help to keep going"
depression,"Hope someone gets mad bc this is the truth God is a pos. He has always shitted on my family. Giving my parents life threathenimg issues, making my siblings all addicts, giving us nothing in life to build on for the future. It pisses me off seeing people get handed money and cars constantly and we can't even afford to pay all the utility bills atm. Not to mention how shitty my personal life is... Life so shitty and god isn't gonna help. He doesn't help anyone. When I finally get back on my shit, IMA throw my middle finger in the air and IMA tell god that he can go fuck himself for all the times he didn't help us. I'm my own savior and I won't put anybody who hasn't proved themselves above myself ever again. That includes you God"
depression,"Financial issues I wonder if anyone else is depressed for the same reason as I am. I started becoming depressed last year when I was denied Pandemic Assistance from unemployment when I got severe Covid and had to leave my job. They told me that I had to pay back the money I had been sent thus far. I got a waiver for it. But then I had to wait a whole year to find out if I was approved for federal PUA. I just learned yesterday that I was denied, even though I clearly qualify. And now they are saying I owe the money again because it’s federal and not state. So I have to ask for another waiver or appeal it. This sent me into another depression. I just feel like there’s no hope. And I can’t do any of the things I enjoy because I have no interest in them. I just can’t believe that someone hiding behind a faceless government entity decided to ruin me financially for no reason whatsoever. They literally want to take the only money I have and leave me penniless. And I’m the one who was sick and lost my job. It just depresses me that the world is so heartless and cruel. Does anyone else feel like that?"
depression,"Feeling myself slowly becoming okay with idea of dying I’ve always told myself no matter how bad it gets that I’d never be able to kill myself, but I’ve realised lately that I’m getting more and more used to the idea. I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a long time but I’ve always been able to shrug them off without too much struggle but as of late those thoughts have become a kind of soothing comfort to me."
depression,"Fluvoxamine (PLEASE READ!) Hey, I don't want to get into detail. I started taking fluvoxamine (an antidepressant) four days ago due to my anxiety and ever since then I can't sleep.

Does anyone know if it is normal in the begging? Does it go away?"
depression,Understanding what's going on After a recent hardship I talked to a professional and was told I had many signs of depression long before the event. I feel like I don't deserve to say I'm depressed because I'm not worth helping. Is this relatable at all? I just feel alone.
depression,"I don’t want to exist anymore I keep sleeping when I should be awake

I’m awake when I should be asleep

Sleeping makes me feel dead to the world

I’d rather be dead to the world than continue to live

I’m just practicing not being here

It’s good practice for the real thing"
depression,"Depression fuel. I don’t know if it’s gotten worse or if I’m just focusing on it more. I don’t think it really matters which one it is. Tinnitus seems to be pretty common in musicians. I don’t think many people have it as bad. The ringing is constant. The more I dwell on it the worse it gets. It makes sleeping a little more difficult. I can’t drown it out with music. Music just makes it worse.

I’ve always had a problem with hearing. Apd basically makes it a million times more difficult to differentiate between tones or understand what people say to me (especially with background noise). I know, ironic. A musician who can barely tell the difference between similar notes. Well it takes me a lot longer to tune my guitar but I manage. Somehow I’ll be more in tune than most people. Anyway… 

I think my hearing is getting worse. It’s always been bad but I’m starting to notice I’m listening to my music a little louder than before. I’m so afraid of losing my hearing. I don’t know what I’d do without it. Music is my life. Its the only thing keeping me sane and breathing."
depression,"Why 2030 is a horrible idea of keeping us a prisoner on this planet Why 2030 is a horrible idea of keeping us a prisoner on this planet until every natural resource is consumed(including the pods we will be living under) and then they'll come and destroy the whole place. Don't trust 2030 ever because those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat.

The rich cunts will fly off to space and beyond leaving nothing to chance down here and keeping us a prisoner here."
depression,"Hair playing Hello. I’m new to this. But I was wondering if anyone plays with their cowlicks or hair when they’re nervous. That “bump” on hair is a cowlick and idk if I’m the only one. I’ve been doing this for years with trying multiple hair products/ benzo prescription anxiety medications (also associated with ptsd and depression). 

Anyone else dealt with this? It’s my bang cowlicks that are killing me (emotionally and hurt sometimes)

People make fun of me in a joking way, but to me I just want it to end. 

Any ideas?"
depression,"end of the line almost this is just a rant, sorry. body is on its way out. Too much soda killed me. kidneys r failing :-/ just at the stage of despair. not even sadness. just acceptance and pain. I ""feel"" my sides all the time, even in bed. But I'm addicted. nobody takes soda addiction serious though, only drugs or alcohol. but it kills me, makes me feel even more pitiful. I've been told I speak gibberish, unintelligible garbage. I had social skill. I could talk, I slur everything now.i don't know what happened. only in the recent 2 years.  it's hard having a normal brain but can't communicate with it. Please take care of your bodies! There's only one of you :)"
depression,"r/place was fun and now it's triggering me Lurking in Reddit has been my paradise. An escape to my depressive life. Then r/place happened, it was fun then my national flag came out, and I was so happy, then the line under it came out.

In the Philippines, where I came from, being neutral is wrong. A subreddit for my country can't even be a shelter to it's citizens, then they should honestly cease calling it a Philippines subreddit but the subreddit for that candidate. 

It's funny happily adding tiles is now triggering me. I feel pathetic because I tried to at least ask them but as usual be attacked, fun. So bye bye r/place, that was fun. Another thing I have to ignore just for my sanity."
depression,"Life is so unfair, and that’s okay Honestly looking through some of these posts makes me so angry and upset. So many good people have to suffer from depression and it breaks my heart. I’ve been diagnosed with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) since I was 10. On top of that I have been diagnosed with ASD, ADHD, OCD, Bipolar, GAD and more, it seems every year brings another diagnosis. They all team up against me and it’s EXHAUSTING. I honestly have tried ending my life multiple times because hey, I’m a walking pile of disorders, I will never be normal, I can’t even comprehend what’s normal, but you know what? That’s okay :) I’ve come to terms with it and want everyone to know that no matter what, we’re here for them. People who don’t have depression (lucky bastards) can go there whole life and never even feel a fraction of what we have to deal with daily. BUT don’t see that and get upset complain that life is unfair, be proud! You’re doing something a majority of the population can’t handle in your LITERAL SLEEP!!! Be proud of yourselves! I know I’m proud of all of you! Keep living the best you can, cause hey, what else can we do? Cheers!"
depression,"Tasteless Almost everything I do is forced I don’t find joy in doing basically everything. I was up at 2am wondering why I’m here and whenever I think of that I think of my brother and cousin. Chances were they were both up and FaceTimed me, I was holding back tears and trying to sound as natural as possible. To say the least I truly believe they saved my life that night and they don’t even know it"
depression,"I wasn't supposed to make it to 18 and I have no idea what I'm doing I never planned on making it past seventeen and I wish I hadn't. All I do is sit around wasting time. It's like I'm in a constant state of grief; I feel so heavy and empty at the same time. I know I'm not entirely useless but the inconvenience of my existence outweighs the benefits. 

All I want to do is lay in bed all day and read self indulgent fanfiction. My family keeps asking me what my plans are and I don't have any, like at all. I honesly don't really care what happens to me but I don't want to upset or worry anyone by getting myself hospitalized like I want to. 

I don't have what it takes to be a fully functional person. I can't really hold down a job for long without getting miserable to the point that I start considering crashing my car on the way to work everyday. I can't go to school without missing more than half of it and having to have accomodations for the little work I actually end up being able to force myself to do, and that was fine for high school but I can't do that if I'm paying for the classes.

I'm honestly probably pretty unpleasant to be around as well, I avoid interaction with other people as much as possible but when I can't I just try to be as flat and reflective as possible. My main goal in any conversation is to keep the other person from getting mad at me so I just end up mirroring whoever I'm talking to. 

I really do wish I could just stay in my room by myself all day. I'm running out of money though and have started applying for jobs since I refuse to ask anyone to loan me money. I know whatever job I get though I'll end up quitting within six months. 

I just was born with pieces missing and that would be fine if it didn't keep ending up being someone elses problem. I just wish I'd been able to stay fifteen forever. I'm not good at being an adult and I hate that I keep letting everyone down. I miss being able to go to school, come home, take a shower, and go to sleep everyday. No one expected me to do anything besides keep my grades up and even if I was a burden then no one could get mad at me because I was a kid.

\[TW for ed mention in the next paragraph. Please skip if that will trigger you at all !!\]

The worst part is I made myself like this on purpose because I was a selfish kid at thirteen and didn't think of how my actions hurt other people. I gave myself an eating disorder on purpose because all I cared about was people thinking I was pretty for once and never bothered to think about the consequences until it was too late and now I've starved myself stupid. The funny part is I was prettier before, I look like shit now. 

I know it's my own fault I'm like this so I can't complain I just wish there was instructions on how to be a normal person. I don't know how people do it everyday. I can't believe that people actually wake up every morning and it's a good thing to them every time. 

I don't want to die at all I just wish I could be in the hospital for a little bit to buy myself some time. But even that would cause problems and is selfish of me to want. 

I just don't know what I'm doing and I'm tired."
depression,"Nausea and depression? Any tips? Hey friends, my girlfriend is unfortunately going through a tough depressive episode  at the moment and she’s been feeling nauseous very frequently. I wanted to reach out and ask if anyone has experienced this as well and if you have any tips as to how we could treat this? She just started taking SSRIs and the nausea was there before so it’s not coming from the medication. Any help or advice you could share with us would be super appreciated. Sending you all a lot of love and encouragement &lt;3"
depression,Some girls in my class are bullying me and it makes me even more depressed I don’t know what to do. It always gets worse and worse. I want everything to end and I feel like my life is nothing but pain. I feel so depressed my whole body aches

depression,"How I feel on most days. The guilt is all-consuming. I feel guilty for merely existing, it is the kind of guilt that only makes sense when you live with depression, it feels primal and as primary to my being as every individual cell in my body. I carry it with me everywhere I go, but unlike a normal physical load, where your body develops muscle over time and you’re finally able to carry it around with ease, you’re building nothing. It feels as heavy today as it did five years ago, in fact, it feels like you’re deteriorating because of it. With this guilt comes shame, as if I have taken the place of another, who chould have lived my life and perhaps lived it better, with a clear purpose and less wasteful of their time here. It feels like I have robbed the world of one who could have contributed far more to it than I ever could, I feel like a place-holder, sitting in a chair never meant for me. It feels like nature made a mistake, like an existential error, a miscalculation on God’s part. A blemish on the face of the earth corrupting what little patch of land I happen to occupy at any given time. I hate feeling terrible but feel terrible about feeling good. Perhaps this is why I sabotage any opportunity I get at being happy, why I ruin everything I touch and appear to be hesitant about pursuing friendships and relationships that add value to my life. A part of me feels like this constant self-flagellation is akin to getting justice for all the sperm-cells I beat in my very first competition, as an unconscious biological speck compelled only by sheer duty. Perhaps this is me getting justice for all the ones who could have taken my place on this world should say, my mother had miscarried me and had another child afterwards, should my father have not taken any liking to my mother at all and eliminating the idea of my conception altogether. "
depression,I guess I'm selfless? I don't want to live in this unhappy world but I couldn't do anything about it cause I couldn't bear to hurt the people who love me

Hellooooooooo so just what the title suggests I have finally been able to wake up today at a good time after my fight with not wanting to leave my bed and to sleep all day but I have no idea how I can remain productive/ put my day to good use lol or to keep my sleep routine being great lol so I think I’d appreciate some advice really also thank you!!!! This was so so hard for me to do (:
depression,"My meds are starting to kick in but it’s too late I can feel my motivation slowly coming back, but it’s too late. My semester is already fucked. My grades are abysmal and there’s no way I can salvage 3 classes of F’s in 3 weeks. This means my scholarships are fucked. I don’t have a job, I can’t pay for this shit. My parents are gonna be so disappointed once I’m finally honest to them about how big of a shitshow this year has been. Their top-of the-class, advanced math placements, creative writing, programming, gifted musician high school turned into a depressed piece of trash who can’t hold a job or attend class because he’s sad. fuck me."

depression,"I want to escape reality permanently (**I posted this as a comment on a subreddit I'm a part of, but decided to post it here to see if anyone else feels this way**)

I just want to escape reality permanently. Reality is full of work, hardship, interpersonal drama, fights, and all other manner of shit.

I'd rather live in a perfect world that's a fantasy then a shitty world that's real.

Sometimes, I just lay in my bed and daydream about a better world to live in. Sometimes, I'm a kid again, and I'm playing my Gamecube for hours in my old home. Other times, I'm the last person on earth, and I just explore the world undisturbed. Other times, I dream it's Christmas, and my whole family is getting along.

That's why sleeping is the highlight of my day. I get to dream and for a moment, I forget what's real and what isn't. I get to truly believe my life is good for a moment, and that everything is okay.

I wish I could just save up money, get put into a pod, and just pay to be put into a dream world of my choosing. I don't care about whether something is real or not anymore. I just want to be happy.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life in this miserable reality."
depression,"How can i turn back time? I would do anything to travel back in time to 10 years ago,  back to 2012.. Everything had a taste, life was simple, the world wasn't so depressing, and every holiday passes in a flash of pure fun. 

There's nothing inside me anymore. I'm about to graduate college (Assuming i don't screw up) and i have nothing to remember these years by. I feel pale. It's like all the fun in the world just faded out. Music doesn't sound the same, gaming feels like a chore, and i can barely muster up any motivation for much else. All i derive pleasure from is either fast food or porn, and both end with me feeling like trash inside. So i really have nothing left to do. 

I feel so tired and so washed out its hard to believe I'm not in my 60's. I got so tired that i took a visit to a psychiatrist, foolishly hoping that maybe i can be saved by a pill or two. 3 months of celexa citalopram and i feel the same as before, i guess not even serotonin can give me the feeling of happiness that i keep dreaming of. Its all in the past, and nothing but a painful memory."
depression,"No Motivation, dont know if depression. Dont have goals but have unrealistic wants. I am lost and have nowhere to go. I barely started my Bachelors and I am now going on to my second semester (I did not pass any of my exams in my first semester). I dont even know how this whole University thing works, like am I a second semester student?? Point is, I just recently broke up with my boyfriend  (been together a bit over 6 year) because of our parents, who are all opposing us. We knew it might happen but only with his parents and not mine, but turns out everyone is against us so we thought its the only way.. to break up. I am super angry and sad at the same time. I sort of found a life I wanted to live when I was with him and I had envisioned something I could do that would make me relatively happy because its with him in my life. But now I have lost it all and any kind of motivation I had, any hopes I had  and any desires that I had are gone. We were in a long distance relationship, him in Australia and me in Germany. I was planning to move to Australia to be with him and live together, but now it all went down the toilet. I also feel like I didnt try hard enough earlier to try and go there. Not that I didnt want to but some why.... I didnt, and I really dont know why. I hate myself for not having pushed harder. I also feel like an imposter, I got here not on my own strength but Im here. I feel like Im just wasting my parents money because Im not getting anywhere and have no goals. Im not even trying for my classes but I feel so bad and I really want to. I got accepted into what I wanted but now I feel 0 motivation. However I am also so scared to just leave it. I want to start working but I feel I will do everything wrong. I fear rejection, I fear not try, I fear everything. I want to find a therapist/psychologist but Im not even successful in that. I feel like dying, without dying. I want to live without living. I want to exist without living, yeah.   
Im so bad at structuring my story and feelings Im sorry but I needed to rant and need help or words to help me out of this hole. I tell myself things, things that motivate me for a mere millisecond. But the moment I move to work on it, its just gone. I feel so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have no motivations. Uni is going bad for me. I have no goals, dont know what I want to do with my life. Feel guilty. Feel like an impostor. Cant find therapy/psychologist."

I feel like Covid took everything away from me, my friends who went back to their home countries, my sanity, my joy, and my fucking will to live. I feel like I’m on constantly on the verge of wanting to just end it all. It feels like it just takes one thing to truly push me over the edge. I’m tired!! I’m so fucking tired!!!

depression,"literally worst i’ve been ever i’ve sort of always had depression but it started to get bad later in middle school. Anyways, lately it feels like “i’m at my lowest” and i feel like it’s the worst i can ever be then it continues to get worse. In the past few months my boyfriend of over a year cheated on me then broke up with me which sent me to the mental hospital as i was already dealing with severe depression and this pushed it over the edge (or so i thought) after i got out i became friends with this girl who had sent me a gift box while i was in inpatient as she had also been, and befriended her. She now turns out to be a really shitty friend as she constantly blames things on me like when her mom found her vape and she said it was mine, or when she didn’t want to invite a girl to a party so she said i didn’t like her. However at the moment she is literally the only friend i have. I’ve had several breakdowns since i’ve been out of inpatient and am in intensive therapy for three hours a day, which is run by a lady who has treated me as well as other patients very poorly, and will kick people out as she pleases, as well as tell our parents we have random drugs in our systems that we didn’t do. They’ve also tried to send me back to inpatient after i had a breakdown and called the national suicide hotline because i legitimately had no one else to talk to. All of my friends at school have left me because i started hanging out with the girl who brought me the gift in inpatient, who obviously isn’t a good person, however she has shit on me and i know for a fact that she’d tell everyone if i unfriended her. She also won’t let me talk to guys she likes even though she has a boyfriend. I hate my life right now and feel so trapped. I cant cry or ask for help or i’ll be sent back to inpatient and my parents will loose all trust in me again."

depression,"old fashioned parents / hide my meds? Hello everyone :) 

So... Depression seems to be highly prevalent in my family. And everyone in my family seems to be getting therapy, however, with very limited results. I didn't get to avoid the curse and have been diagnosed with dysthymia and PD-NOS (basically a bunch of personality disorder traits, but no actually full blown classic personality disorder). 

The depression I get to experience is making me dysfunctional. And now I'm about to drop out from med school, which has been my child dream. My symptoms started at 12 and I'm 26 now. I want to feel happy, motivated and grateful for longer than an illegal high, rare minuscule moment or act. 

I've never been put on antidepressants, but have asked my psychologist for a reference towards a psychiatrist who can prescribe them. They have recommended me to take them earlier on, but I refused out of skepticism. 

Now I feel like I have to take them as some sort of last option to not drop out. The depression symptoms have been pretty bad lately, but dropping out would make it ugly. 

One thing, besides my skepticism, is the fear of my mom finding out. She's depressed herself and has a strong negative opinion on taking antidepressants, even though she has never tried them. How did you guys tell your parents about taking meds? Did you hide it? Would you recommend it? Or not at all? 

I know hiding it sounds a bit deceitful, but I don't want my mom to find out and be more of a burden to her than I already am. 

Anyways, sorry for the long rant. I felt like I had to in order to portray my situation in a representable way. 

All advice is appreciated"
depression,"21. Psychotic depression ages 11-14 was never treated. What are the long term effects? Hi, I am 21 years old and have struggled with major depressive disorder off and on, mostly on for the past 10 years. I had psychosis for 3 years but it was never caught, and both that and my depression went untreated for those years. Now I am on a low amount of medication and although I am still depressed, I can function well enough without it. During episodes I will quit activities I’m serious about, stop moving as much, isolate, sometimes lose my hair, stop hygiene, etc., but I do the minimum so I don’t fail those around me. My current job is my sister’s attendant and that’s flexible. Does untreated psychotic depression have permanent effects? Am I still suffering the after effects, and if so, can I fix it now?

I had a real purpose in a career that I enjoyed. Loved. Was grateful for. Got hurt. They sent me packing. Still hurts today almost 3 years later. Still trying to find that purpose. It just makes me spiral. Especially at night when itsjust myself and my thoughts. I'm worried I'm letting my friends and family down... If there's any other vets with similar feelings... I feel ya. Or anybody really. I hate being by myself with my thoughts."
depression,"Mdma is the cloest i have felt to feeling alive again I'm 20 and i have social anxiety, no motivation, completely lacking interest in life, and no enjoyment out of anything, feeling like i don't deserve to wake up in the morning since i was around 14

dead inside is the only way i can describe it

It is hell on earth and i don't even want to talk about this to anyone just because i'm too tired to even explain, no one will understand anyway

my friends somehow convinced me to go out to a rave with them, took an ecstasy pill (doubt it was even fully real mdma) but holy fuuck.

within 30 minutes i was a new fucking person, could talk to anyone about anything, felt so confident to the point i thought scared myself (i took 15 numbers from girls in less than 2 hours)
Felt so damn passionate about life, made plans to start working out and stop being skinny, start learning programming, was smiling for and a genuinely happy the first time in years, the world was fucking colorful again and not this bland of dead grey that i have been seeing for so long.

but then, after 4 hours it all completely ended

back to my usual self. dead inside, world is completely colorless again, couldn't talk to a girl even if you put a gun to my head

its been 2 years since that and its all the same. I have tried mdma again a few times because i would do ANYTHING to feel like that again, but it never happened. until the day i die will never ever that day, where i was back to being alive for 4 hours."
depression,"Just heard my parents talk shit about me behind my back I'm 20 years old, still living with my parents, I've been depressed for the past 6 years. The last 2 and a half years have been super hard for me and thus I'm not currently working or studying anywhere. I'll even add that I do make money and I do pay my parents rent every month (so I dont feel like Im freeloading)


 My parents are very much aware of my mental problems. However this morning I woke up and I just happen to hear my parents talk how useless I am, playing vidol games all day, sleeping 10 hours/ day, not working etc

I don't really want to face them anymore. I'm going to look for an apartment starting monday and I'll try n move away as soon as possible.

depression,"My Inner Critic is killing me My recovery from my mental illnesses (and process addiction) have been going really well the last few years and I was starting to feel alive again. 

And then I got triggered by something, one of my major supports is taking time away (not from me, but everyone to reset) and I ended up in hospital having a psych eval. And I can see quite clearly, my inner critic is leading the charge. 

It's a voice constantly telling me I'm a failure for being where I am, that the fact I can't keep my apartment tidy is shameful, that EVERYONE else can do a job/social life/healthy eating/exercising etc without burning out. And as much as I know it's not true, that voice calls me deeper and deeper into the darkness. 

I've been in trauma therapy (with EMDR) for a year but that ""I'm not enough"" belief is still taking over. 

Does anyone know of any self-love, compassion or inner critic fighting courses? Or anything that will help?"

A lot of tasks right now are a struggle- doing schoolwork on time, having any actual interest in said school work, making 'acceptable' first impressions with people I socialize with (I never know what to say). Literally everything is exhausting to the point where I feel like its just better to be the blandest version of myself &amp; go with that. No personality, just ""ok this is what we're doing now ? cool"". I don't want to have to make decisions, i want to be told what to do. Actually, i want to do nothing at all. I don't want to be memorable, i want to be small. I don't have any goals. the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning is the hope that one day I'll have a nice home with a nice yard for my future dog to enjoy. that's it. but before that happens, if it ever will (which is highly unlikely since i cant keep up with my school work), I don't want to be a real person.

My friend recently started drinking alcohol &amp; smoking, I don't know what else, were 15 btw. I think this might be because his brother, who he was close to, committed suicide around 6 months ago, and his parents aren't at all close to him, neither do they know about this as far as I can tell, but I don't get to talk to them almost ever so I don't know.

He also has started casting aside his more supportive friend group which I am apart of. while drunk last night he kept on messaging our snapchat group saying that we were a boring friend group, I'm not sure if that was just banter or not. The friend group which he was apart of (which includes me and 5 others + a couple less close ones) doesn't approve of what he's doing, and 70% of them say they don't want to get involved or do anything, and another one of us thinks that he should stop casting us aside and refuses to support him unless he is also starts supporting our friend group which I think is dumb. This specific friend has also had mental health issues which I helped him our with, if its important, you can see more about him in a couple of my previous posts asking for help with how to support him which I have now got sorted.

I think that's all, but I'll add to this post if I think of more, please ask questions in comments if that helps and ill try and answer them as truthfully as possible. I just need help supporting him because I don't know what to do.

Thanks in advance."
depression,"My mother sent me to a sort of exorcist I have dissociation disorder and my main problem about that is the child who takes my body and does what he wants, he sometimes comes in my head and I dislike it. My mother believes in things like energy or cosmology but she's still a little sceptic. Personally I don't believe in this type of things at all. 
So we went to this man, who does a sort of exorcism and he said the child in my head disappears but I disagree. 
If I write it on this subreddit it's because this event shows how desperate we are my mother and I, so much unsolved problems and my mother don't know what to do ...

depression,"Having trouble keeping my “happy” face on. I (40m) have had bouts of depression since I was a teenager. 95% of the time no one can tell and the rest of the time I can play it off as not getting enough sleep or blaming it on my allergies. But for the last 2 weeks I can’t seem to put my fake smile on. 

I woke up hysterically crying just now and just told my spouse I had a nightmare that I can’t remember. I’m hoping crying it out in my sleep allowed me to shed some of my built up stress and depression so I can make it through today. I’m in HR and I’m supposed to go into work today on my day off to set up a going away party for one of our associates who was just promoted and is being transferred and I don’t even want to get out of bed. I know I’m not going to look “ok” and am really not in the mood to have anyone ask me if I’m ok. I’m not but there’s nothing they can do or say to help so I’ll just blame it on my allergies today.  

Anyone have any better excuses to use around co workers?"
depression,"There's no point in living at all TL;DR: College student, burntout, struggling to pay for therapy, don't know who I am and feeling like a lost cause. Life has no meaning anymore.

Hey, it's my first time posting here. I'm really at a dark place in my life right now. As per the title, I really don't see any point why I'm still here and living. I'm a college student, and it burns me out. I don't enjoy studying anymore like I used to when I was in high school. I was an overachiever, I had a lot of awards, medals but now, I feel like I'm a lost cause. I don't know if I really wanna study anymore, I don't know what job I want to do, I just want to do nothing. But I can't. I grew up in a family where your self-worth is based on your productivity and your achievements, they don't pressure me but I know they're expecting from me. Being an only child, my mom confides in me with any problem and it's becoming my problem too. We're struggling financially, my mom has no job, we rely on my aunt's food and clothes on some. I'm so tired of feeling like I will be dependent on others. In fact, I don't like depending on anyone because I know they can use it against me. Almost all of my things are given by my relatives, luckily I got in a state university, we don't have to pay for anything. And with that, I can't afford therapy and medication. I only have a few bucks left from my savings and that won't even last for 2 therapy sessions, so it won't make any sense too. I only have 2 friends. Both of them are my friends from highschool and one is with now in college and we have the same major but I don't wanna go to her for this because I know she's been burtnout too. The other's in a different university and we seldom talk now. I'm an introvert too, plus with severe social anxiety so I don't have that much opportunity to make friends. My family thinks I'm alright cause I'm always ""studying"" wherein fact I just spend most of my time crying and not learn anything. I actually feel dumb. I have high-functioning depression. I may seem put together but I'm literally broken into pieces and I don't know who I am.  I just think this is the only thing I could get something off of my chest. Thanks for reading this long message."

depression,"I want to end it but I'm scared of hurting others I've been debating suicide for a couple years now, and I keep being told ""everything is going to be fine"" ""don't give up"" ""it'll all get better soon"" but nothing changes. I quit my job because we were severely underpaid and understaffed. I've been cheated on or left for an ex in almost every single relationship I've been in. I've been stabbed in the back by most of my friends that I've called family. I smoke weed because antidepressants have no effect on me, and lately everytime I smoke I get a horrible anxiety attack that makes me feel like my heart is going to burst. So for the past couple I've been drinking myself to sleep every night, and if I dont then I don't sleep.

I've asked a bunch of people for advice but i just get hit with the ""you need medication"" bs that never works. I don't think seeing a therapist for help either because I'm such a big over thinker. Especially when I'm alone and I'm sober, I overthink about my whole life. These last couple of days have been the hardest because I want to end it all, but I dont want to hurt the people I love/care about.

So I'm taking my chance at reddit to see if anyone can give me advice or are dealing with the same struggles because I really need it right about now. 

Thank you for reading if you read the whole thing."
depression,"I feel weak for still caring Why is it that even when someone hurts me I still care? Is it because it takes a lot for me to open up? Because I seal myself off so tight from everyone. When I finally let someone in and they hurt me it feels like every fear I had was correct.
Yet like a moron I still hope they are doing well even years after they hurt me. Sometimes I even just want to talk to them but I know it would not end well.
Wish I could just hate them and nothing more. Such a moron"
depression,"trash i don't know how to love. what i have to give is not love. maybe it once was, or could've been. but now, you just get the leftover scraps of what i managed to keep for myself. halving those is unappreciated, i don't blame anyone, it's hard to even notice you are receiving anything. my attempts are therefore equivalent to throwing half of what little i have out the door, for no reason. i don't get it. i'm just very dumb and spent what i had wrongly. a big risk taker is me, and they haven't paid off. and now, i'm a freak. heaven and hell, sweet poison. a person trying to run away from themselves, whichever self it is that they feel at a given moment. wrong things with calls to stop, and right things with suppressing mantras to grow. i don't know where it comes from, but when alone, thinking nice or happy towards those i feel i shouldn't, i get opposing vivid imagery in my head. gruesome endings to myself, not in motion, just the aftermath of me there in my final state. it's stark, and like a flash. a deep wish to close and never open. a subconscious desperation to prevent me from doing what leads me to pain. it only comes when i don't believe anything nice i do could be wanted or liked, and i'm back at that stage. do not worry, it's familiar and survivable. i wouldn't let you in even if you wished to help. nobody touches my core, and when they disrespect my line after clear unambiguous warning, a knife to the throat in self defence seems like a reasonable way to make one understand if words they don't respect. express permission is required. don't mistake my selflessness as boundless. i protect and hide the minimum i can. i don't want to hide anything, but i must, because a life of being open and honest makes me vulnerable to lasting pain from the smallest of things. your handful of words could be life-changing, and i fear the echoing days where being repeatedly beaten into a lesser-self is each day's itinerary. i've gone through it enough. full stimulation ending with a out would be blissful. weightlessness, altered mental state, music so in your head you don't know where it's coming from, and something to blow my mind. end me on that note, and to those that'd shed a tear, you never understood me. but alas, that'd be a problem for the living. erased would be i, welcoming whatever the play may be. water doesn't flow upstream, and that i take to heart, so let me enjoy the meanderings of the current as it swirls down to the drainage system to carry away the used. what a dramatic bit of text. and for what? a temporary expunging of my dismal thoughts and the ecstasy of dreaming of solutions to problems beyond my capability. if this world operated on the principle of voluntarism, maybe i'd wanna stick around more. in a way, it is how the world works, because we always choose to avoid the harm we are threatened with by those who protect us from ourselves. i'd rather die than perpetuate this sickness which i and you are victim of. what a shitty homogenised and domesticated, hollowed-out and spent species. try saying no and sticking to it. coil back into the hole whence you came."

depression,"At what point do I need to call a health care professional? My fiance has major depressive disorder. And she is dealing with a lot of childhood trauma. She has told me she thinks about killing herself. She has told me this more than once. It scares the shit out of me and she doesn't want me to talk or ask for help. But I'm scared she is going to hurt herself and I am not equipped to help her by myself. I am not a healthcare professional and I flat out do not know what I am doing. I've tried to talk to her about getting help, but it always ends in her saying I don't know what I'm talking about (which is true). She refuses to set up an appointment with her therapist and I've been trying to get her to go back for well over a year. Everytime I bring it up, she gets furious with me. I've offered to pay for her therapy. She'll get moments of clarity, but during this clarity she still does not seek out help. She quite her job 2 months ago, which was a huge stressor for her. I saw huge improvements mentally from her, and I was hoping she was taking steps in the right direction. She had another breakdown last night. I've been working particularly long hours these past two weeks, and I have not been able to give her as much attention. When she gets like this, I truly fear for her safety. I am starting to recognize PTSD symptoms in myself when she gets like this. I start to walk around on egg shells whenever I detect she is minorly upset. I know that's selfish, but I am trying to explain that I am not mentally or professionally prepared to handle what she is going through. I feel she needs professional help, but I don't know how to get it to her. I've offered to get her on my insurance and pay for her, but she would ""rather die alone then do that now"". Just two days ago she was talking how she was so happy with me. 

I desperately need advice on how to help her. And I need to get her that help before she goes into another downward spiral. I don't have the tools to help her when she gets in that state - she doesn't have any local friends, and her family are all POS and won't help. What can I do to help her? How do I convince her to set a therapy session up. Next time she gets like that, do I need to take her somewhere? Right now she wants to leave and go ""somewhere"" that is not near me. She has no money, no job, and is about to lose insurance. She has no other support. She ""will not put herself in a position where she can not support herself"" by marrying me. And she tells me I lack empathy for not being able to help. It's not that I lack empathy, it's that I am not equipped to help her. I am not a mental health professional. I do not know what I am doing. And to make things harder, she starts attacking my personal character when she gets like that. Starts to play at heart strings I get weekly therapy for (The kind of heart strings I've spent years of therapy to get through). And by the end of the night, she finally goes to sleep, and I am left in a ball shaking in fear and depression myself.

Please, does anybody have any advice for me. I am to scared to leave her a lone. I'm scared to try and talk to her about getting help in case I trigger her. And I'm scared she is going to leave me like she said and actually go hurt herself."

My thing is, I don't know if I am really that lazy or is my dad making me feel like I am. I know damn well that I am doing my best juggling everything on my hands. I provide food for us and I also pay the bills. 

I hate when my dad belittles my job just because he thinks I am doing nothing at home when in fact I am in front of my computer screen from 6am to 6pm doing work. He always tells me to find another job as if finding jobs right now is not difficult. 

I'm sorry if I am ranting right now but I feel like I am doing everything to keep myself and my family afloat yet my efforts are being disregarded as if I am a lazy piece of shit doing literally nothing at home. Sometimes I just feel like crying and breaking down because I feel like i am not up to par with what I am supposed to be.

depression,"I’m 17 and it’s just getting harder and harder and I’m not sure how much more I can take I have struggled with depression for a big majority of my life I’ve attempted suicide multiple times when I was 5 and 6 and one more time when I was 14. I have no motivation to do anything in life I cry myself to sleep every night I dread going to school because it makes my suicidal thoughts more frequent. I have a therapist and anti-depressants but half the time it feels neither of those work for me. Fuck man I just feel empty and exhausted 24/7 I don’t even do things for myself anymore only to keep up appearances. Anyone else relate?

depression,"I’m in so much agony that I feel everything and nothing at the same time. Perhaps it’s becoming one with pain. All I know is I’m in a state where I can’t pretend to be human anymore. Whatever that was in me, left. I feel like a thing than anything."
depression,"Personal dark age ahead. I'm really a sad excuse for a human. No job, just smoke and drink pop and browse the internet. I haven't had to suffer very much as others do. I'm still too young to be this hopeless, but I'm getting too old to start over from zero.

(There could be a context paragraph here important to the mood of the moment and the times ahead, but it should go without saying, I just don't want to say it).

I can't get a job. It's too complicated for me. It's just been too long since I've had one, and all the most accessible jobs require putting yourself on the frontline of a busy food, retail or service establisment. I'm getting too old for that. Anyone I'd be working for would know that I'm in my thirties hadn't had a job for years and probably have a drug problem and a work ethic problem. It just won't make sense to hire me.

So much of this is my fault. I become nothing more than an example of how not to live your life, of why it's important to work hard in spite of the challenges. Too many times in my life I allowed depression to turn me into a worse person, affecting my life in a negative way and thus making the depression worse. And now the only way to escape these feelings is to give up on everything.

So I wouldn't feel bad for me or anything, although I do feel bad for the child that grew up into the person that I am right now, and I feel bad for anyone else who had hopes that I might turn out better. It's just not working out and I'm so far beyond the point of turning things around."

My goal in life is for my band to eventually earn the chance to tour around the world at some point. We are all really talented musicians and we practice together relentlessly. Having a musical career is a bit unrealistic but hard work can carry you just as far as luck can, and you only get one go at life. However, more recently my depression has been interfering with my optimism and I've been doubting my abilities. I'm still going to practice but it just feels like I'm going through the motions. I'm young, i turn 20 next month and I'm still in college, so if music doesn't work out then I have my degree as a backup plan but I just get so discouraged and doubt my abilities and capabilities so often. It's awful. It helps me to know that I'm not alone. People from all walks of life suffer too."
depression,"Has lexapro helped anyone with dulled emotions and low self-esteem? My best friend finally started on an SSRI! She got prescribed lexapro yesterday. I’m so proud of her.
She’s very jealous since I have ADHD, and basically the first stimulant I tried had immediate effects and worked amazingly, but I wanna help her find the best medication for her.
Anyone who felt emotional numbness, fatigue, low self-worth/guilt, irritability, hopelessness and social withdrawal feel better after lexapro? She doesn’t face that much anxiety and no panic or panic attacks, just constant numbness and insecurities and poor sleep and lethargy and stuff. 
I personally think she needs something more stimulating but that just might be my draw to stimulants myself bc of my naturally low dopamine levels.

depression,"there’s mold growing in my room and yet i do nothing about it. it sits in the corner and festers, like a stain on my mind letting me know how gross i’ve let myself become. and yet i do nothing about it. it grows, slowly but surely. creeping up on me when i least expect it. sometimes it feels like it’s in my brain, slowly eating it away until there’s nothing left of me but a pulsating mass of mold. and yet i do nothing. because what can i do if i don’t have the energy to eat anymore. it seems so easy, just clean it up. but i just can’t do it. i do nothing. and it stays there. festering and growing until it consumes my life like wildfire. mold"
depression,hole to deep to get out of this is just kind of a vent post but someone to talk to would be also very much appreciated but for the past few months I've attempted at trying for a relationship but it doesn't seem to work because typically I get attached too quickly which is a valid reason for not staying its just very hurtful when its not communicated and it just ends up wit me getting ghosted  I don't have a drive for anything anymore lately I've just kinda resorted to self harm just to attempt to have a chance at dealing with these overwhelming thoughts I thought I actually made a decent amount of progress toward having a better mental health but after I relapsed I don't think it gets better how can I get better if I cant do anything properly these days just slowly become more of a burden to wake up to I always hear my family talk about me how much of a disappointment I've grown to be can't say I disagree how does one live this life when everything feels so bad difficult and overall just underwhelming being 18 now I thought I would at least have somewhat of a decent understanding on what I would like to do but it turns out I'm just as clueless as I've ever been.
depression,"I cannot get laid 
I hate women at this point, im horny 24/7, every girl thinks they’re too good for me. Nomatter how many girls i talked to no matter how hard i try im rejected and ghosted.

depression,"A letter goodbye *A letter I wrote because I'm drunk and don't want to be here anymore.*

Hi mom, 

Just wanted to take moment and write what I'm feeling. I'm better at writing than I am speaking. You know that. (Have also sent this to Paul.) 

Today marks a year since being in this headspace, that is feeling completely hopeless and worthless. I know its hard to hear coming from your client (your son), but its true. It's 12am as I right this still wide awake on the edge without the way out that I want. I feel so trapped. If I'm being honest my parents think I'm better, but what is better? To many its being ""happy and content"", I'm not sure I know what that is anymore. I'm just living on autopilot at this point. 

There are days where I really wish I never woke up. Like why am I here and still feeling the same way with therapy and medication? I truly believe this life is not for me but hey I guess I'm just crazy and that's why I'm taking these meds and talking about how I feel. Everyone is brainwashed to be happy, but I understand what life really is. 

We have talked long hours about why I need to be here, but why? I just simply don't understand. I really don't seem myself ""happy"" or ""content"" with myself or this life. I'm on the outside looking in and not really wanted. My parents would say otherwise that I'm loved and cared for, but fuck honestly am I really cared for other than mom, dad, and my brother? No one else really matters in my ""family."" They are just people who care about a random person, me, and would move on after I died just like everyone else. 

Yeah this is hard to read but these are the feelings I have everyday. I seem okay but I'm really not. My parents are wanting me to get a job to start helping them and myself for the future. Maybe I'm lazy, or honestly maybe I don't see a future for myself here so I just do what I do. Sleep a lot, don't work, drink here and there to escape. Yeah I said it, I drink. So what? It helps me escape who I am. Supposedly I have a higher risk for addiction and maybe its true I don't know. 

I'm not sure why I'm so lazy, why I just can't work. The money doesn't interest me, nor does traveling anymore. I'm so lost and confused about what I'm doing here. I truly believe one day I will end up killing myself and it scares me but also it comforts me knowing I can stop everything when I want. I'm not happy here and haven't been for awhile. 

You being a Christian man, I tried to find God and reach out saying how I felt. All I felt was anger and more depressed. Maybe I'm just not good enough for him, I don't know. If I'm wrong well sorry, its just hard now to have faith or believe. I'm not really afraid of death anymore like I was. It seems peaceful to me, like a good nap. Just unaware that you are asleep. Just gone. 

To mom, I'm sorry if this hurts you. I don't ever mean to burt you, but I'm really hurting myself everyday. I don't understand why I'm here, I thought I did but clearly that's not it. I honestly want you to know that at the moment you, dad, and Michael are keeping me here today."
depression,"Thinking of ending it I dont know what I'm doing in life anymore. I dont really enjoy anything anymore. Work is especially bad right now. I dislike my coworkers and my boss is irritating me. This girl I work with we decided things wouldn't work out, but I'm still in love with her and can't move on. I've tried finding a new job, but I'm not even getting interviews. I dont enjoy doing anything at home. And I just wish it would all end. There is just no joy anymore."
depression,cannot sleep i start therapy tomorrow. idk if it will help but now i will have mountains of bills and insurance shit to handle and keep up with. I watched a video of rastafari people. they have everything people in the modern world crave. (not saying they aren't modern) I would like to live like neolithic times or live as a simple farmer. if im already going to... i might as well live my dreams. live a simple life. i reject modern life. i will not sell my soul. would rather face the brutality of nature than a soulless corporate life. let a snake kill me lol whos with me
depression,"Cue haunting guitar luck from the Doors.... This is the end...beautiful friend, the end

Feels like I’m getting to the end of something which is scary. I’m hoping it’s not a dead end, but turning the corner. Time will tell"
depression,"My family hates me. I don’t blame them. I haven’t felt loved in… let me correct myself. I haven’t been loved by my family in a long time. My sisters think I’m a terrible brother because I don’t have to ability to crawl out of my cave and pretend to be happy. My dad doesn’t have the ability to see me as anything but a disappointment. I am one. And my mom can’t come to terms with the fact that I’m not that warm, “always happy”, little boy who wore ties over Batman t-shirts. She’d rather be angry that the kid who “saw the best in everyone and made the best in every situation” is now cold and distant. I became a realist and all of the ignorant optimists hated me for it. My parents are trying so hard not to get rid of me. They can’t handle that I have a mind of my own. I’m not obedient anymore. I’m not afraid of my father anymore. They want to throw me out into the street and forget I was ever their son. If I ever told them how I really feel, they would certainly do it. “I don’t have the heart to tell the lady who gave me life that I don’t want to live anymore?” And I hate myself for who I am now. I want to go back to being ignorant and happy. Ignorance is bliss. Then I’d be someone my family could live with."
depression,"i’m getting so tired i don’t think i can do it much longer. i relapsed 5 days ago. i’m so lonely, all my friends only care about themselves. i feel as if i’m the “convenient friend” that is used when no one else is around or because they know i’ll be there for them. it’s pathetic of me, i’m always there for them and try to make them happy and to laugh and to give them a shoulder to cry on even though no one gives me that in return. i just don’t want anyone i care about to feel like i feel, even if they make me feel that way. again it’s pathetic i’m well aware. maybe that’s why i’m so obsessed with the idea of having a partner, because the idea of dedicating yourself to another person fully in every way is so beautiful to me, i’d love to do that for someone and it would mean to world to me to have someone do the same to me. god what id give to have someone return the same effort, love, and care that i do. i know id be a good girlfriend, id give myself to them but still be independent and have my boundaries, and i’d be the most supportive and sweet girl to them. i want to give my all the all those i care about. i just wish someone did the same to me. i have so many issues though, addicted to self harm, extreme body dysmorphia, depression, anxiety, daily panic attacks, and more. how can i be loved? and what’s funny is that no one notices all those things, not my friends, not my family, no one. i have no one. i don’t know what to do."
depression,"Everything is so hard to do I mean it always was, especially that I have adhd and my executive dysfunction goes wild. But now it’s like impossible to do everything, even of it’s like putting on earphones or going into class, when I’m sitting right before the classroom. It’s so tiring and I’m so disappointed in myself that I can barely function when I need to focus and do things, because I have important exams in less than two months."
depression,Lonely when everyone waits for you to fuck up.. When evweryone waits for you to fuck up again its like they automatically think your just numb to it...i wish that was the case but the truth is tue more you fuck up the more people expect it then more they expect it the more it hurts the more it hurts the more the anxiety comes when presented with opportunity to fuck up and the more that anxiety comes the bigger you end up fucking up..to the point where you lash out at everything and everyone you love...you become a monster in the eyes of those you love..but in your head your still the frightened child who cant understand why things are happening...they tell you its time to grow up and stop making excuses you cant use your traumas forever to just crutch a long..as if i enjoy being waste..
depression,"Thanks for leaving me My depression would've shut out everyone anyway at some point, including you. So thank you for doing it for me."
depression,"Am I depressed? Or am I just daydreaming? Ultimately I’ve been so immersed in my own thoughts, I’ve been thinking all day and all night about hypothetical situations that by just imagining it, I’m felling so happy, yet I feel like I kinda want to cry. 

I’ve been thinking only about falling in love with someone, to get a special connection with somebody, don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a wonderful family, marvelous friends, but it’s a different thing, I kinda want to idealize my life with somebody else,  but I’m tired of just thinking about it, I want to share my life with somebody else, I want to get home and speak about the simplest thing that I got out of my mind, I want to be listened, to be worth for somebody, I want to have somebody in my life that I know is gonna do their best for me, and to be a mutual thing. 

I don’t feel like my life sucks, to be honest, I’m kinda grateful to have the life that I have and I love the fact that I’m alive to see the sky, the trees, to feel the air, the world is a Marvelous place to live to me, but somehow I feel empty inside. 

I just want to have the joy of having someone, unconditionally, that’s it."
depression,"feeling ill all the time most of the time i feel sick and my stomach hurts, or i get bad acid reflux, chest pain, my head hurts, i'm dizzy, i feel weak, i get constipated/diarrhea. and for no reason. my symptoms are so inconsistent and go away when i'm truly distracted so i think it's rarely ever not in my head, it has to be because of my depression/anxiety. i spend so much time in bed again and this is probably the most important year of my life so i can't keep doing this. i'm on antidepressants and anxiety medication so i need some other way to control it but i don't know how. i'm so frustrated and upset and my family are always angry about it too which makes everything worse :("

depression,"That Exhilarating Feeling That exhilarating feeling you get when you realise that you experiencing and learning, and you have so fucking more more to learn;  and this feeling that you are experiencing, you are gonna get that a countless many more number of times, is what am feeling right now. But I question/worry that while am going through this beautiful emotion this doubt doesn't start creeping in that - you are tooo late in this journey, have wasted a lot of your time, have you? That feeling then just starts becoming numb. I don't find that learning and experiencing as exhilarating. Starts thinking myself to be dumb."
depression,"I have no-one to talk to, for a LONG time. My situation has gotten much worse in recent weeks.

The last time I saw my doctor was in early February. I had an appointment set for Tuesday.

I was going to talk to her about the rapid deterioration. And I was excited to tell her that I had found a new job, because work is my primary stressor.

She had long on leave, so I couldn't call in. I was really anxious to speak to her.

I don't have any friends, or anyone I can turn to.

**Unfortunately, I contracted COVID-19 and her next appointment isn't for another three weeks.**

GUHHHH!!!!!!"
depression,"It feels awful not to be taken seriously. I’ve been in an internship for a year now, it ends next week. That’s good, because my mental health is awful lately. My boss has been tolerant, but she also makes it very clear she’s not taking it seriously at all. How many times has she said “Other people have it worse than us”, or “Think positive.” We had a talk with my supervisor and she said something like “When I was younger, I was difficult as well.”

Difficult? … Not like it matters, but she’s the same age as me. 

Yesterday I was supposed to finally go to work again but I just couldn’t. My doctor gave me a sick note, and I texted her that. Her literal response was: “what. why this” … I didn’t respond because I slept all day and quite literally don’t even know what to say. And just now that I am writing this she sent me a “?”. 

It makes me feel so bad and guilty. I just want this all to be over with."
depression,"I'm alive, no one knows why, I planned to kill myself a very long time ago, but I'm still alive, I planned to kill myself again, but for some reason I'm still around, I planned to kill myself so many times, but I'm alive. I passed out with a loaded pistol in my hand, but I'm still here. Why? When you live your life believing that you will someday end it, it makes it very hard to plan for the future, because you spend your life thinking that there will be no future for you. So when you reach those milestones that you never thought you would see, you feel... Nothing. You never expected to make it this far, so you never built up the anticipation and desire to get there. And so there's no reward. So what's the point of continuing afterwards? I dont constantly plan on killing myself anymore, but still,  what am I looking forward to? I'm 24 years old and I never expected to make it past my teens. What kind of life could I possibly hope for? I never planned to live."
depression,"My Girlfriend got admitted to a Psych ward It has been three months since we last spoke, I still openly state that I am still in a relationship. She was suddenly forced by her parents to be admitted and I did nothing but talk to her dad that led to him hating me more.  Is it bad to feel so much pity towards me, Is it selfish to think that this is just too much for me? Is it bad to let go even though we haven't talked yet?  Am I a bad person for thinking about these things? I always blame myself all the time because of things I should've done better, even though it was purely because of her past traumas and her relative passing."

depression,"I feel like I'm my mother's ""failure child"". I'm currently a single mother of 4 and my love life isn't the greatest. I have no job, I'm depressed, and I'm temporarily staying at my mom's since I got evicted. Last night my mom was trying to tell my younger(F19) sister to humble herself and obey her or she'll end up like me. She stated ""See if you don't listen to my advice that I tell you, you'll end up like your sister. Her bf is abusive, she's struggling to take care of the kids by herself, and she wanted to go to college, but now she can't. We told her not to get with him, but she didn't listen."" It's all true, but hearing my mom tell my younger sister.. I'm embarrassed of myself and my situation. I was depressed, but now I feel like digging a hole and burying myself."
depression,"Please help me I’m sorry if the title sounds desperate, I’m not sure what to include there. The past few days have been extremely overwhelming for me and I can’t afford therapy so I don’t really know what I can do at this point to help myself and I’m here to ask for any resources / advice y’all can give.
I was a abused for about a year and every single day was spent wondering if I’ll be alive the next and it messed me up. Recently I’ve found myself talking about it more because some of the abuser’s friends still try to do stuff to me and i don’t know why. I used to be an extremely social person earlier, I was also great with work, spent about 12-13 hours a day working without any issues and the rest was spent with my friends. During the year I was isolated from all of my friends and I wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone. I lost touch with most of them but only one stayed. Recently that one person has also started drifting and to some extent I understand why. I’m just not myself anymore. I feel feverish 24/7, I can’t do anything fun, my energy’s gone, everything seems so difficult to do. No one wants to be around that and I understand that part. But I’m really not able to live like this. I feel so sick all the time that I’m barely able to get anything done and I cry at the smallest of things. I really don’t want this to be my normal and I’d really appreciate any help anyone could provide. Thank you so much"
depression,"If only 
I fantasize everyday about getting to kiss and makeout with a woman finally. Im so hungry for this i want this to happen to me so badly, i want to hold a girls hand snd gi hammicking and have adventures and kiss her, i will probably never experience this blissfulness and i guess this is something i need to accept. No girl will ever open her legs for 5’10 4/10 me, its a futile endeavor. And im not popular enough to makeup for my inferior genetics. This hunger for women goes deeper than material it’s psychological."
depression,Dad keeps telling me I’m wrong When i get upset over things my dad will tell me i’m interpreting the situation wrong because of my depression and thats actually not what happened and i feel like I’m going crazy because I feel like he’s not listening but also like I can’t be wrong all the time and I don’t know what to do

depression,"Fried At this point it feels  like I'm just fooling myself  to ignore  all the horrible  trespasses, it's like if I don't run with the crowd then, it's something  wrong with  me , run with  the crowd,  everything  in my body tells  me I'm in the wrong  place and need to leave. I have live a ife of not trusting  anything  or anyone with my expectations, but after finding  out a i had a daughter , I choose  to soften up. Biggest  mistake  of my life was thinking  I had support  out side  of myself,  it just didn't  exist. But I also found  out I couldn't  trust  Noone that I had built my entire  life around. After panicking for years try to get my life together and just putting  my head down , I finally  push my mental  to a point  when my body  just gave up. Lost all desires. I have traveled  the problems, where I've  seen and participated in up lifting  and being  there for people, where I was left to deal on my own people I've protected  and sacrifice for had no problem  stabbing  me in my back for anything  new and shiny.  And I blame my self, for even  thinking  for a second anyone ever  valued  me. The hardest  part  about depression  is that you can't accept  the reality  of those thoughts  that haunt you, and it's away  out just getting  away  from any  and everything  that brought  you to this  point,  and the only reason  your staying  is because  you're stuck or you haven't  made the decision  to trust  what  you're body  is telling  you. 💯"

I just want it to be over, I’ve lived a life time worth of trauma, how much more can I possibly take? My sisters going off to university, and all I can think of is how much I wish that were me.

I've never been diagnosed with depression, or any mental illness for that matter, and every time I've asked for help in the past I've basically been brushed off by medical professionals. It takes a lot for me to even get to the point of asking because my anxiety around speaking to people I'm unfamiliar with is extremely high, and it's harder knowing that they've never cared before. I need help, or I'm going to ruin my own life because my issues are so bad, but I don't even know how to ask at this point. I'm so ashamed.

I get the feeling that my parents are very disappointed in how I've turned out. I used to be that really smart kid that got all A's and B's and never got in trouble. In middle school I was in some advance classes, but I was starting to struggle a bit and felt like I wasn't good enough no matter how hard I tried. It was mostly in math, I always felt really lost and like everyone except me knew what to do. And then about when I started 7th grade I started online school. I tried to do the work, but got really depressed being at home constantly. Eventually I got so behind I didn't achtually finish any of my courses. But I passed anyway because I had an okay overall score, so I guess it didn't matter. And thats how it's went for the past few years. Now I'm a freshman and have no idea what to do. I know there no way I can pass with how little I've learned, so I was hoping my parents would just let me drop out and focus on working a job. But it didn't work out like that and now I feel hopeless. I feel like I've messed up my life so bad that I should just quit and die. And I feel terrible because I know that It's all my fault, and that I shouldn't even be complaining right now cause I did this to myself.

I’ve been sleeping with the lights on in my room every night for the past few months.  When it was really bad I even had to have the lights on in the rest of the house, because even though I couldn’t actually see whether the rest of the house was lit, simply KNOWING that the rest of the house was dark made me feel sick and I couldn’t relax unless I knew the house was lit.  I’m past that point now and can get by with just my bedroom light and a light to the way to the bathroom in case I need to go in the middle of the night, but anything less puts me in panic mode.  Can anyone else relate to this?  I don’t understand why being depressed does this to me but it always seems to be correlated with my level of depression"

Nothing to motivate me. 0 friends to hang out. I try to ride my bicycle but social anxiety makes everything so hard and I wish I was back home again. And I lie to bed. Get up. Smoke more. Browse reddit more. Maybe drink another coffee and that's it. 0 flow. 0 interests anymore. It's been like that 5 years. I may be flowing for a bit sometimes but quickly goes off.

So at work we've had a load of 'inspiring speakers' - you know, leaders, people who do amazing things, all that. And it's meant to inspire us. It just does the EXACT OPPOSITE. You know, I'm not a leader. I'm an admin assistant. All I'm worth is the money I can donate from my wallet. I'm not special like these people. And I HATE it. I hate how small it makes me feel and in turn how nasty THAT makes me feel, like, it's good amazing things are being done, right? Why am I just jealous and not happy they're happening? 

I have an MA and a load of hobbies and stuff and honestly it means nothing because I don't actually ACHIEVE anything with other people in the world and/or work, you know? I hate how worthless everything makes me feel. But I also know I'm not a people person. I'm not a leader. I'm autistic as well so it's like...I can't fathom how people start doing things with people. I don't get it. And I hate that. I hate how utterly useless to this world I am apart from what monetary support I can afford. The anonymous impersonal nothingness of cash donation to people who are Worthy and can Lead Causes. 

I really hate being me."
depression,"I can't seem to wake up in the morning I dont know if anyone else has experienced this; but I need some insight.

So I've been taking antidepressants for 3 years now and around September 2021 things got really stressful to the point where the meds became ineffective and I zombified. My CPTSD showed up and so did some menopause-like symptoms (mind you I'm 21F).

My psychiatrist switched me from SSRI to SNRI. But that didnt help, and then he switched me again to TCAs. The TCA I took caused me severe adverse effects so I had to stop it and went through a period of 4 weeks of withdrawal and relapse before I restarted the same SSRI.

It wasnt only moments ago that I realized that since October 2021, I havent been able to wake up properly in the morning. Like I had Uni at that time and skipped every morning (8am) rounds/lectures, and may show up for the rest if it's possible for me. And then with reading and exam weeks I'd only wake up after 12pm. If I did manage to wake up early in the morning, I'm pretty much dysfunctional and very sleepy.

Since I've graduated, I havent had much of a reason to wake up before 12pm, so I didnt think much of it when I was sleeping in every day. But yesterday, I decided to wake up early today so that I could study while my family is at work/school. And found it really difficult to get out of bed. It got me thinking that I struggle really bad to wake up the last couple of days, and I couldnt remember when was the last time it wasnt like this.

Each week I'd make some kind of excuse or reason behind it. Like ""Oh this is just stress. Oh this is the menopause-like symptom. Oh this is depression relapse. Oh this is just because of winter and seasonal affective disorder. Oh this is withdrawal symptoms. Oh this is laziness""

But looking back at it now. 5 months of this doesnt seem right."
depression,"New depressed member Hello all , I m.new here , kinda depressed but fine."
depression,"How can I describe my condition better to my psychiatrist? (TW: suicide, self-harm, disordered eating, possible SH) I have been officially diagnosed with dysthymia by a psychiatrist. However, I suspect my condition is more serious and I could possibly have MDD. Also, I think I have issues other than depression. 

I am a college student and under normal condition, I could write articulate essays and achieve ideal grades. But I have been having these episodes where I just shut down and unable to think. I stare at my laptop and nothing comes out. I could read and write to others, but I don't talk verbally. I avoid physical contact. I struggle to do daily chores like showering or tidying things up. It goes on for a few months. I missed out on my part-time job and friends gatherings. Needless to say, I wasn't able to turn in a number of term papers. I have told my psychiatrist about this and he just laughed at me for having poor hygiene, which I think is very unprofessional so I don't want to go back to him. 

Another thing is that I occasionally have vivid suicide thoughts and ideations. I think about dying and ways to achieve it. I didn't do it apparently, but these thoughts sometimes got so overwhelming that I couldn't think about anything else besides dying and I want my brain to shut up. I have again brought this up with my psychiatrist and he said that either I was going to commit suicide actively that I needed to be institutionalised or that I was not suicidal at all. 

There are also issues that I'm not sure whether they're a manifestation of my depression or are symptoms of other mental illnesses. I have always had a negative relationship with food. But around half a year ago, I started binge eating. I eat more foods than necessary to the point that I feel like I'm going to throw up. I try to stop, but I always failed and I'm riddled with guilt. 

Moreover, I am very particular on certain things. I am not a very sensitive person usually (not saying that it's bad but it's how I am). However I could get triggered over really minor things, eg. people moving my things without telling me, people making decisions for me, people touching my things without washing their hands, etc. And I'm especially defensive about my body. During one of my 'shut-down' episodes mentioned earlier, someone (male) in my family said ""I'm going to change your clothes for you"". It immediately triggered me into a very bad meltdown in which I screamed and hit myself constantly. The same said male had also come into the bathroom while I'm showering and I feel very disgusting about myself that caused me to relapse on self-harming. 

The meds (Bupropion &amp; Pristiq mainly) that I'm on aren't doing much and I've taken them long enough that they should've had an effect already. I still have a lack of motivation and depressive thoughts. I have tried to tell my psychiatrist about all these, but I feel like he doesn't understand what I'm saying. They charged by the consultation time so I was very stressed about the bills and I usually wasn't able to cover everything since my depression is caused by trauma and it already took a long time going through it. I had to rush through my experiences and I felt like the doc didn't have a good grasp about my situation. I am not great at explaining my thoughts verbally, so I would like to know if anyone have similar experiences and how you would normally describe them and ask your psychiatrist about diagnoses. Thank you."
depression,"I'm back here. I thought I moved on I have so much stuff swirling in my head once again. Some new stuff, and some old stuff that I never really resolved...

But instead of unloading, I want to try and limit myself. I don't know if it'll help at all, but its really the only good way I can think of venting my thoughts out. Without them being flooded and piled on top of one another.

So. Tonight it came to my mind.
I realize that I don't have anyone to rely on emotionally.
I'm too afraid to reveal my problems to others. Even my mom.

Everytime I open up, my emotions bubble up and broil in a furious wave of swinging moods. I'll be a crying wreck, then I'll be an unrational jerk, sometimes I even laugh at the pain I try to unload. And even with that, I feel like im just making people feel worse. I feel like im forcing them to listen, or making them feel bad on purpose.

I feel so out of touch with my emotions and mind. 

I genuinely can't tell you if my problems and thoughts right now are real or not. I feel insane. And alone. And scared. But I'm almost a 20 year old, who barely even knows their own identity. Both in terms of who I want to be for my purpose, and who I want to be as my gender and personality. I feel like I could switch at any moment, with just the flip of a switch. But maybe I can't find it anymore. Or maybe I'm just crazy and I was never this disturbed mentally.

I just feel so lonely. I remember, thinking that dating would fill that void when I was in highschool, but it always led to problems. Because I wasn't emotionally or mentally ready for one. And I know im not mature enough now.

I just need someone to lean on, to tell me I'll be okay. To tell me to relax, take a deep breath, and truly close my eyes. 

But I have no one.

And I know people online, even if they mean well, won't feel the same as a living, breathing human being, leaning against me and telling me these things. Warmth, softness, kindness, tender hands and openness.

Maybe I have some mommy issues, lol.

I guess I did ramble. I guess that wasn't too bad. I felt like I got something off my chest, even if I can still feel it. It feels lighter. Even if nobody ever sees this, and it get washed away in the endless posts. I don't think I'd mind. Maybe. Lolol.

I want to really smile again."

Should I let her know that I might struggle a lot in school because of my mental health issues? I've only been in this school for two days and I'm not entirely sure if I should trust her, even though the survey says that she'll keep the things you wrote as a secret.

I think now would be the only chance to let her know about it. Maybe she'll be more understanding when I'm having a hard time due to mental health problems?"

depression,"I wanna remember when Kyle died WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

I'm sure a memory will come up and your mother, Trey or even Tyler will reminisce about it for a quick second but then reality snaps back in and they remember that they'll most likely never see that same soul again.

You remember when your mom said she's probably gonna kill herself because she can't stand to see what you've turned into? 

How then that turned into she can no longer have a peaceful night's sleep, so in order for her to continue to live her life she's gonna have to pretend like you're dead ? 

How about when after the first of March comes around your father told you that you will no longer exist to him, that he will turn a blind eye to you even if you pass by him on the street . ""Sorry son I have a life to live I got things I gotta do and I'm not gonna have you be a setback, hurry up and figure it out you fucking loser.""

depression,"I am distant, from what people perceive as world. I feel alone. Hi all of you.

I dont think, sometimes, depression actually exist. I think its an easy way to label something in a way to let it seem something to cure, when the thing to cure is humans, us, as society. Depression means to me being deeply aware. Sure not all of the personal stories are the same, and I might be wrong.

I feel like this because me family story was too much, I grew up being bullied by everyone, at work, at school. I was always labelled as a person that is ""too concerned"" that ""thinks too much"" ""not able to appreciate good things""... whenever I would have the courage to say something it was me being wrong. For caring about any kind of rights in the work place, for saying something about politics, for being involved in the big structure of this world.

I see the patterns because I know my story, I see every pain in this world, connected and I see the reason is probably that human nature just sucks. I just see it.

&amp;#x200B;

I see the distance between me and anyone. People like to get to know me, cause I seem interesting in the beginning, than, when I used to still open up to people sometimes... they would be scared, I see how scared they are. Its because I am lucid, in my analyse. I am passionate about history, about philosophy, even if I was and I am poor af. I Always struggled to be at what for everyone around me was a 0 point, a point of start. Reading, let me understand that my thoughts were already in someone elses mind before I was even intended to be born... that kept me feeling less alone, for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry, what I wrote is messy, pointless, as I am in the end. I tried I try everyday to look at the good things, I simply dont think there's any reason to have fought so much and have nothing. Be nothing. I would love to have a dog, I cannot afford it. I am 31. I am asking myself everyday, why, why I have to feel all of it.

depression,"Desire to self-sabotage. I don't feel like I deserve success. I don't know why but I always feel like I don't deserve to do great in life. It feels like it would be terrible for me to succeed despite wanting it so bad. It's as if I'm my own worst enemy.

For instance, I want to have good grades, but somehow I feel like I don't deserve it, and because of that thought process, I slack off. I honestly don't understand the possible root causes of this mindset, but I'm pretty sure it's tied to my depression. 

Has anyone experienced this as well, and know how to resolve this mindset? I don't want to live like this anymore."

I'm not usually a depressed person. Usually twice a year I'll get really bad. 

But usually once a month I'll get extremely depressed for a few days and even sucicial but it goes away.

For the past month it hasn't gone away. 
I live with 2 other girls, we sre all in college. 
One of them has been so mean to me lately, getting mad bc I organized our fridge, getting mad bc I threw out moldy fruit and veggies and food that expired in October. And she gets mad bc I have my boyfriend over when our bedrooms are opposite of the apartment and he NEVER goes into the common area and we are very quiet. 

She won't even look at me, talk to me, she slams doors, hides items that we share such as brooms etc. And today I tried to talk to her and she didn't even look at me or barley speak. 

I'm so depressed I don't go to classes anymore I don't do my homework, I barley shower, get dressed, eat, sleep etc. 

I have no idea what to do."
depression,"How do people wake up and feel happy about life It's true that life is what you make of it. But why do we bother making anything of it. Everything feels so pointless. The thing I really can't wrap my head around is why we're all told that we have to make something great of ourselves when we grow up. Sure, I have aspirations for my future. Not because I want to. Because I don't want to be seen as a worthless part of society and seen as a lazy bag of shit by my family. I'm a complete underachiever and will never reach my goal in a million years, which just makes me feel even more hopeless. I don't want to think about it. Every time I do, it feels like my whole body is overcome with dread. Maybe I'm fucking delusional but why have we, a few living organisms on a floating rock shrouded in the vastness of space, managed to develop such fucking backward ideologies."
depression,"Self love I know that my biggest weakness is the hate i have for myself. I can't go like a single minute without thinking tjat someone is looking at me saying im ugly (even if that has never happened)

Maybe anyone here who have felt the same could give me some advice?"

I'm not scared about being depressed, I'm worried weather I'll be able to handle talking about it. I've never been able to control my anger and end up crying after telling. 

I've tried to talk about it a bit, but I usually chicken out and just say it was a momentary thing. But it's not. It's everyday. Every night."

I've tried having other friendships too but when I get close to people it seems they either leave because of my disorders and can't handle it or I push them away because they were just using me.
There's no point to having people in your life when nobody stays long.
I'm scared of attachment and when I get too close it's at that point it feels like that's when they push me away...

The last 3 years there have been only 2 good friends I consider close (not including my best friend but he lives far away) and I feel that they are the only people that care more than others but I also feel like such a leech on their lives. I can tell at times they distance themselves a bit and maybe it's the sign they will leave too.

I'm better off being a loner with pets."
depression,I’m tired and done I have had a rough time. Life feels like a cracked cup that fails to have fulfillment. I have had Tourette’s for 4 months now and I can’t sleep because of it. I can’t find a neurologist that will accept my insurance so I can get a diagnosis to help with my depression. Being completely honest if I can’t find help quick idk if I’ll be here next year. My older sister who was my literal best friend died in a car wreck about 6 years now. The nightmares I have every week of her dead in her casket haunts me. The screams from my family when we found out that morning still echoes in my head. I’ve been going to therapy to try to help but I can’t find a escape from the pain. I was diagnosed with severe PTSD. This past summer was another horrible time. My mother had a psychotic break from starving herself and taking to much pain killers that she was addicted to. Fast forward I find her almost dead on our sidewalk. I couldn’t feel her pulse and she was limp. I yelled for my dad to call 9/11 and I remembered yelling to my sisters to go inside because I didn’t want them to see their lifeless mom and their screams and cry’s fuck with me. I was about to administer CPR but out of a stroke of luck the town ambulance just so happened to be driving down our street and they saved her life. Idk what life is anymore and I don’t know if I’m going to live that long. Thank you to anyone that read this. I just needed to vent because I felt like I was gonna do something I can’t walk away from.
depression,"I fell like I can't live on anymore.  Everything that gave my life meaning has vanished. There is nothing more in this world for me. I actually want to kill myself because of this. I wish I did sooner. I turned 18 recently and I don't think people will consider it a teen suicide if I'm legally an adult. It's a shame because I've been feeling this way since I was 15. I wish I would have killed myself then. I would have been younger and people would have had more sympathy.

That's what I want more than anything. sympathy. I want my pain to be remembered and known. I want those who have wronged me to get some sort of karma. Not by getting locked up in jail or anything like that. Freedom of speech and all that. Just by being exposed for who they were and having the world know about the pain they caused me.

I guess if I do kick the bucket I want a few things to be known. For starters, I have intrusive thoughts and ocd. This causes me to have these irrational fears that my thoughts control reality and shit. It has really debilitated my quality of life.

I have an iffy relationship with my mom. I feel like she's never there for me and always holds everything I say and do against me. She makes me feel guilty and worthless and has always had a short temper. She does apologize and love me sometimes but it's always after an outburst.

I have an equally hard relationship with my half-siblings. They're much older than me so we never really had a chance to grow up together. My sister has autism so she's been hard to live with. My brother and I got along a bit better but he's had his fair share of problems so we never got a chance to really bond with each other. Although I do have fond memories of watching him play Turock and Doom on his N64. Overall I guess I'm just lonely. Besides my Dad, I don't feel like I have any real family to rely on.

Speaking of my Dad, he's great. I feel like I abuse his kindness and love. He always lets me vent to him and has never judged me for anything. Yet here I am being a lazy ass who does nothing but mooch of his money.

I've failed at everything I've tried at. I used to be so optimistic and determined. Now I'm just cynical and unmotivated. To be honest I thought I would be fit as hell by now. But I'm just fat and ugly. It's a shame. I used to be fairly attractive. But I've been kinda a slob and have had an inconsistent diet. So that's caused me to lose some of my looks. I just miss when I was a bit of a womanizer. I remember it wasn't uncommon to have girls have notable crushes on me. I might have asked some of them out if I had the self-confidence. I've never been good with people ya see. I always end up saying or doing something stupid to screw up the whole relationship.

Speaking of which, I don't really have any friends. Most pepole that live in the area I either lose touch with or they move away.  they're a few people out of state I know but we don't really talk much anymore. 

Also, while I'm probably being a bit paranoid I feel like I've act so weird that I push pepole away. But can ya blame me? I always end up losing friends. So I feel like I have to try hard not to look like an imbecile.

I guess that originates from this one toxic environment I was in. I was a part of this youth organization that had these different ranks. To impress the older guys including one person I looked up to I rapidly climbed the ranks to get to the top. Well, it turns out they were mad that I was ranking up so quickly and started chastising me. Especially the person I looked up to. He was the whole reason I joined that chapter. I wanted him to get to know me and become my friend. But instead, he and everyone else made me feel like human trash. They said I was immature and didn't let me into the group activities. This broke me. While I've always been kinda self-conscious they really took a blow to my self-esteem and made me feel like a shit human being.

To be fair I was able to shrug this whole part about friendship off before I became depressed. But since then I think it's really occurred to me how alone I am in this world.

I also can't enjoy games anymore. It's a bit of a story so read my previous post if you're interested. But basically, a group of people I've encountered has slowly but surely sucked the fun out of gaming and made me feel like I have shit taste. Now I can't enjoy games anymore. It's a shame. It was a big hobby of mine. It got me through some rough patches in my life. But now it's gone. The shame is there were so many more games I wanted to play. I only got about two years to play adult games before I became depressed. It's sad. Besides strategy games like CIV and Plague Inc, I usually like narrative and character-driven games. And I only played four. All the modern single-player Fallout games and this other one called We Happy Few. There are so many other games like The Last of Us, The Walking Dead, RDR, Bioshock, and so many more that I will never get to play.

All in all, this is what I want people to know. It's also one of the reasons I want to kill myself. I want people to hear about me and my pain. I don't want it to be forgotten. I know that's mighty selfish of me. There are people in this world who have it much worse than me. I guess we all need the love and attention we deserve. And I want my own slice of it. Again I don't think anyone will care about me now that I'm 18. From there I'll turn from a depressed suicidal teen to a lonely adult. And no one ever cares about a lonely adult. I also feel like I've wasted my adolescence. Again I've been feeling like this since I was 15.

I really wish I ended it all sooner. The only reason I'm still alive is that I'm a coward. I don't even have the courage to call the suicide hotline. Let alone hang myself. If you scroll far enough back in my account you'll find a bunch of suicide notes. I've also had the same suicide note on my computer ready for my parents to read. I would even have the bathtub ready for me to drown myself. But I always chickened out. I guess it's because of the fear of pain. Whether it is drowning or suffocation dying really hurts when you inflict it upon yourself.  I would overdose on drugs but my parents have hidden my medication from me.

I know this is an awful lot of Info to tell strangers on the Internet. That's largely because I have no one else in my life to talk to. I feel so alone. I just can't live life anymore. It all seems trivial now. I'd kill myself but it just to painful. It seems like the only escape from this hell I've been in for the last couple of years. It's also the only way I can get people to listen to me. At Least it was when I was younger.

That's all I guess. Thanks for listening. I'm sorry if this came across too melodramatic. It's just genuinely how I feel and I want people to understand. I also know some of this stuff seems vulgar. I don't know if this sub is still fine with pepole talking about suicidal thoughts. I got a warning for threatening violence for posting something on another sub so I hope that doesn't repeat itself here."

No, I kind of feel like I absolutely will get rich or die trying. And idk. Life’s just weird right now. Still a kid but almost not a kid anymore. Or what if we’re always kids and we don’t have to “grow up”. Hmm"

depression,"I do not know what to do Hi, I... I don't know what to do, I'm lost, I don't even know what I'm doing writing this nonsense but I think I don't have any options I don't even have a reason to feel like this, I have everything but I feel totally empty, I can't find any motivation, I live my life so boring and monotonous, it's like I see everything gray but... I don't understand why, I have a complete and healthy family, my friends, few but there they are trying to support me, I have a special boyfriend That tries to support me at all times, I'm at university, not in the career I wanted but I'm still studying, although I no longer find reasons to try to achieve something, I lost all motivation 4 years ago , everything that made me continue with some light in my eyes but it's gone, I'm tired of feeling like this, it's like living my own life but without being able to do anything, this post is just an attempt to I vent but it doesn't even make any sense, I've thought about suicide a lot but the last time I tried it it worried my family too much that I don't even feel like trying anymore, I don't know if it's better to end this or continue living the way I live, I've spoiled everything good I had, my skin is very marked and I don't see anything beautiful in myself anymore... none of this Makes sense."
depression,Last two nights I woke up having a panic attack Waking up to live this life is like groundhog day. A nightmare.
depression,"Bully, hate and jealous. How to deal with it ? Hey guys I just want to ask you a question related why people hate me jealous of me. I don't even harm them but people still hate me. I'm an introvert guy and I love being private and I'm an artist by profession and whenever I get alone time i try to learn new skills. I use to have few friends and now they hate! Why I don't know? They always in peer pressure but I don't believe in this! As I said I always love my alone time and explore new skills. They always try to invade my  life and I hate this. And I used to be in depression related to this thing's. They are in group and sometime they even bully me and I even had many fights and now I can't concentrate on my career. I'm 23 now and still don't know how to figure out and deal with this. 

 : Sorry for my bad English."
depression,"“Lens of loss” I saw something recently that made me realize why I have such an existentialist/depressing outlook on life. I view life through the lens of loss rather than the lens of gain. Every birthday I’m not “gaining age yay” I’m losing a year and mourning the loss of my younger self. When I went to college I didn’t look at it like I was gaining new friends/experiences I looked at it like I was losing all of my connections from high school. I could go on and on with examples.

But my issue is I have ALWAYS looked at life this way. It’s not something that started when I developed depression, I’ve been intensely nostalgic to the point of pain for as long as I can remember… and I don’t understand how people don’t think like this. I can’t look at a photo from years ago and smile, I always cry, thinking about how much has changed. Even if it was for the better. Does anyone else do this?"
depression,"i fucking hate this. I've been on meds for about a year now, and they helped with the worst of it. But sometimes I just get these episodes where I feel like I'm hit with a freight train of depression and I don't know how to fucking deal with it. Every time it happens it feels like I'm starting from the beginning , and it like forgotten how it feels, and its just a miserable experience. Normally if I'm lucky, it only last few hours. But this episode is now going onto day 2 and I don't know how to cope. I just want it to stop. anyways , sorry for the rant , I just have no one to talk to about these feelings"
depression,"Woke up feeling like sh*t for no particular reason… I mean, other than the usual ones. I’m alone, I have no friends, I hate the way I look, my ex is with a new girl that he literally treats like a princess ( he always treated ME like garbage and left me with about a million insecurities about myself ), bla bla bla… and I feel like I just hate everything and everyone, nothing can cheer me up and I just HATE being alive and conscious. Can anyone relate?"
depression,"Help Something traumatic happened to me last year, and I no longer feel like myself. I feel so overwhelmed with my emotions and I don't know how to control them anymore. I tried to kill myself and after I did it i chickened out, so I was left there bleeding out and having my family around me calling for an ambulance. As I laid there drunk and bleeding out, I thought a lot about my life and I hate it. I physically hate being alive and breathing. And everyone around me is just telling me to get help like it will sort everything out. I've thought about repeating it several thousand times since but i don't want to leave my family with debt that they can't pay. 
What I need is for some advice.
I need not to feel anything anymore otherwise I will end up cutting myself again.
Does anyone know of anything that I could take that would get rid of how im feeling. I don't care if I get addicted to it. It just can't be hard drugs like heroin or cocain. I've tried weed but it just makes me feel sick to my stomach and that not what I want. I just want to stop this pain in my chest and not feel anymore emotions. I'm not interested in getting help or going doctors as I've already done that and they've given me antidepressants and they haven't done anything to help, I've been to therapy and it's all breathing exercises and I know how to breathe. It's the one thing I'm starting to hate doing. I live in the UK so laws are stricter and so are prescription drugs. Does anyone know anything that could help me, please I'm begging."
depression,Will I ever find love or should I just give up So I used to self harm im 4 months clean but I have alot of cuts and I have had one suicide attempt I was doing better in life I wanted to start dating but that stopped me because of my past my question is it worth dating again will I find some that will love me even if my past was bad or should I forget I know that dating nowadays is very hard (male 20) idk what do you think
depression,"How do I even do my homework when I keep crying? I didn’t attend any of my zoom classes today.

I didn’t do homework.

I barely ate.

I stayed in bed all day.

I just keep and keep finding that  all my experiences in life point to me being worthless. I'll never in my life be good enough. There's nothing to look forward to life because I'll always always be a complete failure."
depression,"Another night of suicidal thoughts. I live by myself and moved to a brand new city 8 months ago. 

I need this pattern of sadness to stop, and I do what I can to manage it. I go to therapy. 

But time and time again, sometimes I just decide the world is too much for me to want to be in anymore and I don't want to have to be up at night crying like this anymore. It's just gotten to the point where I'm not even depressed I'm just simply exhausted of the night after night, day after day, continuous depression. I am just tired of it and want it to end."
depression,"i hate who mental illness has turned me into (f18) i’ve always thought people with mental illness were the most kind and empathetic because they know how it feels to suffer. i was like that a couple years into my depression, but over time, i’ve become bitter, irritated and apathetic. i hate it. it makes me feel worse about myself than i ever have in my life. i feel like it’s because i’m so deeply unhappy that i’m just shut off to peoples problems most of the time and i can’t figure out how to fix it. i try to improve my mental illness by trying to replace bad thought patterns, going to the gym, reading, eating better, having goals in life, but at the end of the night when i’m laying in bed, i’m always just so sad and hopeless. i’ve lost faith in people almost entirely and all my friendships are strained. i’ve gained 40 pounds in a year after a bad “break up” after i’d finally lost weight successfully and healthily and i am in a bad place financially. every time something good happens or i make a good decision, something bad ALWAYS happens. i’ve learned to expect it. thats probably a problem in itself and i know i should try to think more positively, but it feels like there’s nothing positive to think about. the world feels so grey and time moves faster than i can cope with. i know i’m young and technically haven’t truly lived, but my life from the age of 6 has truly just felt like torture. i feels like i’ve never just had a minute to breathe. everything just makes me want to crawl in my bed under my blankets and just sleep forever. i’m not entirely sure why i’m posting this, i don’t have many people to talk to i guess. id like to hear from anyone who has advice, or from anyone who’s felt/is feeling similar and has some tips."
depression,"What brings happiness and self love? Hey, hope everyone is doing well, I’m a 17 (near 18) years old guy and I’m dealing with depression and I’m currently using medication for it and also have a therapist but what I’m really struggling in is finding a reason to be happy or a reason to love myself, I thought maybe if I had a gf it could help but unfortunately I had zero luck there too and in my country the guy should take the first step to make a relationship and it’s just hard cause schools in my country are all-boy/girl so in school I only have guys and like I go to a park and I even hug the cats in the park but I never could just say to a girl that I like her and I want to know her more, oh and one bad thing is I’m really behind study wise and that isn’t good for someone like me that has perfectionist problems, I sometimes feel like the world would not care If I die and I’m considering it, anyway just a simple question what brings happiness and self love?

depression,I'm concerned about this being depression For the last 3 years I haven't felt right. Some nights I wake up from really vivid dreams and anxiety attacks. Throughout the day I feel empty and anxious at times. My appetite is fine. I still have a job and keep myself busy. I had this checked out before and didn't get answers.
depression,"Getting better would require an amount of effort and pain I am not willing to put in Putting aside the question of whether it's even feasible, I am so mentally broken that it would take years of therapy, some amount of luck and really hard work for me to become anything resembling a ""normal"" person. 

And with what goal? Still feeling sad and bored on the regular? Happiness is fleeting, even at the best of times. And the older you get, the higher the chances you'll die in pain and alone.

My only dreams are things I won't be able to achieve. There's nothing for me to work towards. The only reason I put in any effort at all is because I have to."

depression,"Understanding emotions after(?) depression I stopped therapy for depression in 2018, when I was 17, because I thought I cured it, and was happy, but I just watched a show recently that made me think, and, I don't think I am or was happy, I think I just...convinced myself emptiness *was* happiness, since it seemed better than sadness at the time...but looking back, feeling *something* was better. Since 2018, I honestly don't think I've felt sad, or happy, or much of anything. I think the only feeling I've actually ***felt*** since then was anger and sadness, at normal amounts.

Often it just feels like I just don't understand what I'm feeling, like I'm empty. If someone asks how I am, obviously I throw the typical ""alright"" at them, but if they dig deeper, or if I try to dig deeper, I honestly can't figure out what I'm feeling. The feeling isn't *nothing,* there's *something* there, I just...can't figure out what it is. When I was in therapy, I described how I felt as a ""cloud of sadness"", and honestly, that's what it's like *all* the time, just with all the other emotions instead. 

Since then, I mean I ""have"" those emotions I suppose, they just feel...well...weak, like the cloud analogy. Like for happy, I could *know* I'm happy by the surroundings, and slight better feeling that the empty, but I don't *feel* happy, still empty, nothing near the feeling of anger, or even sadness pre-2018. Could that be a mixed side effect of adhd *and* depression? Is it that I never *learned* how to feel other emotions growing up, since I, for all I know, grew up always having depression? Or...is emptiness just what everyone experiences all the time?"
depression,Goodbye maddi There's this girl right. She is everything to me and I used to think she was perfect in every way. I would have done anything for her. Yes anything. But come to find out she could care less about me. She filled my head with these stories and promises that had me ready and willing to go to war for this girl at any moment. But come to find out she doesn't feel the same about me at all and will never come true with the things she has told me. As of lately she has shown me that she could give a fuck less and that she hates my existence. She always wants to fight and be very mean and disrespectful. I don't think she realizes the amount of damage she's done to my heart. I truly think she won't even care when I'm gone. There's a lot of stress in my life right now that's crippling my give a fuck. Now my only worries are who am I gonna take down with me.
depression,"Depression or Laziness? So.. constantly I look around my environment and I want to clean so badly or start cooking or drawing or playing games anything.. but i end up just lying in bed the whole time and watch videos..I love going out though when it’s places I want to go but usually I end up going out in pjs or sweatpants and a simple shirt even though the other day I had said I was gonna dress up pretty and maybe do my makeup.. When I try explaining the way I feel to my family, I feel like I’m just making excuses for being lazy but it never feels like that..maybe? I just can’t bring myself to do any of it even the things I enjoy..Sometimes I cry at night because I realize I don’t do anything at all and people must think I’m just a lazy bum; which in reality, I guess, I am.. Im so frustrated with myself I’ve even tried making lists of what to do on a daily bases even simple things like drink water, make breakfast etc but I never seem to stick with it for more than a week at most.. What the heck am I supposed to do?"

depression,"What is the point of living? Was it fun living? What is the purpose of living while constantly being depressed. Things doesn't goes your way. Friend and family ignored your existence. Every people you meet and talk to suddenly just disappear from you. Fear of suiciding due to instinct of survival. I Can't even end my own life. You don't even have the mood to even do anything. No interest in having meal, going out, doing something you once loved, just nothing. So What is the point of living? Was it fun? Constantly living in pain that you don't even understand and there nothing out there that can saved you from it either. Every effort you put in working toward a happy life just crumble everytime you are rebuilding it. All your effort are unrecognised. So Was it fun living? So Please give me courage and reason to take my own life please. So that I don't have to think about all these fuckery anymore and just die. What is the point of living when everyone has everything that you don't and they just look at you and be like oh, you have nothing but life is fucking good to me. Look what I have. Only ended up knowing you won't have anything good out of ""life"". Being lonely was fun and staying depressed was a bonus too. So please let me die."

They hate me for speaking up. They hate me for expressing my emotions. Every fucking day my grandmother is either sick or my uncle is being the abusive narc he is. God why can't i have a proper family.

depression,"I feel like I am destined to kill myself It's so fucking funny. Why is my life //so// messed up??? It was bad enough at 7, it is worse at 17.

depression,"I fell in love for the first time in my life Kinda strange title for this sub but it should still fit in this community. 

Im 21 and had strong depressions in the age of 17-21. I wanted to kill myself, I felt sick everyday and i even got panic attacks because i told myself that I'm really ugly. I quit my Job and went back to school, after that my depressions got better. I only felt like once or twice a week bad and this surprised me so much. I felt like im not sick everyday and it kinda scared me to wake up without this depressed feeling i had for years, every single day. 

Now to the point why i post this. I'm 21 and I never was loved, okay my parents love me but they kinda have to. I mean like someone else who you didn't know before. Also I was a very cold person, i always felt like I didn't have emotions, I thought I couldn't love. I always played this scenario in my mind how my mom would die and i really wouldn't care. It just felt like nothing . But then, i met this girl ( i never had a girlfriend before btw.) we chatted and everything seemed fine. She is pretty, for real she is a really pretty girl. At this point it gets crazy for me personally because I always thought im ugly and no one could love me but then this girl just appeared in my life and something changed. The first time in my life someone said how good I look and I felt something like never before. If the person you are attracted to, cares about you and tells you compliments, that  is the best thing in my life that happened. We started dating and I just caught myself how i stared at her face and I just realized that i love someone .Since I have never felt this feeling before, this is so overwhelming for me.

I hope everyone who is depressed right now and reads this will get his happy turn in his life. I'm not fully healed but I am kinda happy now and i could never have imagined to be happy 2 years ago. Life will change guys and I mean look at me, I'm experiencing something what i should have experienced as a teenager with 21 years . 

Life will change, one day you will get rewarded for the fight you are taking now."
depression,"Feeling trapped I'm sorry for the mistakes, but english is not my first language, and I do not have privacy if I type this out on a PC instead of my phone.

I don't like the fact that this is my second post, but I don't really have anywhere else to put my hopeless thoughts. I am currently taking a stem degree that I have yet to be accepted into, and due to covid, I have been struggling to finish this degree. 

However, the problem resides in my family, who have forced me into this position where I am absolutely miserable every waking moment. I have asian parents, and they had forced me to join my older brother in a country I did not want to move to where I had no friends or any support other than my own brother. He snitches on me about everything I do to my parents and makes fun of me whenever I'm having my depressive episodes to the point where he mocks me to my parents who in turn also mock me and guilt me into thinking my depression is not real. He snitches on me to the point where I am not allowed to enjoy any type of outing with my new friends or anything other than studying.

I have time again and again told them that I hate this degree and the job that I will end up in but they guilt me saying that they have sacrificed so much and are currently suffering for me to be in this position, they are well off and I am pretty sure they are just lying. They see me as a retirement piggy bank rather than a daughter who dreams about passing away to avoid the disappointment of my parents. It is also not like they cannot survive without me supporting them; they are just embarrassed of me if I pursued my dreams of being a graphic designer or anything lesser than a doctor.

What is worse is that they gave me a timeframe of 2 years to finish my degree even though it takes almost everyone about 6 years to finish it. Everytime a year passes by, they make sure I suffer. My brother is currently unemployed and does not make an effort to find a job. He is moving in with them next month because of his laziness and lack of drive to find a job. Yet, he is treated like a son, whereas I am continued to be kicked to the side of the dirt and told how useless of a daughter I am. 

Today, I failed an exam, and I broke down crying because I knew I will never be good enough. I have a meeting with a therapist that I set up for myself because my parents do not believe in mental illness, and I have started to feel as if therapy is not helping. Nothing helps. I am lost; I am hopeless. I wanted to stick through this degree and job till the day I become a graphic designer, but that day seems so far away as I am forced to continue this years long imprisonment. 

The only thing helping me move forward is my beloved boyfriend. I love him, and he supports me through and through, but my parents refuse to acknowledge him and refer to him as 'my friend'. They even told me to just marry him and take advantage of him by divorcing him afterward. When I obviously rejected that idea, they spat at me, saying: ""You think you live in a fairytale? This is real life."" My mother had pleaded not to move in with him or even have a boyfriend in the first place because I would no longer be considered 'pure'. I hate this."

Just  to leave some kind of hurt behind in protest  of what was done to me. I have moments  where I rejoice  in the thought of watching the whole world burn to the ground, but I'm to defeated to strike a match.

depression,"Can someone relate? I was feeling ok-ish for the last few weeks, months even. But I already feel a deep sadness coming back now and then. I have exams coming up and absolutely no motivation for anything. 
I barely managed to eat and shower yesterday. Today I woke up and had a slight spark of motivation so I wanted to instantly start learning before it goes away. Then I made a mistake and looked at my phone. What I saw were 3 missed calls and 10 messages from my mum including a voicemail in which she shouts and is absolutely hysterical because I didn’t answer within an hour. Shouting and crying and telling me how worthless I am because she had to wait a bit for help with a laptop problem. 
Now my motivation is gone, as well as those last moments of feeling ok-ish. 
I just wanna pass my exams so I can go back to not doing anything again."
depression,"Something just doesn’t feel right I’ve been feeling very on and off. I have “normal” days and then on some mornings I can’t even find strength to get out of bed. I’ve tried journaling, self help books, painting. But these only work in the moment and soon after I start feeling weird again. Im not able to ask for help because I can’t really put it into words what I’m actually feeling. I just feel like shit. How do I fix this. How do I fix me. I’ve been told things happen for your good and the universe is working for your best but I just can’t see that right now."
depression,I'm a burden My existence is a burden to others. I always worry when asking people for help because I feel like I'm too much and I'm being a burden. Sometimes I don't ask questions just so I wouldn't burden them for being so dumb and stupid. I even wanted to cut the word 'burden' on my thighs. Some told me that I'm too exhausting and too overwhelming. I think they would be better off without me. Why should I even live if I'm just a damn burden. I'm not good enough to not become a burden.
depression,"Feeling like my life peaked at 30 I was engaged to a gorgeous woman who I loved and was proud of. I had a job that had me flying all over the US about two or three times a month. I had a house with a dog and a yard. We were planning on children, which I wanted so badly.

The pandemic happened. She couldn't stand being home with me so the engagement ended. I moved home to be with my dad since I needed the company and so did he since his wife died. I feel like I can't leave because of his condition. Travel for work ceased, so I'm just a schmuck cranking out work on a computer. I'm grateful for the work, but it's less prestige even with the same job.

I've tried dating again. Online dating is completely removed from any ""story"" which makes bonding very difficult. I have a personality that requires time to ""grow on"" people, but in the world post-graduation with 30-second first impressionsx without a campus where people gather and regularly see each other, I feel like it's a losing battle.

I feel like these setbacks alone don't explain why I'm so miserable, but it hit me recently: I can't visualize things getting as good or better than they were. I'm not so sad that I stop working and existing, but I'm not working *towards* anything. My life was so great 2 years ago that it seems like a pipe dream to try and get to the same level. I peaked."

I never want to think of you ever again

I should be getting around the city, partying, going out to eat. I’m eating myself to death, restricting, and repeat.

depression,"Memories Hi people,

I was just wondering if anyone has got any ideas on how to move forward from cringe memories and things that happened in the past. I have nearly 24hr intrusive memories that ruin my day about something I might have said or done 25 years ago. 

They just will not stop. 

I have epilepsy and damage to the temporal lobe which means I'm on 40mg citalopram to control mood.

Overall I'm good but I'm crashing at the moment and I just struggle to move past these fucking events that just don't matter. 

I shout to myself the old ""rent free"". But it doesnt help. 

I'm permanently battling just to get through and I'm so tired of it. 

PS they are so numerous councilling would take 20 years to talk through them. it's almost like every action I take is the wrong one and becomes a bad memory or decision."
depression,"I'm not a real person and I live in constant fear of being found out I have always felt fundamentally incomplete and ""empty"". I've always equated it to not having the same core of humanity that other people have. It's as if I was hollowed out so that, despite appearing human on the outside, on the inside I am this hideous subhuman facsimile that is fundamentally unlovable, unwanted and untoward. I lack passion, a full breadth of emotions, sentimentality - basically just humanity.

I've gotten good at hiding this fact. I'm superficially quite charming and friendly. At a glance I can pass for a full fledged human, but I live in constant fear that people will see through my facade and know that I am this twisted, gnarled abomination. They'll see just how truly ugly I am and reject me, and they'd be fully entitled to do so.

depression,Same old same old Had an interview today I believe I messed it up again an interview that came after so many years of applications that went unanswered I think my image of myself tempers with my confidence I can't go into interviews with the expected zeal.

depression,"Non-mentally ill people just don't get it I'm so tired of all the ""you'll be happy again"" posts. They just don't get it. I've been depressed for most of my life and I have ADHD on top of that, which doesn't have a cure. Genetics are cursed and sometimes you're born with a broken brain, and neurotypicals just don't get it."

depression,"Mourning the loss... Why does it hurt so much to let go of someone you love when you know they are not good for you?
How do I now mourn the loss of the man I thought I knew?

He said it himself he would choose his Alcohol over me and would never stop...I see his priorities..

Then turns around to act like I didn’t ask, that I didn’t give him warning after warning and chance after chance to at least learn to moderate his consumption, that I didn’t give him an ultimatum..

I fucking loved him and now the man I see isn’t him anymore, its a hollowed out man with nothing but rage and hatred in his heart...

He dismisses all the work that I DID do, all the efforts I put into this relationship an trying to fucking make it work but did nothing but make it worse...

Im having to watch him essentially die, to watch as the person I once knew just slip away and disappear into the nothing...

He acts like I didn’t fucking love him and guilt trip me into taking him back only to be met with this same ugly form of empty promises and disrespect...

He acts as if me just now becoming cold over so many years and so many chances is not right, that I am the bad person cause I cant love an alcoholic slob who basically wants a walking sex doll thats also his fucking maid. He will cry for equality and say this relationship was 50/50 but when it came to doing anything else other then coming home from work, getting shit faced while playing video games and not contributing to the actual upkeep to the house what so ever...

He acts like my behaviors are unjustified in how I cant control how I feel about him now that he is no longer the person I once loved. Yells at me for being physically cold to him and not wanting to be physically with him for the first god damn time in HISTORY when I have finally put my foot down and had enough!!!!

Im so fucking sick of this...I don’t want to do this anymore..."
depression,"Empty I’m so tired of feeling empty inside. There’s no excitement to life. It’s the same thing every day. Is this really all there is? I’ve got nothing to look forward to. I shouldn’t feel this way but I can’t help it. From the outside you’d think I had everything. But nobody’s looking. I’ve got no friends, my family doesn’t call. Most days I feel like it’s just me and myself."
depression,"Some advice pls Not sure if there is anyone else out there going through this but my best friend is probably the prettiest girl at school, who happens to have pretty much a perfect personality as well. She is a great friend and most of the time really humble about how much male attention she gets, but for the past two years my self esteem has been quite bad because I always feel like the DUFF around her. Recently most of our conversations have shifted to how 10+ guys have been hitting on her and a lot of talk about how attractive she looks. The tone in which she narrates what compliments guys have been giving her is starting to feel a bit cocky tbh. On text as well she is starting to ignore any problems I’m going through and talking to her about in the chat, and straight away starts filling me in on her interactions with guys after a night out (that I’m absent for), making me feel like my problems are not as important as her outings and compliments she’s received. 

But when this happens I have always put on a happy face and hyped her up, kept the attention on her because I don’t want to seem unsupportive or salty but it’s gotten to a point where if we are out together all the guys instantly bro zone me and ask me to wingwoman them so they can get with her. She will also not go anywhere without me in terms of parties and social events so I always seem like her puppet. When guys aren’t talking to her she has me to keep her company. When they do make a move I’m navigating on my own. But the complexity of this issue is that she is genuinely a really good friend most of the time and there isn’t a way for me to unfriend or distance myself from her without seeming out of line. We don’t really have a friendship group so it’s unlikely that I can stick to other girls at parties but if I did choose to hangout with other people on my own more frequently, she knows all my friends and would feel left out, and ask me. I have been feeling quite insecure for ages now and need some advice on how I can feel better about myself or even just changing my perspective on this issue. The good old guys will use her and leave her scenario isn’t applicable here because she has arguable one of the funnest personalities as well. It will be raining meatballs if one day she gets ghosted or dumped."
depression,"Can’t even sleep properly anymore I wish I could sleep for long periods of time but my problems have me more anxious than ever, I wish I never tried penile enlargement"
depression,"Am I pathetic? I’m miserable. I’m not going to, but I want to kill myself. And I feel like my reason for wanting to kill myself is dumb.

For starters is my crush I don’t know too well. I’m 18 by the way, she’s 18, we both work at the same place. I asked her out a few weeks ago. I’m not too sure what the answer was. She said she would’ve loved to have hung out with my dumb ass at a party she couldn’t come to. When I asked her if she wanted to come out some other time she kind of hesitated for a second but then said yeah. And then when I asked her if she actually want to, (I’m a dumbass, I know) I tuned out because I was so nervous and didn’t actually hear what she said, but her body language and facial expression indicated negative. I don’t know what to do now but I saw her the last couple of days and didn’t say a word to her out of both fear of talking to her specifically and the fact that I can’t hold a conversation to save my life in general. So there’s that.

I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. This is my second year out of school and I still have absolutely no idea what to do with myself or my future. I work at Target and I’m genuinely happy working there, but working at Target a casual job at Target isn’t going to be enough for me in the future. It’s not even enough for me now. I’m happy there, but I want more to my life than just working, playing video games and masturbating. I’m not even happy playing video games anymore.

I always wanted to work in movies, but I feel like I wasn’t exactly setup for that being born in West Australia. It’s the only career I’d have any interest in, but I almost don’t have any chance of getting into it. And I’m scared I’m not going to ever be truly happy with anything other than that.

I think my mum might think I’m a bit of a disappointment. She loves me, but on the weekend her friends came over and I could hear her using me as an example for their son to pay attention in school, because I was terrible in school and now I’m working at Target. That kind of hurt. I don’t know if working an obviously not what I plan on doing for the rest of my life casual job at Target is unusual for an 18 year old. Maybe I should be in a better position right now, I don’t know. 

That’s about it for now. I’m sure I could think of a lot more things to complain about, but this is already too long. But this is the main stuff, which brings me back to my question, it this pathetic to feel this way about this stuff? Am I a pathetic person? Because if I am I feel like I at least deserve to know that I am. 

I just want the answers to all my problems. I want someone to tell me what to do and exactly how to fucking do it. Please, please someone tell me what to do. Thank you."
depression,"Can you actually get better without some help? So idk i am depressed for years now, alot of times wanted to end my life but decided not to and to atleast give this life a try.

My life long goals are being threatened at this point, I didn’t care about much else but this and I somehow managed to sabotage it potentially, so there’s no goal for me to reach anymore. My goals were what got me through hard times, I always had hope. Like I won’t be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor. Waiting to see a doctor in these times of Covid is killing me."

The tv would be on in the background and i'd watch but rarely ever move to get up for water or use the toilet or eat.

But I recently noticed I really have no interest, nothing that I can go to that helps me other then taking my kids to the park and just being outside. I enjoy singing but don't play no instruments. What helps you? I would really like to try new things To help get through that  time. My kids and boyfriend deserve a happy mom. 😊"

depression,"How can i help this depressed Person? Soo i have this girl in my class. Shes been in my class for 2 years, so basically we only know each other through lockdown and dont have contact outside of school. But during free lessons we are the only ones going to eat something so we just kinda talk to each other. I started talking about my history mobbing and depression and stuff and she said she can relate to that. Ever since then shes been comfortable to talk to me about this subject. But only ever in school. 

A few weeks ago she said that she didnt go to her horse for an entire week even though that horse means the world to her, and how she kinda stopped seeing an sense in what shes doing. I wrote her that evening and asked if she went to see her horse today, and that she really should go, just to do SOMETHING and not just sit around to do nothing, because that doesnt change anything. 

Thats where my struggle sets in. I dont know her. I never met her outside of school, we dont really have chemistry, and im pretty awkward. I thought about offering to go with her, but it just feels like im not the Person to do that. She has friends that have horses too, i told her to ask them to got with her, but it feels like thats all i can do. I offered to help her with schoolwork, which she refused, and she actually ended up doing it herself, which was good. She also reached out to me one day when she was feeling super down which shows some kind of progress. 

But i still feel like i should do much more. I dont wanna tell her friends about her mental health because that would feel like betraying her trust, but i also dont feel like im in a position where i can really help her. 

Do you have any suggestions what to do?"

It's really hindering my relationship and me as well. Is there any like over the counter medication or simple tricks I can do to remember things? I've tried setting reminders but it doesn't always work. Like for example my SO asked me to go get gas for her last night and not even a minute went by and I forgot, is there anything I could do to prevent stuff like that happening? I just don't have the money to get back to therapy and back on Adderall"
depression,"Why does humanity crave to keep on living and saving lives Some people just don't like living. Some of our lives are just shit. Why do you want for us to keep living and trying if there's no certainty that it will get better. Why is it a societal norm to save every possible life no matter what even if the person whose life is saved doesn't agree with that. This is just fucked up. Truth is it doesn't get better, it always stays the same, it is just the society that is afraid to admit that."

I’ve been depressed and suicidal for the past 8 years. But i finally found peace this year. Found the love of my life and i was like: that’s the girl that i wanna marry.

Shit happens right?

Some genital warts showed up and She is HPV+, and i have it now.

I would never consider this to be a dealbreaker for our relationship. I want her and she wants me. But what now? Should we be going from one clinic to the other? Dealing with the thoughts? What if she gets cancer? Are we truly fucked for good? 

Shit I’m losing it. I’m trying to keep my cool in front of her cause she feels guilty. Telling her it’s nothing to worry about….

, Starving myself for days, Laying in bed and being mentally exhausted , anxiety crippling me to have a normal conversation to a point all I can say is hello and goodbye so I won't be too emotional or angry... Was all just for me. I didn't do it for my mom so she pry nor to my dad so he won't be worried. I didn't even do it for my siblings so they can still lean on me when they're troubled or asked me for help when they're in need. I pushed away my closest friends for myself not for them so they don't carry the burden I feel. I'm done... It's sad that I've tried to tell them I'm not me anymore but they scoffed it off because they thought I was just being overly dramatic. I feel bad for the kid who came today full of bruises and cuts he made himself but I'm jealous that my mom was more emotionally supportive of him then me... I'm lost and tired... I'm done ...

depression,"I don't think I'll ever get to experience life without being ready to die. I can sometimes imagine not constantly wanting to die, when I fantasize about some distant fantastic future where I was able to heal and get the things Id like to have in life. but the readiness to drop dead from any cause will never leave me. I will always have to look everyone in my life in the eyes knowing I would not care if I abandoned them with no warning. what an awful existence."
depression,"Helping my Best Friend with Depression I (20F) have had my own experiences with depression, though it's never been nearly as chronic as my best friend (20NB). I can't possibly understand the depression they experience and especially when ""things get bad"". I've told them that I'm always here for them to listen when they need but they're very closed off emotionally and struggle to put words to how they're feeling. 

At the end of the day, their depression is theirs and I know I can't nor should do that work for them but I do know I can act as a support system if they allow me to be a support system. 

My friend struggles to initiate. And when I say struggles, I mean they rarely do. However, I know they care deeply through the other things they have done for me (remembering small things, being there when I absolutely need them to the best of their ability even if it's not as much as I need). I always feel cared about when I talk to them. But this lack of initiative is taking a toll on me where I can only continue to initiate so much without reciprocation. I *know* things are bad for them right now. I see that because I know my friend and I know that they would never mean to do this on purpose or out of lack of care. But I truly can't help support them if they don't share *how* they are feeling or why they are doing what they do. I believe if I had a better idea of what was going on around them, perhaps I would be more resilient when it came to their lack of initiative. 

I would like some insight from people who have truly been where my friend is at. I also wish to know what you wish your friend had said or done for you and any other insight would be appreciated."

I’m sad, and the reason why is because I have no one, no friends, no family members to talk to, nothing. I have been alone for little over a year now, since may of 2020 I have had no one to talk or comfort me, every time I try to tell my parents how I feel they usually bitch and yell about something I didn’t do or shit that literally doesn’t have anything to do with the conversation, I have a therapist but he does Jack shit. I had a “friend” a couple months ago, I say that with quote on quote because he literally doesn’t care about me, even if I try to talk to him he usually walk away and do something else and I don’t have the energy to stop him. There are also people in my life that I generally hate so much that I have thoughts about strangling them to death, though I just try to avoid them. It’s 2022 and I still have no one, I’m not only starting to get depressed but I’m also going fucking insane and there’s nothing I can do about it."
depression,Is it bad The only thing g right now that os keeping alive is the fact that I have famliy and they would be absolutely devastated if I hurt my self o just have no desire right most days I'm completely fine them there's days like today where I'm lonely and I just want to die (i will never commet suicide Im To stubborn) I'm just so frustrated because if I talk to my famliy about how I feel or vent about the constant noise In my head I know it will make th feel horrible and I can't do that to them
depression,"I don’t think I can make it during the next five months It’s my senior year and I live in a small town. I have one friend but I don’t want to feel too dependent on them. I’ve tried to socialize and make friends with others but they’re too focused on social status and their cliques. I don’t really have a niche or a clique so I am casted out and left alone. It’s terrible and it’s been like this for the past 6 years. I cannot deal with the general lack of sincerity and it is so hard to find genuine people. So I often sit alone, unless my friend and I share lunches or classes. We share some but I feel as if I need to branch out more. But branching out is impossible in this bigoted and biased town. I have no one, I’m constantly exhausted and all I want to do is lie in bed and/or sleep. I don’t do things I enjoy and lately I haven’t been motivated to do school work which is very unlike myself. I just wish I could have the at home learning that occurred during quarantine. I just need to collect the assignments from my classes and I can just do it at home. To those I’ve spoken to, they mention that school is necessary for social interaction, but that is a ridiculous statement since those at my school isolate this who are different. I am too nervous of death so I will not kill myself, but I mentally and physically do not have any will left to get up in the morning especially when I have to go to school. I can’t do this anymore, everything just repeats like Groundhog Day and nothing changes and I lack the power to get up to make that change in my life. I try to seek friends online but it’s no t the same. This is literally a game of just waiting until I go to college or when I graduate high school. I just wish I could do the at home learning again for the next few months because sitting at the benches, skipping lunch, crying to myself, and receiving sympathy from teachers is too much. It’s just 6 hours of shame. Then I am so exhausted all the time which just makes me feel sick as if I had a cold. This isolation has gone on for so long I am often flustered when people go out of their way to talk to me which isn’t so frequent. This is just me venting for the most part, but I am seriously stuck with nowhere to go. I just can’t do this anymore and the exhaustion and anxiety is literally killing me. I’m sorry for this being so long winded but I hate everything right now. Thanks for those who’ve read this, I hope things are better for you all."

depression,I’m too behind In September I’m going to be going back to in person school after 2 years of being online. I haven’t even set foot in the university I will attend. I’m having. Major anxiety because I feel so different from others. I feel like an alien because I’m behind others my age. I’m 21 but I’ve never been on a date or in a relationship. Never had a hookup or sex. I don’t have social media because it makes me depressed seeing others living life while I wish I was dead. I don’t have a social life at all because I don’t have any friends. I don’t know how to make friends. I have social anxiety and at this point I’m just scared of getting close to people. I’m so nervous that I won’t be liked because people will sense that I have no friends or that I am immature. I am so not looking forward to it and I’m so stressed out. I might even lose my job since things are being closed down again and that’s my only source of getting out of the house 3 times a week. I’m honest contemplating suicide because I’m so sad and embarrassed about my life. I am a failure and a mess. I am so messed up that it’s probably a good thing I’m isolated from others.
depression,"Self hatred Every night I get to sleep by saying horrible things about myself and just mentally and emotionally beat the shit out of myself for like half an hour until I’m so emotionally exhausted that I fall asleep. And I feel like I deserve it. I’m certain I’m autistic but I’m so good at masking that no one can tell and no one takes me serious when I say it. Im at the deepest point I’ve ever been. Three high schools in three years, no friends, too scared to even look anyone in the eye. Im 16 years old almost 17 now, this is bullshit. I should’ve have to be getting my ass kicked like this.

I've got drunk on New Year's Eve, like most people do. Yesterday, on New Year's Day when I woke up I wasn't hungover just felt like the world is spinning a bit. 

However I've just woken up this morning and I feel grogy, unmotivated and depressed. Is this the hangover creepin' up on me, or is this guilt from essentially doing nothing yesterday and have no motivation do anything today? I suspect it's chemical imbalance, however I haven't got any medicine.

All my family says to me is that all I’ll be in life is a high school dropout, but no one knows the true reason I dropped out. No one truly knows how I feel because no one can stomach it. I joke around saying I want to die but is it really a joke at this point? I having nothing to live for if everyone hates me anyways."

depression,"sleep issues not sure if this is the right sub for this but... 

I have been struggling with \*wanting\* to go to bed every night. Every time I get ready to go to bed, I feel like I'm going to miss out on something, and then I succumb to the urge to pick up my phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel a sense of shame, for going to bed early so I don't oversleep the next day, as my parents want me up at 9 every morning. I see all my friends staying up late and chatting or gaming, and I know that staying up late is bad for my health, But i still want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

any tips? 

TLDR: i don't feel like sleeping. Makes me feel like a loser to go to bed early. 

It's probably not helping my mental health."
depression,"Could I possibly be depressed Hi everyone. I’m F 22. I’m a pretty emotionally stable person, I don’t get sad often. I work hard in school and get good grades.

However, sometimes I wonder if I show symptoms of depression. My room is so incredibly dirty and messy and I just don’t care. It’s been like that for a while. I don’t talk or open up much with my friends. Instead, I pursue a lot of online relationships or friendships with men, particularly those into BDSM. But it isn’t sexual, it’s just being able to talk to someone who is like a mentor figure.

Most of what I do is either masturbate, nap, waste time on my phone. I’m not interested in tv shows, movies or books, but I used to be. I don’t have motivation to exercise.

What I like to do is get dressed and go into the city. I like drinking and partying. That’s about all."
depression,"Gone dead Im so dead inside, i cant stop thinking about life when i was younger and how i actually felt happy and it makes me cry. I cant help but feel like the world i once lived in is gone forever. I just am so dead and empty and gone and also a addict. I cant believe how people (old friends) just forget about me, like i am always alone, anyways im withdrawing and im gonna start drinking vodka to deal with the depression."
depression,I feel like I faked my depression even though I know that’s not true In 2021 I spent most of my time fighting my intrusive thoughts and the thoughts about killing myself.I feel a lot better now but I feel like my mind is trying to drag me back into darkness through regret.It feels like I could’ve changed my destiny if I tried harder but I slacked off instead. Logically I know it isn’t too late but I catch myself believing that it’s too late which makes me really anxious
depression,"My one sincere hope. I am one incident away from having a relapse of my severe depressive episode. That is why I refuse to let myself fall in love, because I don't want to put myself in a vulnerable position. But I also know that when my parents pass, that will be the one thing that sets off everything in one swift motion. The only things that could hold me back then are my sister and friends. I hope everyone I know gets attached soon so there will be someone whom I can leave them to. 

I wish I could hope to be normal, but lets not dream big, shall we?"
depression,"The only thing keeping me alive... is the idea of us falling into a collapse that causes the whole entirety of the human race to go extinct. Literally, whenever the thought of me dealing with all my problems gives me anxiety, I just go on r/collapse, see how fucked up the world is and how my problems don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. My insignificance calms me."
depression,"Why can’t I just be… I feel like every day is a battle. I have to do so much mental work in order to just function, how do other people just live day to day without working on themselves? It’s like depression, addiction, disorders, etc. creates so much more daily work for people that are already more tired than those without these kinds of battles. It’s exhausting, I wish it wasn’t such a fight every day."
depression,"Feel like ending it I just feel like I’m so fucking worthless, like, seriously. I just looked at my liked videos on YouTube, and seeing some older ones reminds me of the past. I would give damn near anything just to go back in time, just to feel that sweet ignorant bliss I had back in the day. I used to have friends, I used to have good grades, I used to be so much better. Now I’m just a burden on everyone around me. I can feel it, when I talk to other people, they obviously don’t want anything to do with me. I remember in summer I had a really bad episode, like, I was absolutely ready to kill myself. I was a burden to literally everyone and everything around me. Things got better with time, but now I feel like I’m going back to that dark place. I feel like I’m a burden, and to be honest, the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my cat. As im writing this in my bed, my cat is sleeping at my feet. I love her. I wouldn’t want to disappoint her by disappearing. I don’t care about leaving my family though, like, don’t get me wrong, I love them, but they would be better off without me.  Thanks for reading."
depression,"Most days i hate myself so much that i don’t even want to die Ive always wondered if someone else feels this way. I just keep going through all the things i did in the past and people I’ve hurt and needless to say, I’m a real piece of shit. I have come to terms with that fact. I used to want to just die and rid the world of one more asshole but now i feel like i have to keep going because i deserve to suffer."
depression,"please dont hold a funeral i know its selfish. i know the funeral isnt for me, its for the living. but after i kill myself i desperately want to be forgotten. i dont want anyone to remember me, i want every trace of me to be erased from this earth. i feel so ashamed of my existence, i want to die alone and for no one to find me, to forget i even existed. i want to get what i deserve, i want to crawl into a corner of my room and get kicked in the stomach until i throw up, i want to throw myself against a wall until i cant walk, i want to get hurt i want to feel pain i want to get what i deserve i want to be forgotten i want to die"
depression,"My mental state is making me physically deteriorate i can’t take care of myself anymore. i haven’t showered in days and i feel disgusting but i just can’t get myself to do it. i stopped washing my face months ago and now my skin is covered in acne and it hurts to touch my face. i can only bring myself to brush my teeth once a day, and i haven’t properly cleaned my retainers in over a month. i bury my feelings with food, and i don’t have the willpower to exercise, so i just overall feel and look terrible. i barely change my fucking socks anymore. i don’t know how to pull myself out of this, and i don’t know how much longer i can go on like this."
depression,"Finally understand why people go off their meds I don’t want to be aware of everything that I am. I cannot handle the consequences of my actions. The fog has faded from the mirror, and I don’t like what I see. I can’t handle the selfish, hypocritical liar sitting in front of me, I don’t trust her to change. She’s hurt everyone she loves, why should I give her another chance? 
Maybe the depression was my brain’s way of protecting itself because if I’m too tired and crazy to deal with what’s in front of me, I won’t have time to realize that I am the problem. There’s a slightly increased risk of suicidal thoughts when you start antidepressants. If the fog lifts too quickly and you see the gross thing you are, perhaps you’ll realize you really are worth killing. Maybe the depression hides the truth from your brain. 
The truth is I’m not moving forward, I’m not changing for the better. You can’t transform shit into gold. I keep removing harmful coping mechanisms and bad habits, but the person left underneath is garbage.
I can’t fix me, I never worked."

depression,"Struggling. hi, I have no clue how to start this but I've been struggling with depression for a while and I have no one to really talk to and I tend to get really bad episodes, I've been getting them a lot more frequently and they are a lot harder to deal with recently. I'm not sure if I need a trigger warning here but I have attempted and I've been struggling with those thoughts all over again and it's been really hard. I have had trouble with feeling like I'm fucking up a lot of my friendships and relationships. I just haven't had anyone to talk to because sometimes I can't turn to the two people I normally do because they both are going through a lot themselves. I have also struggled with a lack of concentration. I do also have problems at home that worsen my depression and stop me from getting diagnosed with anything other than depression. Im not sure what else to say so yeah thats it :)"
depression,"Life wants me dead. People won't miss me. I read a lot of comments where people say they don't end it because of loved ones, their mom and dad, etc. ""I just don't want to upset my mom."" and all that.

When I read that, I think: I don't even have that.

~~People want me dead.~~ Alright that might be a bit too much, but they can certainly miss me. They certainly seem to want me out of their life.

I've tried and tried over and over again to make something of my life. The result is always the same: 1 step forward, 3 steps back, 1 step forward, 3 steps back. Life seems to want me dead. And the people around me don't like me that much either. They very well can miss me.

At this point I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm basically just waiting for this world to collapse. If that doesn't happen soon, I'm running out of money and then I assume it's just over for me."
depression,"I just want to kill myself Everyone has rejected me for being myself as an immigrant growing up in israel as an American the Arabs were friendly but the other jews I was around were just straight up racist towards me because I'm white because of my culture of being American and not accepting me for who I am I was always nice to people even when I had it all ,but when I fell they kicked me when I was down and nobody helped"
depression,"Porn and masturbation are the only things that bring me any pleasure now. I used to be bright. I used to be optimistic. I used to have a future. That's all gone now.

All I fucking do now is work the night shift at a bullshit job that I'm too afraid to quit. I'm an addict who wastes his hard earned money on phone sex every night because I'm too much of a pussy to date. I'm fucking disgusting. I can't do anything else now but beat my dick to feel anything. I can't contribute anything to this world. I can't invent anything. I can't create anything. I'm too weak to offer even the smallest of good deeds to a homeless man. I'm too much of a fucking fraud to even show up to my parents' house for Christmas. I'm too much of a little bitch to be there for my little sister and autistic brother. I can't do anything.

depression,"Wake up, enjoy a cup of tea and enjoy yourself in this first day of 2022 You are older, perhaps wiser, but you are stronger. That's for sure. You continue to resist against your problems, your thoughts, your world, with or without friends or parents. Maybe this is the year of change or it'll always be the same year but you are still here.
Take a cup of tea (or whatever you want), watch your world from the window of your house, your office, your hospital and take a moment of rest and relax.
For all those who are not here... enjoy the peace you deserve.
I'm not here to be a fake guru or psychologist. I cannot bring words of joy like your favourite Pope, leader or waifu/husbando.

depression,"I hate my country Ok, I shouldn't probably complain since I live in a 1st world country, but people here have an intrusive mentality and I feel like venting a bit. Everyone is keen on hearing and spreading new rumors. Mental issues have always been some sort of taboo. You have to pretend that everything is alright if you don't want to be labelled as ""the weird one"".

I live in a small town where almost everyone knows everything about other people. Gossip is really popular and rumors spread easily.

People living in my country are, generally speaking, loud, talkative, extroverse, fashionable (unlike me). I feel like many of them pretend to be ""warm"" and ""welcoming"" (that's how my country is often described). But that's not true, most people are actually cold, egoistic, vulgar and are willing to find someone to criticize and exclude. And I've always been excluded. 

I was not made for this country and society. I'm not saying I'm better than them. I'm simply the wrong person born in the wrong country, probably.

Yes, I know I'm complaining too much since I've been lucky enough to be born in a 1st world country. Yet I feel like my country's society can be harmful for certain people."

I don't know what's gonna make me step up and start a new better life, it's unknown for now and I really hope I'll figure it out in the next 2 years or else I don't think I can live like that anymore."
depression,"How to help a depressed friend who doesn't read or reply to me anymore? Hello

Some background: We live in a country where mental health is not taken seriously and living outside your parent's house is VERY frowned upon unless you're married, so my friend can't just live alone or go to a therapist with their parents.

The issue started a year ago when my friend's brother and favorite son died a rather horrible death. Their parents took this HARD and started getting depressed. The father started smoking more heavily and even got a stroke from the stress/smoking, and the mother took it the hardest.

My friend's mom used to be sweet and understanding, but right now she just screams at her children and takes anything they say out of context to fight with them. My friend at first was affected by their brother's death but got over it soon after. Then, they started ""supporting"" their parents by allowing themselves to be their parent's ""punchbag"". My friend and siblings at first tried to be kind to their parents because they're old and this is obviously hard on them, but right now, all of them are depressed as well. My friend opened up to me about how all of this is too stressful, and how all they do now is sleep, go to work, deal with parents. Rinse and repeat

6 months ago, my contact with my best friend started getting irregular. We've known each other since high school  (but we live in different cities since 3 years ago) and from that time, we chat daily multiple times a day. The first time I noticed how they started replying once a day instead of multiple times a day, all their messages are short or things like ""haha"", ""lol"", ""ikr"". Then, they suddenly stopped replying or reading my messages for 3 weeks. After this, I was worried that my friend was suicidal (they were prone to depression/suicide since we were in high school). That's when they finally opened up to me about what was happening and how stressed/depressed they are. They even became workaholics to run away from their life at home. I offered my friend my support and told them I will be available always.

From that day, I kept checking on my friend regularly to make sure they're okay. 3 months ago, they told me their mom's getting better and their aunts and uncles are helping her with depression by taking her shopping and on vacations, and so on. I asked my friend what about them? and they answered, ""tbh I'm about to break down haha"". I replied with so many messages about my loving them, how everything will get better, how I'm always here for them ..etc. They said they're really happy and glad I'm there for them. Then, they stopped replying to me. On their birthday, I sent a happy birthday message to them, they replied to me. Then stopped reading our chats again.

My friend used to be active on Facebook as well. They stopped posting there 6 months ago. I have their Twitter account as well. I don't want to come as stalkerish so I didn't send them anything on there because they told me about the handle in the past, but I don't have an account so I never followed them there. They last liked a post a week ago. So at least I know my friend is alive. Note: all their liked posts are about depression, helping parents, finding one's self, loneliness, and so on.   
I just don't know how to get them out of this when they're not even reading my messages. I honestly am worried about them and wondering if their mother is really getting better? or was that a lie to make me feel better? what if they're getting better but just don't want to be my friend anymore because I am too clingy? I just don't know anymore"
depression,I’m exhausted I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore.
depression,"Introvert boyfriend with depression Hello. Happy new year to all. Although i've spent the first two days of the year crying alone in my room.

Here's why.

We just got back together. We are LDR so I was excited to video call him on new year's eve. I rang him twice and left messages about how I was going to wait for him to call me back. I said it was an important day and I wanted to greet him happy new year. We had agreed earlier that he would call me.

He replied after 1.5 hrs and said he just woke up (around 9:30pm) and sounded angry that I was so insistent about a call. He said he hadn't even called his family or anyone.

My heart was crushed. How could a boyfriend be that harsh with his girlfriend who was just excited to talk to him on a special night?

I think I've developed anxiety because of how unreliable he is about being there for me. He's never there when I need him but I've always tried to understand. He also says he doesn't like his birthday, Christmas, etc. The important days. Because of this I've started to suspect that maybe he's with someone else and spends these important days with her.

He's also deleted my recent comments on social media because he said they made him uncomfortable. His profile is public but he only posts about his pet. I commented on several old photos.

Could it really be because of his personality and depression or he's cheating?

I'm second guessing myself because I'm aware I have trust issues and it's easy for me to think of the worst scenarios.

TL;DR LDR bf got angry about me being so ""insistent"" about an NYE's call. And he recently also deleted my comments on his social media because they ""made him uncomfortable."" We just got back in together. Simply an introvert with depression or cheating on me?"
depression,"I’m jealous of my older sister’s connection with my family. She has everything: friends, looks, and she’s smart too.

I really love her and we actually have a good relationship but there are times when I get so frustrated that I start to resent her. It not her fault and I know that it’s entirely myself but my brain unconsciously does it. I’m just gonna type everything that’s been happening Bc I have no one to talk to. 

My moms (mom’s sisters and my grandma) side really adores my sister. They have a connection that I can never seem to be included in.

I’m Filipino and I only understand Tagalog but my moms side speaks a different Filipino dialect and only my sister can understand since she lived with them for a while when she was younger. I can make out simple words but most of the time everything gets drowned out and I just watch them talk. I’ve asked my sister to translate so I could be included but she ends up getting annoyed and stops. I cry a lot in the bathroom when I’m over at their house but I still enjoy going there because they’re my family. 

Yesterday my mom said that my sister was going to sleepover at their house Bc my grandma invited her. I instantly thought I was going too Bc that’s usually how it was and we haven’t slept over in years. My mom replied that only my sister was invited. I brushed it off like it was nothing but I was hurt and I know my mom is aware bc I’ve expressed that I was jealous that they only came to my sister’s bdays/graduations in the past. Today she told me that I could go and I don’t know why that made me so sad. I refused bc I know they only invited me bc of something my mom said."

I am 19 and am going through an episode of nearly debilitating anxiety. My doctor prescribed prozac.


It’s been day 4 of taking the medication? everything feels very stimulating, which is the opposite of citalopram. I think it’s making my anxiety worse. a couple hours ago, looking at my phone, I started getting these really loud thoughts, which were more like banshees, yelling at me that I’m useless and that I stress people out and that I’m a burden to my family and to the world. Eventually those thoughts cycled to that I shouldn’t be here anymore. 

I am scared. I have never experienced this before and am really terrified. 

I was also prescribed a few .5mg of alprazalam tablets which I am also scared to try. 

Is this just me or should I stop the medication? I am going to try to see my doctor. I am using this to distract me. What should I do right now? should I take alprazalam or might that make it worse? 

Those thoughts went away and came back a few times. I am not feeling them now.

My relationship with my mother is terrible, my relationship with my dad is almost nonexistent, and my brother went over six weeks without speaking to me and now is not speaking to me again. I’ve had two people anonymously harass me. I’ve had many other people who I wanted to build relationships with slowly just stop responding or going places with me eventually forget me. The friends I do seem to keep always end up hurting me badly in some way. 

I’m far from perfect and I’ll be the first to admit that, but I don’t know how I could’ve possibly been awful enough to deserve what I’ve been through. I’ve been pushed around, walked all over, shoved aside, and forgotten. People seem to think I’m a piece of shit. Maybe I am, I don’t know. My own mind is hard enough to handle, but compounded with knowing I seem like the least lovable person in the world is really difficult. When I was at my relationship peak I struggled immensely, now that I’m at a relationship low I feel like I’m so deep in a hole that I can never escape. I just feel so tired and alone.

I cried in the small hours of this morning in bed for the first time in a long time. I feel alone. I have a friend but thats it. Progress on last year. The other day some people I thought were friendly-ish, well one of them was disgusting to me after I made an innocent enough joke like he'd make at me, but he didn't like it. No loss ther I didn't like him anyway but the stuff he said...the way i look, dress, even the fact im in a crappy job rn. 

I've tried hard to get a relationship, but as usual, it's proving hard. Dating apps are my only way really right now as i dont really have a proper job. Some girls literally unadd me after they see a picture of me. Not that I'm even ""ugly"". I had to drop out of university at the start of the year (where i actually lost my virginity on my first night) because I got pneumonia. I found out the other day that there are false rumours going around which are very vindictive and damaging. Meaning I probably can't go back there. 

I don't think a partner should ever be your source of happiness, but I can't help but feel it is a big thing when I'm seeing everyone else with theirs. I'm autistic and sometimes think maybe thats why but most people wouldn't know. I will find out relatively soon if I'm successful in the job I'm applying for, a job that will basically set me up for life and be a lifetime career but it could go either way. Ironically enough the biggest hurdle will probably be the fact I'm on meds. If I fail, I don't know what I will do. Six month wait to reapply. I worked in retail earlier this year. For a week. I hated it, i was treated like shit and I'm not working somewhere like there again. I'm going to reapply for different universities but I'm not sure if its for me. But then other than the job I am applying for I have no idea what to do. 

I'm fed up of being alone. I'm a hard man. I don't take shit from anyone anymore. I've had the shit bullied out of me year after year, I've stood on a bridge with my life on one side and death on the otehr, I got back up every single fucking time, no one will land a punch on me that I can't get back up from. I'm a fucking warrior, a survivor, so I get upset when I cry. I feel even though I've changed myself, the world around me, my life, hasn't really changed.

And that really bothers me. Because I was expecting some things around me to change in response to me, and whilst I have been more successful with women than the yhear before, I'm still very much single and have been for well over a year and a half, and its so demoralising. The fact I'm also don't even know what job I want. 

If someone can please offer advice. I don't want a counsellor. I've seen so many - counsellors, physchiatrists, psychologists, hypnotherapists - all as useless as each other, to me anyway. I've always relied on myself and will continue to do so. I'm not afraid to admit I might need help on the way, but ultimately I think I've got to do this by mself. This is my life, even though plenty of people have been resonsible for fucking it up."
depression,"Im so depressed I can’t function anymore. Life is pointless. We go to school, get jobs to buy things we can’t take with us when we die.
Every day is a struggle. Life just seems like a waste of time. Nothing gives me happiness anymore. I feel like every day is Groundhog Day….
Wake up…go to work…wait to get old and die.
I should be happy, I have a good life. I’m just so depressed and it’s taking over my life."
depression,"How to go about dealing with severe depression and low self-esteem after rough breakup? Almost 3 months post breakup. Found myself deeply depressed. Can't find enjoyment in just about anything no more. Have to force myself not to hide away in food alchohol or drugs to numb the loss. 

Starting therapy next week, but wondering how exactly to go on living when nothing in life does it for me no more. Can't find ways to distract myself, lost all motivation and passion for past hobbies. Even more mindless activities like watching television. Listening to music or playing videos game do nothing for me.

All I am still managing is a shower a day, waking up on time for work (then pretending to work) I work remotely from home so it is a bit easier.

I feel life now is just this continuous presentation of all things beautiful I used to enjoy but can no longer."
depression,"I am a truly worthless person, incapable of relating to anyone, and I can't cope with being alone anymore I have been alone for years, but I feel like I can't take being alone for another week. I feel like I'm going insane. It doesn't stop hurting and crowding out every other thought.

I can't cope with being alone anymore. I have felt very strange and different from others as far back as I can remember, I have always found it impossible to relate to other people. I can remember feeling horribly lonely and miserable and desperately seeking companionship and wanting a girlfriend as far back as elementary school, and the thoughts would creep in all day long, but I always had just barely enough distractions to keep myself going. Nothing works anymore, I can't hide from it anymore. I have given up on everything else that I care about and which had given my life meaning.

It sounds laughable, but I am incapable of doing literally anything but thinking about girls and love now. I am in my mid-twenties and I have never had a girlfriend, I have no idea what it is like to be wanted or to experience any form of physical intimacy. Thinking about how desperately I want to be hugged by a girl who loves me right now, and simultaneously how unlikely the odds are of ever having that happen, makes my body ache and makes me feel like I'm going to break down in a panic. After so many years of isolation and inability to connect to other people my self-esteem and self-confidence is deep in the negatives, I have for so many years felt utterly worthless and unwanted, and I spend all day thinking about how much I hate myself and despairing over all the things that are wrong with me.

NOTHING is enjoyable to me anymore. Nothing can distract me anymore. My mind is so constantly focused on my loneliness now every minute of the day that I feel sick and my body physically hurts all day long every day. I've always had trouble eating but now it's even harder to force myself to eat anything. I can hardly sleep because these thoughts are always occupying me and keeping me up. I have lost interest in all of my hobbies. Life is funny/vicious in that all of this only makes me a more repulsive person--as I become a more and more hollow person and lose interest in everything, it's as if I have nothing to talk about but wanting to be loved. Life is such that it is so easy for the weak to only get weaker. It frustrates me endlessly that I continue to hold out with this impossible-to-dislodge last remaining shred of hope, as if I think someone is coming to save me, as if someone will come and magically heal me and everything will be all better. No one is coming to save me. I have stayed passive and unchanging for years, only letting things worsen around me. I am weak, I am incompetent, I am a coward, and I am utterly paralyzed with indecision. I have demonstrated for my entire life that I am incapable of changing anything myself.

There are so many complications and problems with me that I can't suspend disbelief enough to imagine why anyone would ever want to bother with me in the first place, and as if that wasn't enough, I have always felt somehow irreconcilably distant from and incapable of properly relating to anyone I've ever encountered. Even if, against all odds and against all of what my prior life experience taught me, a girl managed to genuinely want me and love me for who I am, would I even be able to love her? What are the odds of her meeting enough of my unreasonably specific criteria for it to feel right, for me to feel like I could relate to her? Despite having looked for years, I am too quickly disinterested in any girls I encounter to bother pursuing anyone. I wish that anyone would do, but my idea of compatibility matters so deeply to me and it makes me feel like a choosing beggar, and this is a substantial source of my self-hatred. The result is that no one wants me, and in spite of my desperate yearning, I seem to want no one. My romantic idealism torments me. I'll always feel empty, hopelessly lost in thought daydreaming throughout each day of the kind of meaningful experience with love that I wish I had, but instead I will have nothing at all. Escapism is all I have, daydreaming is all I have, imagining being someone else that isn't this repulsive and unwanted husk that I am.

And then there is the yearning for sexual intimacy and the intense sexual frustration that leads to constant masturbation and self-hatred, feeling sick with myself for letting thoughts of sexual compatibility get in the way of my searching for love, despairing over the sheer incalcuable unlikelihood that a girl could ever meet the aforementioned criteria of somehow loving me in spite of my flaws and being compatible with me such that I am able to love her, WHILE ALSO having the kind of extremely statistically improbable body that I would find pleasing, and aligned sexual interests and fetishisms across the board that have somehow managed to develop similarly to mine, and being able to satisfy my sexual desires warped by pornography and my years of obsessive fantasizing, to keep me from otherwise feeling a sense of lacking and aching for that kind of release, which just causes me to despair further and hating myself for having any sexuality at all and for having such warped preferences to begin with such that it is yet another major point of incompatibility. I don't want a girl's appearance to matter to me at all, and I certainly don't want to expect her to have the kind of extremely statistically improbable body that I would find pleasing. I know that I would never disregard a girl as a romantic candidate for such an idiotic reason, that has never crossed my mind in any of my limited interactions with a girl before, but at the same time I know it would eat me up inside fixating on the idea of never being sexually satisfied in the way I've dreamed of so many thousands of times, and this makes me feel like a stupid animal, it makes me curse the deeply unhealthy way my brain has shaped and feel greater revulsion and hatred for myself.

I so desperately want to be wanted and not so easily discarded. I wish I was worth SOMETHING. A girl has on very rare occasion read something I've written online and come to me before every couple of years, which in spite of my aforementioned choosiness is always an opportunity I have desperately seized and tried to make work as every time it feels like it could be my last, but it seems to me that they became disillusioned very quickly and did not have romantic interest in me or value me as highly as I did them, and things just disintegrate, we drift apart, and I'm back to no longer holding onto any kind of opportunity (all this without them ever even seeing how ugly I am). As I get older and older, I can only imagine even this pathetic 0% success rate strategy being less and less viable, making it so I can't even have the luxury of fooling myself with a brief glimpse of hope every couple years. I want a girl to want me as much as I want her and to want me in the same way that I want her, but I know this dynamic is impossible. So many other options are out there--why would anyone ever want me? And how does anyone ever decide on who they want to be with?

I feel like I never got a chance to be young and live my youth. It is clear to me that I have wasted my youth and things only seem to point towards getting worse and worse. The development of my mind is stunted. I am unemployed and have repeatedly demonstrated being incapable of dealing with any adult responsibilities (despite this I am left to struggle with them on my own, of course). By age I am in my mid-twenties, I have the mind of an utterly helpless and needy child, and I have the body of a decrepit haggard old man--already nearly bald, short, bony and gaunt, with a sickly complexion and various other chronic health problems to go with it that I really should not have in my youth. All I want is a girl to think I'm cute and love me and hold me and run her hand through my hair (of which I physically can't grow out of much of my scalp anymore), I think that nothing in the world could possibly be more comforting. I will never know what it is like. Even if a girl did touch me or call me cute, it would feel starkly and unshakably wrong, knowing what I look like, what I feel like.

Being trapped in this body and mind feels like a nightmare that I can't wake up from. Funny enough, at the back of my mind I keep feeling like I'm waiting for this to all be over, like me real life will begin soon and things will be okay, as if I'll just wake up as a kid again and my brain will be correct and my body will be correct and things will go right and I'll live the life I had always daydreamed about countless times. That's impossible, of course. This is my only chance at existence, my only experience of being alive, and I am spending it like this. Every single last bit of hope and potential I have ever had is rapidly slipping away from me, and then soon I will be gone, but soon could never be soon enough when I have for years continued to suffer for no reason like this. How many more years will I rot for? The most common platitude is something to the effect of ""Things get better."" My life has taught me that things only ever get worse, things only hurt more and more every year. I've thought to myself I was at my limit many times before, I'm sure. There is no limit to how much you can suffer if you are too ineffectual to change anything in your life for the better. For years I have at intervals been compelled to shout into the void. I still don't entirely understand why. It does not help, the problems still remain of course.

I am a disgusting and worthless human being. My misery does not matter, my entire life of endless disappointment and loneliness and self-hatred can be reduced down to a joke. My problems do not matter. No one cares. How could they possibly care? Everyone has their own problems to deal with, and I am a deeply broken person that is not worth fixing. If there was someone with good and potential in me once, there is not enough of me left to be worth fixing. My mind does not stop tormenting me throughout the day, and even in each one of my dreams. I just want everything to stop hurting."
depression,None of this means anything I seriously can't wait to die someday I'm so exhausted of all this pointless day to day rinse and repeat routine I didn't ask for. The new year means nothing to me it's not happy at all. Logging off now
depression,"I'm trying to stay afloat but people around me are just draining me So I'm struggling with depressive episodes. Exactly a year ago I was sobbing, in bed, with no job, no money, no friends, nothing! And I wasn't enjoying anything, I forgot how to have fun and do the things that I loved.

Now a year later, Im much calmer, I got a job in the middle of last year and it's all going fine for me. But the people, the people around me are so depressing, and so draining.

I can't take it anymore around my bf nor my parents, who are the most important people in my life. I'm trying so hard to stay positive, energetic and I was finally able to enjoy things again.

But they all have troubles of their own, which I lend an ear to, but they're all constantly complaining. All the damn time. It's draining me out, and making me fall back into being anxious and to being depressed again.

It's sad."
depression,"I just want to drift out of consciousness and never come back. (Things i havent told anyone) First of i dont know if i am depressed or not, i just have a need to cry on someones sholders right now but i am not close to anyone like that. I dont want to be seen shedding a single tear by anyone. 

It's been almost two years since i finished highschool. Back then i knew i was a bit sad and would often think of my own death. I never harmed myself physicaly, only i fantasized about the ways i could die almost everyday. I used to be a very ambitious student before that. Everyone, including me had high hopes about my future. But then high school came and i just sort off lost interest in everything. At first it was noticable (to my parents) that i wasnt studying that much. My grades were all over the place, sometimes i got easy As sometimes i bearly got a passing grade. I couldnt sit and study like i used to before. I just didnt have a spark of willingness. Anyway as time passed i became a somewhat better student( in a room/class of 28 students i was on the top 4, granted mine is not a very competetive country).

I graduated(2020), i still wasnt excited about anything. I  didnt know if i still like math like i used to, i hadnt properly studied if for years. I decided to study compuer science(good job prospects and all that). I thought if i dont feel passionate about anything i might as well choose this. I finished first year. I got some good grades in half the classes, failed the other half.(In my country at least this Uni, its very difficult to fail a whole year,since you can sit on an exam quite a few times). I told my mom that i want to drop out and that i will find something else to study. This conversation was very difficult for me, i made it as short as possible, tried to look normal and casual even though i felt like a failure. We never spoke of this again. When the email to comfirm that we are attending second year came, i waited till the last day but i confirmed anyway. I didnt quit. But i know that i HAVE to drop out, im just not gonna pass. I still have half the classes of my first year  plus the second year. I didnt attend most of my classes this year. When i am asked how i am doing/feeling ...
i just try to give a convincing positive answer and change the topic.

Everyone thinks that i am doing okay(not flourishing, but okay). I am not. I constatly feel like a failure, and what used to be passive thoughts about death have now consumed me completely. I just dont want to feel anything anymore. 
I dont have friends anymore. I never had one close friend, i was always part of a group and rarely hanged out with just one of them. They are all nice people, and its only my fault we dont talk anymore. I always felt like i was putting up a front, i was never 100%  comfortable with anyone, going out felt more like a duty or chore than fun.It was tiring, I always regreted going out. A few month ago i decided to cut ties, and i did. I know i am the bad guy in their story, since it happened unexpectedly and i didnt give an explenation. I feel sorry for that but i just couldnt try anymore.

I am not super close to my family, and thats on me too. I can never talk to my dad about anything serious, same goes for my siblings who are both younger than me. Mom tries to talk to me the most, but i still cant tell her any of this. I try to make the conversations brief and not deep. The last time i remember nearly crying in front of her is in 12th grade, when i didnt want to go an a school trip. We had gone shopping and  done some preperation, but later I told her that i am not going. She of couse asked me why. I said that i didnt feel like it. The truth is that i knew it was going to be overwhelming for me to go to all those parties, historical sites and so on, for a week straight, while i had never felt uglier and worse before.

This turned out to be quite long, i just needed to get some things out of me. Thanks to anyone who takes their time to read this. Going out now."

depression,"Loneliness is the worst demon I've ever met I just want a hug and to put my head on someone's shoulder but I won't have the chance for a while. There's nobody I just wanted a hug and to feel safe again. If I never started a relationship I wouldn't know what it's like to held just for it to be gone again. I miss it all. I just wanna cry in someone's lap but I'm a guy I can't ask for that. I just choke alot because it's even worth crying over anymore. Absolutely nobody I miss being happy now I'm back in my abusive house because of financial reasons. I just wanna go to sleep but I can't because arguing woke me up now sun's up. I don't even want to wake but I will to pretend I'm happy like normal so I don't worry anyone again. I don't even get hugs from my mom anymore I'm too old I guess. I know though that there's no point in hoping because you then you get your hopes up for nothing. I was literally a mistake that burdened my mom's life and now I'm just lonely. Nobody's gonna see this like usual and I feel like I'm dying inside daily. No matter what I do to make me happy this cloud returns. I just want it all to stop. I miss school and my friends graduation everything got worse than I got sick. I don't even know the point of this it's not like someone can help me but maybe I'll show a therapist if I even get the courage to go back because I ghosted them when they wanted to meet in person. I'm ready for the afterlife and this life is just horrid. Everyone's busy while I'm stuck trying to get happy so I can start my life. Meditation helps but it hurts too reflecting on all my mistakes by myself because theirs nobody. I because my own therapist and even I can see this patient ain't doing too hot. I'm tired,hungry, depressed sad, lonely,broke and mental illness is wrescking me. A wrestling icon of mine said something that just loops in my mind.

On the 8th day
God created Mankind
Why was He having such a bad day?!
Why did He created all of you normal
And forget some of the important parts of me?!
He made the teeth that I swallowed
The ear that was ripped from my skull
A face that no longer exists!!
Deep inside you are merely a mirror image
Of all my atrocities!!
The ugliness that exists outside
Lives inside every one of you!
(sobbing)
Destruction
CAN BE BEAUTIFUL!!!!
Leave the light on
I'M COMING HOME!!!"
depression,"Psychically sick My mind has been so overwhelmed recently and my depressive thoughts are getting so bad that I'm starting to get sick from it. I've also been having headaches almost daily and just feel weak most of the time. I hate this, I don't want to be here anymore. I just want everything to end."
depression,"I'm genuinely wondering what is just so wrong with me. I don't even know how to properly start off. Lately, I've found myself plenty of times in deep thoughts about my friends and the people around me; and I just came to the conclusion of how terrible my life genuinely is. I just realized how many times I've been hurt throughout my entire high school life and how this tormented my mental state.

I recall all those moments from my freshman and sophomore year when I'd simply get bullied, harassed, and made fun of. It still is so even after the pandemic, people talk shit behind me and at this point, I've become this meme around my school that everyone seems to laugh at.

It's not that I'm all by myself at school. I do have a few friends that I hang out with, though with them unironically enough it's still the same case. They are so keen on mocking me the whole time to the point where I've sort of become desensitized to their teasing remarks. I try to be caring and the person that they can enjoy their company with. I try to be the best for them. I'm always the one who helps them out in every case, and in return, they simply treat me like garbage. 

I'm very well aware that this is a toxic relationship, I tried to get out of it. But, I'm just so afraid of the consequences, particularly of the things they could do.

Trust me, I tried every fucking thing to get better in terms of social skills. I attempted to get out of my comfort zone and go out making some friends and more than that I tried to focus on myself, love myself, take care of myself and simply lay off giving fucks about all the things people would do to me. I picked up some hobbies that I'd genuinely embrace. Nonetheless, it resulted negatively every time. I reached out to my teachers and my own family about all this, they did nothing. Apparently, I don't even have one fucking normal friend.

I don't know why I'm just so unlikable. There's no single person that likes me as a true friend. I feel so suffocated by everything and everyone around me. Every single day is just like another challenge. I can't even remember the last time I was truly happy. On top of all this, there's also this loneliness.

I don't know what I should do just to have a fucking regular life.

(Sorry for my bad choice of words, not my native language.)"
depression,"Nightmares My nightmares began to get alot worse lately and it is effecting my daily life because I'm just so tired and can't focus.
Does anyone know what could help which does not include therapy or something where I have to go to see a doctor?

Changing sleep position maybe?"
depression,"do I have depression? /srs TW: suicidal thoughts 

Hi :D im 15F undiagnosed and I can't go to a doctor (I'm from SG) because of mental health stigma from peers/family and such over here. This is my first time on this sub as I don't know who to go to, but I want to vent and ask for help as I've been bottling it up for a while. sorry if this is long n poorly-written in adv &lt;3

As long as I can remember I can't stop fidgeting at quiet times especially (family meals, in class) and focusing (I always got reprimanded for careless mistakes). I'm also known to lose things (wallet, phone) easily. I didn't really attribute it to anything though, until this year when a teacher mentioned it. It's a long story so I'll break it into parts.

~socially and academically 😬🖐️~

Since this year I've started to feel socially withdrawn from my friends and have lost interest in social activities that I used to be enthusiastic to and I feel drained at the idea of talking to new people/ doing class activities. When I'm talking to them, it feels like there's a impenetrable invisible wall between me and my friends. And if there's more than 2 people, I feel apart from the crowd. I also can't start any convos no matter how hard I try to motivate myself to.

I also can't focus on school assignments/papers and don't have the motivation to do so, so my grades are slipping.i have a major exam this year, so I am scared. 

~suicidal thoughts and maladaptive daydreaming~ 
I have started to read online fanfiction sites (wattpad/ao3/webtoon) and I feel like it's brought up thoughts of suicide. NOT OF DOING IT, but about the concept of suicide, and daydreaming about stories where the oc dies (and how they die) too much. I shudder at the thought of cutting myself though. I've used stories as an escape from my real life, so much so I have multiple elaborate AUs in my head and I daydream for hours on end. When I am happy, I daydream about happy scenarios in my stories. I know that ADHD/Depression/Maladaptive Daydreaming go hand in hand. 



I just want to hear from people suffering from depression if they think I should really go and see a doctor (I've only researched on this online but I know online sources are not to be totally trusted), and to get some weight off my shoulders lmao.

TL;DR- possible depression/ADHD/maladaptive daydreaming symptoms, thoughts of the idea of suicide, need advice &lt;3"
depression,"All is not well I don't if it's me but I am overwhelmed w/ pretending that I am okay and I am happy during the recent holidays and this overwhelming emotions made ma realize that I am awfully tired w/ dealing w/ my family's unhealed traumas and shouldering every responsibilities that parents supposed to deal w/ from keeping the family together to paying our bills and keeping them alive. I am at the edge of commiting suicide but I still try to make it until the end of the day and just in case I did, I started making letters to people I meet and made an impact on my life. I am lost rn."
depression,"My sadness is getting physical It feels like someone literally has a dagger stuck in my chest. Recently it's been all I can think about and just want it to go away. I know that it's here because I feel extremely alone, but I don't even have a chance to change that for a long time (covid) and I just don't know what to do. I'm sinking into addiction quickly but now even when I'm high the feeling stays. The last few nights I had to smoke until I mentally couldn't focus on the pain anymore. Does anyone have any advice?"

I've already discussed my will but bring it up in nonchalant ways. I've went from 220 to 160 and literally pulling hair out like alot more than I'd like to admit. I'm actually scared to get a haircut because I'm worried their will be bald spots. Its like I'm just a game piece to be thrown to the side. I'm eating once a day if I'm lucky or snacking throughout. It's almost funny to watch myself die and nobody else seems to care so why should I is how I feel right now. My stomach is cramping my eyes hurt but light out now. Hope is dwindling to me. I miss the better days. Before the fights, my dad and Nana passing. My friends moving away or growing distance. I wanna see him again just to remember more what he was like. There's so much he never got to tell me next year will be my 21st and he can't even drink with me. I hope he's doing OK. Look at me pretending he's still here to feel better. He's gone and it won't ever change"
depression,Chronic illness I’m at 20 year old male and I have been chronically ill for 15 years now. I don’t remember what it is like to not be in pain. There have been suicidal thoughts in my head since I was 12 and I keep getting closer to just giving in. I just want the pain to stop.

I used to have some days that I would be down but recently it seems that I just idk how to put it bored, exhausted, and just idk everything is just something I guess"
depression,"Depression, or laziness? Hello everyone, I come to this thread with a question. How can you best discern whether the reason for struggling through life is depression, or just a product of bad habits of laziness? This is something I’ve been dealing with lately. I’ve always been really tough on myself, as I’m pretty naturally competitive, type A, conscientious,  however you want to describe it, so that may be why I’m struggling so much with this question, but ever since I’ve come up to college I’ve had a hard time doing anything pretty much. I miss about half of my 9am morning classes (which ironically are the only classes I have A’s in) because I just can’t muster up the energy to get out of bed. After classes I just feel mentally exausted, and I usually go right to my room and usually nap for 2-3 hours. Mustering the energy to do HW is also really hard, as well as basically anything else, laundry, doing errands, etc. Basically, my ideal day would be laying in bed from morning to night watching YouTube videos. Can anyone help? Thanks."
depression,"Sudden mood shift (Any ideas what it could be) So a for the past 3-4 years I have had clinical depression, during most of those few years I constantly wanted to kill myself and really hated my life. Most of this year I had that numbing feeling of neither being happy or sad but something weird happened a few weeks ago. One day I woke up and felt strangely good, like actually normal. Nothing in my life changed to were it would affect my mood drastically. I am scares that is just a pyschcolgical defense mechanism and this is just a temporary thing. Because while I feel normal to an extent something just feels off, sorta like when I had that numbing feeling. Any ideas as to what it could be?"
depression,Can i just ask my local med shop for anti d pills/tablets? do i need any kind of special prescription? or can i just ask the Pharmacy guy? I'm under 18 (17) answers appreciated. thanks.
depression,I feel so alone I don’t know how to cope anymore. I lost the girl I love and care about because I didn’t give her space and I’m not sure if she will ever return or reach out. I have nothing going good in my life at the moment I’m just really alone I can’t enjoy my video games or anything anymore.
depression,"I’m not gonna fight my depression tonight (not a suicide post)

It’s so exhausting to feel this way. I feel so disconnected, anxious, and lost. Every night I console myself, try to distract myself, but I can’t be bothered anymore. Nothing helps. 

I feel so disconnected from this plane, but I can’t describe the feeling to my parents. 

Medically, I am not doing great. Thing is, I’d rather control my death then have it be inevitable. 

I have chickened out of therapy offices so many times. I ditched so many sessions due to anxiety I got booted lol. I just want help

I always feel this way in this exact time of year. For 5 years straight.

I am just going to lie down, feel like shit and not bother tonight."
depression,"I feel way worse after talking about it I feel way worse after talking about my depression &amp; suicidal thoughts. Like talking about it makes it more real in my mind because before, the thoughts were merely dormant, but now they’re attached to a memory or experience that I physically sat through and lived. It makes me feel those feelings more too, which of course is really great when those feelings are the worst feelings in the world. It feels exactly like I’m  retraumatizing myself by speaking about this shit in person."
depression,"i need someone to talk to please i’m in 10th grade and i’ve been struggling with pretty severe depression since around 6-7th grade, and i’ve also had anxiety for basically my entire life. recently i’ve been trying to get treatment for my intense joint pain which might be fibromyalgia, but because of covid medical treatment is 1000x slower and i can’t get any pain relief. the illness has made my mental health plummet and i’ve been suicidal for months. i’ve started to self harm a few months ago. i’m about to take a bottle of extra strength tylenol just to see what would happen. and to have an excuse to not do my schoolwork and to have people pity me. i don’t care if it hurts, im already already in constant pain. im not sure if i’ll be sent to a psych ward, and i really don’t want to go to one. but i don’t have anyone to talk to about this. please."
depression,"My cat and I We both sleep more hours than we are awake

Sunlight makes us sleepy

We both prefer liquid calories"
depression,Possible diagnosis After many years of being prescribed various antidepressants and courses of CBT &amp; NLT etc they seem to think I have ASD and possibly ADHD. I'm now 50 years old and hopefully I may come to some kind of resolution as the end of the tether is getting ever closer. Be safe people.
depression,"heavy heart i feel absolute numbness right now and i deeply wish there was another way or another answer, i feel so fucking sick and tired, all the yelling and screaming and crying just makes my face hurt but man i don’t know how much longer i can do this."
depression,"having a hard time continuing just feel so alone, even though there are people I can talk to I feel like I can't.  just been bruising my legs and arms until it hurts to even move them"
depression,I’m tired. So me and my wife have been together for 6 years. We have 2 kids together. We also have been building a house together for over a year. Our marriage has never been perfect but it’s never been horrible. I found out today what seems to be out of no where that my wife wants to leave me and take the kids. Her parents are furious with her and I’m trying my hardest to be understanding and help. But… I haven’t slept in at least 3 days and every 30 minutes I’m having a mental break down. I’m exhausted and I don’t think I can keep doing this before something gives. I just don’t know what do. I’ve built my entire life around this person mentally and financially. I’ve scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and I hope it helps. But I really just want to be able to sleep..
depression,"idk what to do with myself 18M. ever since i can remember, ive never been confident in my looks, my academics, anything. i can never find one trait i have that is somehwat nice to have. i spend every single day, every hour, in my room. doing nothing but be on my pc all day. ive always lived with my mom and sister, father died when i was almost 1yr old. i know it impacted her life a lot. writing this with tears falling down my face. this post has no structure and im just ranting. ive never had a job, all 3 relationships ive ever had ended very harshly for me. what do i bring to the table? im being a waste of space and money. my mom does so much to take care of me and my sister. i feel like the worst human on earth for being a waste. i bring in no money. not bubbly and outgoing as i used to be when i was 14/ thing have been getting worse every year. ive attempted before. wrote so many letters when i thought itd be my last day. i thought i would never see the day of my 18th bday. my bday is next month and here i am thinking the same thing. every day is just a repeat. i feel like my depression, extreme monotone voice and lack of emotion just brings everyone down with me. whats my purpose here? i cant think of any positives. money is wasted on me. food is wasted on me. i wish i could just end it but i know how devastated my mom and little sister would be. i honestly dont see a future ahead of me. i dont have any strengths, no career plan, no real friends. i spend every single day alone in this room living the same day over and over and over again. i just dont know how long i can keep up. at this age im seeing people move on from highschool, people going to college to live out their true dreams. i just cant find a dream, a reason, something to grip on to keep me here. im just so lost, i feel so guilty. i feel bad for my family. one day when my older family dies around me, i can already imagine the guilt i would have. i just dont know what my purpose is. i dont want my aura of depression to effect my household. i just want to vanish without a trace. if there was a way to kill myself without anyone having a memory of me, id do it in an instant. i just want my mom to know that im in my worst state but she already have 10x more on her plate. i dont want to bother her. but idk how much longer i can keep going. i dont want to age. i dont want kids. i dont want to get better. at this point im ok with death. im extremely lost and dont know what to do. i wish i could live a normal care-free life. ive been having the urge to cut again. i really want to but i dont want anyone to accidently see. idk. thanks for reading."
depression,"I’m tired of putting my family through this. I have these rituals where I force myself to be appreciative of everyone and everything in my life. I imagine the impact my death would have on my loved ones and I go on evening though I know I’m going to have to start the process over tomorrow. The thing is it doesn’t really work anymore. I know what my death will do to those I love but I am so tired. I’ve spent the last 30 years fighting everyday. I don’t want to do this anymore. My current state of mind is that time heals all and my family will move on with time. 

I wish I could be stronger/healthier for them."
depression,"i really wanna die.... i dont know what to do to be okay (F19) i really wanna be happy, i want to stop feeling like shit everytime
i tried psychologist, medication, doctors, discussion group. what should i do? i cant rly control these thoughts. im rly thinking about killing myself....
i cant even live a normal life, cant even be happy
i wanna stop everything"
depression,"Silent dread and desperation Not sure if it's my meds or my brain but it's hard for me to hang in there much longer.

Part of me is incredibly sad and lonely. I fantasize about being dead often. I think of hanging, shooting or ODing daily. 

As much as I try to be upbeat and positive, internally I'm dead inside.

I don't feel appreciated, seen or cared for. At this point I'm hanging on bc I don't want to go before my dog does.

Fuuuuuk, I don't look depressed but what's going on behind my eyes is pretty grim."
depression,"tired of trying to get better i’ve tried new meds every 6 weeks for 2 years now and none of them worked. i’m out of options, and things aren’t getting better. i’m so so tired and i don’t know what to do. feel like ending things just to get a break from this shitty life"
depression,"If one keeps failing at something smart thing to do would be quit it and try something else. So why I shouldn't quit life and try being dead maybe I will be happy then Graduated this year thought it would be a normal year I was wrong it's been worst I have tragedies just keep on coming one after another I can't recover from previous one and another one knocks.


My uncle one of the closest person in my life died in my arms and I couldn't do anything I let him die.


Other people in my family just don't recognize me as a person even.


The person I love who I thought loved me says loves me but acts worse than a stranger told her I have a terminal neurological disorder and she says 'ok'.


What the fuck I m suppose to do"

depression,"How to deal with parents not believing you during a major depression Yesterday I got the diagnosis of a major depression, i've been feeling pretty bad for over a month now. I have the luck of a good psychologist and a job that is understanding and I can work part time for 2 weeks now... 

But now i'm worried because my mother is often at home and she doesn't believe i'm depressed since I never show or cry it to her. Last times I cried, she got mad at me and yelled at me thinking i'm high and on drugs. anyways... she'll just think i'm lazy and want to stay home to game.

how do you guys deal with abusive parents at home who don't believe you?"
depression,"I feel so incredibly empty inside, as if my life has no purpose I (male, 31) moved to the other side of the earth a couple years ago in search of fulfillment, but the emptiness just moved with me. I wanna change so badly, but I don’t know how to. My bachelor’s degree is worthless, I don’t know what I want to do in terms of my career, i don’t feel good/useful at anything, I struggle with limiting beliefs/negative self-talk 24/7, I’m incredibly lonely as I can’t hold any meaningful relationships due to depression… I just wanna get away from this world and never look back. I wish the world would just open itself up and bury me in its depths.

How do you find meaning in life? How do you give your life a sense of purpose? How do you generate the feeling that you actually matter? That your life matter?"
depression,"I hate you Depression Imagine something or someone you used to love the most, imagine how that feels to care for them and the warm feeling you feel inside. 
Now imagine something you care absolutely nothing about, for me that’s Hockey, I couldn’t care less about the sport of Hockey, have never watched or have even been remotely interested. 

Now picture that thing or person in front of you that you love and replace the inner being of it with the feeling of the thing you don’t care about, the nothingness that comes with it. 

The object of your past desire is still there, you remember being in love with this person or thing that brought you joy but it’s been hollowed out and replaced with nothingness. 

You still see it, but you couldn’t care less the color is gone, the life is gone .. that’s what depression is. 

I hate this illness, it’s already taken so much   of my life that I can never get back."
depression,"It's the cycle, it's draining me I recently moved to another state for my college and the online colleges were pretty fucking depressing and I thought coming offline would be much easier, but it has been worse lately, people don't get me here, I don't have much friends here rn, there's a girl I found interesting and I wanna know about her more and wanna hangout, but the second year is of fucking 8 months and they're rushing the syllabus like anything, it's getting exhausting, the work is killing me really, I wanna improve myself a lot, in other fields like I am improving my sketching style and preparing for the contests, but it's really tiresome and the cycle goes on and on until you get exhausted and run out of breath, I want someone in my life about whom I can care about but it's so confusing and so fucking messed up, I'm really tired and I wanna improve this, help me someone, please."
depression,"Alone yay Me against the world everytime. Everday. :) No one is on my side, and everything is my fault. All good ofcourse. I'm always wrong anyways right. It's my fault it's my fault it's my fault it's my fault."
depression,I'm jealous of people those who enjoy life I've gotten to the point where I'm living just to exist. Surviving in modern society really isnt anything to live for.
depression,"It's almost 4 am. But that's typical for me, what not typical? I'm already in bed, but surprise (not really) I can't sleep. Because I cried. Because my brain won't shut up. I feel so alone. And it turns out, I have a fear of being alone. Out of the 13 people I know, I only feel confident that two of them actually care about me.

The rest...

My ex, who only loves me like a sister now. But we don't talk a lot (I'm still hurting) 

A friend who says he wants a relationship but doesn't make a lot of effort to talk to me.

A friend who's been like like a sister to me for 3 years suddenly stopped talking to me.

A friend who wants to support me, but we don't really connect most of the time.

A friend who is taking a break from messaging and social media, and I may not hear from again, considering her own struggles with depression.

A friend who stopped showing interest in talking to me.

A friend who really only talks to me because his fiancé and I have known each other for a couple years.

A friend (the fiancé) with whom I struggle to connect.

Another friend, whom I consider a mother figure, too busy to communicate.

A friend who considers me an aunt to his newborn child, we rarely talk.

And a friend with whom I have little in common, but we share memes."
depression,Has medicine helped anyone I am in therapy and recently psychiatry. I got put on ssris and I’m just skeptical of being dependent on some pill to help me get better. Anyone with experience here that can help me out
depression,I got told it would end My gf told me the relaitonship will end in the summer of 2022 since she is moving to the other side of the world. She is my 8th gf and I got dumped every single time. I am feeling more depressed then ever. I love her like no other and wanted to be with her for the rest of my life. And now we can't. I just want to cry but I cant cause I'm at school. I want to punch a hole in the wall. I want to rip myself apart I wish she could stay with other family but she can't her parents don't allow it.
depression,Can’t finish what I start I recently started to learn french but I gave up already after only couple of days. I always struggle to finish what I start and I feel really bad about it. I feel I’m wasting my youth and time doing nothing .
depression,"How to stop self-awareness? I'm tired of thinking about myself. Tired of trying to understand myself as if i was going to find the solution to all of my problems there. I always end up feeling bad.

It seems like other people never really stop to think about why they are the way they are. It seems like they are so happy with themselves. I want to be like that. 

I don't even have depression. I just want get out of my own head and stop reflecting over every little feeling i have and every action i take."
depression,"This life thing has a funny sense of humour If a random individual were to see me from the outside they would see a happy character, smiling, laughing with his friends, socialising… On the inside I’m an absolute mess, and I can’t tell anyone. Why on the inside it just feels like I’m a black cloud. I’m happy to be a post for someone to lean on during hard times. I’ll gladly listen to their stories. I even encourage others to speak about their experiences. But I will NEVER express my own, what a hypocrite. Why, because I’m the post you lean on, I’m the listener, I’m the happy go lucky one. When others make snarky remakes towards me, they hurt a lot but I just laugh them off, even if they diminish my self worth. Why because I’m the post, I don’t get to bite back, I’m sturdy I’m there to be leaned on… I’m sturdy. If it wasn’t for the fear of dying I would be gone, but alas I wake up everyday continuing the cycle of trying to be the post. What a joke."
depression,I’m alone I was so stupid for thinking anyone could help me
depression,"Forgetfulness I feel that forgetfulness is not commonly talked about as a symptom of depression. I always had a bad memory and I just forget a huge chunk of important events. I used to get very frustrated that a lot of people talk about shows they loved as kids and scenes they remember. People tend to tell very detailed stories that happened in their childhood, and I just can’t do that. I didn’t realize that this was a symptom of depression and trauma until recently. My dad was talking about a trip we took a few years ago, and I completely forgot we actually went on that trip until he talked about it, but it felt like it was a dream not a memory. He was talking about it in details like it was yesterday, but I couldn’t recall anything he said. I try documenting some of my daily life because I know in a few years I’m gonna forget all of this again."
depression,"I'm losing alot of hair, stressing about it, and losing more as a result. I honestly can't take it anymore. For context I'm 18M. I always knew that I won't be having alot of hair looking at my father, but I never thought that this day would come so early. The last year or so have been bad for me. I've lost contact with all my so called friends, attend online college lectures and I feel overwhelmed and confused about my future and feel like a failure.

Losing a bunch of hair everytime I shampoo my hair was the last thing I needed. I mean I've never seen an 18yo looking like he's approaching middle age but here I am. I always curse my father for having me despite knowing what it feels like. Honestly, my dreams when I sleep seem more exciting than my real life. I have nothing to look forward to. No meaning at all. It really feels like I'm stuck in a loop, I'll get a degree, get a job, work everyday, and then just die.

I'm new to this sub so I'm sorry if it feels like a petty problem compared to others in this sub. I didn't know where else to post this and needed to rant coz I have no one else to talk to irl."
depression,Trying to survive life but what’s the point if I’m so traumatized and damaged when the good times finally come? Life is too much and it’s hard to cope after going through everything. Therapy and medication doesn’t fix anything
depression,Damaged I’m dealing with vocal damage from a mental breakdown where I screamed like crazy. I’m so sad and regretful about it because I feel like music is the only thing that matters in day to day life. The only thing that brings simple joy and now I hate the sound of my voice. It really makes me want to die. Plus I have hearing loss. I just feel like I destroyed my perfectly good health due to mental instability. And all I ever wanted was to be a good pretty boy.
depression,"Long Post Hello Reddit, (or however you begin a post)

I have only commented on things on Reddit a few times. No original posts. Mostly just come here for video game questions and stuff like that. Reddit is always super helpful and the people seem less toxic than many other sites. I'm not really active on the internet because it makes my depression and anxiety flare up. 

Anyway, I started composing a post and it got really long before I was done... I don't know if that is allowed on here or if people would even take the time to read something so long, let alone comment on the post. Is that ok? If so, would it just be a waste of my time?

I would really appreciate a response on this letting me know. I know one of the rules says something about advice but I figure this is alright to ask on here. If not, please let me know."
depression,I don't wanna wake up anymore I've been praying to God to not wake me up anymore. I don't want to be here. I don't belong here.
depression,"Im so tired of this and im not sure I can take much more So, recently has been... tough for me, I already have depression and anxiety which doesnt help but I need to get this off my chest even if im just throwing a rock into a pond. Anyways for years and years my father wasnt the best parent some of the shit that happened between us was... bad to say the least you see, He used to hit me and my siblings a lot as a form of group punishment and that wasnt all too much fun. A really nasty custody battle took place between him and my mom me and my siblings were getting hit so much it had to be put into the court order group punishment was forbidden, and that brings us to about now... So a while back I found out I may be trans/ non-binary and went into exploring that identity and found out I was, but at the time I didnt tell my father and kinda just hid it. Eventually I confronted him about it and he didnt really say anything on it... and by nothing I mean nothing he refused to refer to me as I wanted to be referred to as which was uncomfortable but I didnt raise a fuss I understood not everyone was going to accept me as I was. So I also have an 11 year old sibling I will not name him because privacy, but my father was driving him to school the night after I told the 11 y/o I was trans which he didnt have the problem, He asked my dad why he was also the last to be told about things like people being trans. He told mouse that he typically was told about these things then when he brought up me my father said: ""Well Ari doesnt have the genital's that would describe him as anything but a guy! He thinks like a guy, acts like a guy and is a guy."" He told my brother that I was a ""Selfish, Heartless person who only cared about myself"" Hes trying to turn my brother against me... Hes trying to make my own little brother not like me.... I dont know what to do about this anymore because my father hates me and maybe he has a point... Maybe I just dont know myself, I feel like im just hanging in there by a thread and time is blurring like it did a while ago when I got super depressed I dont see how I can resolve this, In the past I talked about the abuse I went through with him and my step mom and he found it so I decided you know what I will be the bigger person in this relationship and I reached out to him and apologized for talking about him and my step mom without bringing my issues straight to them. They have been saying all sorts of awful things about me and just degrading and hating me and im not sure how much more I can take, Can someone help me? Im not sure with what tbh.... maybe a resolve? Maybe to help accept the fact my father may never actually love me? Im not sure what I need but I can tell you... I dont think its ""this"" whatever this is... Im not the problem am I? and do yall think its ok for him to try to turn my brother against me? I mean it is his kid but it feels really wrong...."
depression,"Chronic experience of heaviness has devolved into disembodied television static Disembodied television static. A monotone hiss pervades the air.  External positive radiation slides like rain on a windshield. Faces and places are blurred. Prosopagnosia. The perception of time is subjective. An ephemeral moment of levity provides a breath of relief. Petrichor wafts from freshly wet soil. A moment of quiet. Centered. Present. Endorphins are a hug from a long lost friend. Congestion is cleared. Unconscious and resting. The fog settled in the winter, its corpse hangs heavy on the back once more. Bewildered by rigor mortis. Restless. Magic hour. Dark circles peer into perpetual morning haze. Defense mechanisms soften loud noises. Disembodied television static."
depression,"I forgot i had a plug in back massager that i lay on Lol I forgot about it since last Christmas when i used it non stop for days and end up getting bruises 

Im so calm right now getting my neck massaged by it about to fall asleep

Today was good i cleaned my depression cave quite a bit, walked to Starbucks this morning, and now I’m about to peacefully fall asleep

Could this be my first happy day in months? It feels nice i hope tomorrow is like this :)"
depression,"Venting I stood in the rain for 40 minutes instead of going to my lectures and then went back to my dorm(that I never stay at) and now I'm sitting here like a dumbass. I feel so guilty knowing my parents spent money on this because I geniunely hate this major and it's been making my depression hell. I walked into an art store and I almost cried because this only thing I had going in my life and I did nothing with it, the only thing I feel is keeping me alive. Now I'm stuck with maths and programming and seeing people passionate when I know nothing and understand nothing. I've always been depressed but it's been a while I've had this kind of legitimate sadness that it bring me to tears almost everyday. I don't know who to turn to, I don't know who to talk to. Im geniunely thinking I might not make it long even though I don't really want to end it all, but I feel so hopeless."
depression,"Turning 24 in 4 days I'm so scared. Birthdays are supposed to be happy. I'm dreading it so so much. I'm such a failure. Fking hell I'm so fking old and good for nothing idiot moron. I'm such a loser. I did nothing this year. Nothing. 

I mean I tried but I just can't conctrate. Absolutely idiotic brain. Feel like it's so useless to even try. I do well for 2 weeks then fking back to square one. Same story for one whole year. Holy fuck just going to end myself. Jesus 24. 24 fking hell. I got like no career, no good relationships. Honestly ugly as shit. Fking hell ."
depression,"The immediate assumption that kind people are lying to you: How can you tell when people mean it? I honestly cannot tell whether people genuinely believe in me or if they’re only saying it to make me feel better about myself. Sometimes I wonder if everyone is lying to me about my potential the way Sulley lied to Mike in Monsters University because they know to do otherwise would crush my will to live cause my ambitions are the only thing fuelling it. Best to keep the idiot with delusions of grandeur in the dark about their own incompetence so they don’t off themselves after realising they have no means of making their goals a reality, amirite? I know I should be grateful I have these people in my life at all but even admission to my dream school feels like a whole lifetime away and I’m just so depressed thinking about my goals when I can’t even make the first step a reality despite trying so hard…."
depression,"I can't get up I've been in bed for about 5 weeks, I get up to use the bathroom, and occasionally eat or shower, but other than that I'm mostly in bed.
This bed so uncomfortable, I have back problems, laying here ruined me, I'm in pain all the time, I'm hungry, I close the blinds so there's no sunlight. But I can't get up.
I woke up extremely weak a few nights ago, I wondered if it the lack of sunlight so I called a to consult a medical professional, they said ""get yourself to urgent care"" so I went and they took my money and told me they can't do anything and ""got yourself to the ER"", so I did, and I waited for 5 hours until finally at 3am I got to see someone who said ""I can't help you"". I can't be admitted cause I'm not suicidal, I'm not exactly malnourished or fatigued enough to need hospitalization either, I'm waiting on a psychiatrist appointment in a month, that's when I start my therapy but until then I'm on my own. So I crawled back into this shitty bed.
I'm sick of this room, I hate the darkness that I stare into all day everyday. I miss my friends, who all probably hate me cause I didn't return their texts or pick up their calls when I first stopped going out. I went to class one time 2 weeks ago and one of them said ""you need to man up, you can't keep mssing class""
I can't help it. I'm scared."
depression,"I'm a failure and disappointment I was supposed to start my 2nd year of uni. I didn't pass my first so i wanted to study the classes from my first year again. I forgot to apply and now I'm without uni and without money. My mum and my sister passed away and in my country there's a law that you can get 50% salary of your deceased parent das long as you're studying something. I was in very bad place last year and honestly i couldn't do anything. I would lock myself in my room and just play video games because that was the only thing that cleared my mind. Now it's too late to apply for uni and I can't do it until February. I can't get the money either. I told everyone that I passed my 1st year because i wanted everyone to look at me as this always happy and smart guy but in reality I can't do anything because I'm feeling depressed. My mum felt like she's going to pass away so she made me promise her that I'll study but her death just hit me so hard then my sister's suicide hit me even harder. Now my dad wants to see if i actually passed my 1st year. I never lie but about that i lied simply because i didn't want to let people see what's going on with me. Now i feel like I'm a failure and disappointed everyone in life. I just want to rip my whole skin and stop existing. I don't know how to tell anyone about this. I don't know even if i can tell my dad. Even tho my friends are always asking me how i am, I don't want to show them the reality that I'm just sad and unable to do anything because of my thoughts because i think they'll look at me differently. I know everyone would support me but i just don't want them to see me vulnerable. Now i feel like whatever i do is not enough. I don't want to break people's trust. I think i went from the most trustworthy person to someone no one can trust. I haven't told anyone about this. Everyone still thinks i passed the 1st year and I'm in an excellent place. I don't know what to do. I don't want to exist but seeing what my sister's suicide brought is making me realize that's that is even more selfish"
depression,"Am I depressed? (F18) I’ve just turned 18. I’m an introvert, and I have been diagnosed with anxiety by my therapist. 

I actually hate therapy. All I do is listen to her go on and on about things I already know. I don’t have problems big enough to talk about, and I’m not at the right point in life to begin healing my childhood trauma just yet. So what do I say? 

I hate who I am. I’m disappointed that I turned into the person I swore I could never become. 

I’ve been through so many lows over the past 5 years. Especially through covid and toxic friendships and family issues. After each low point I’d get marginally better again but I have never returned to my energetic and free state of life.

I just feel numb. I never have any energy at all. I can’t truly enjoy my life, even if I’m seemingly having fun, as I’m just so tired all the time. I’m constantly having existential thoughts. Sometimes I remove myself from my body altogether. I go days feeling like I am in a dream. The world around me feeling blurred. And then I have days when I feel completely normal, however the normal doesn’t even feel worth it. So much energy on… what??? A mediocre life? 

I struggle to stand when brushing my teeth. I struggle to clean. I used to be able to but I just cant at the moment. It’s impossible. I used to be able to think clearly, but everything is foggy and my memory is worse than ever. 

I have incredibly low self esteem. I look in the mirror quite often and just stare. And then I cry. Life is just so bloody hard. Why are we focussed on going through life like every single other person. Shallow relationships. Marriage. Kids. A house and a dog. Like it MADDENS me. Why does this life make no sense?? And I say that with deep love and connection with my dog. And the 2 year old toddler I babysit part-time. I absolutely adore him. It’s not that I hate these things it’s that they feel odd. Meaningless? 

I think I’m talented. I’m creative. I can be fun. I’m extremely compassionate and empathetic. I’m intuitive. I’m sure a lot of people truly would support me. But I feel so insanely unloved. No one notices me struggling every single day. I would oftentimes arrive to school in tears over my life at home and people would ask if I was okay. But no one would follow up. Not even my “friends”. Everyone cares about themselves but don’t seem to notice anyone else. Ever. 

I don’t know what the point in posting this is. I doubt anyone will read all of this nonsense. I’m probably just young and naive and have imbalanced teenage hormones for all I know. However, even if one person could validate these feelings. I may feel a little bit better? Even regardless of my ability to get up every day to work and attempt social life that I am indeed struggling internally. Everyday. A massive weight I carry around on my shoulders. 

Until this year I have cringed at the word depression. I could never have depression. I’m bubbly and warm and caring and somewhat have passions in life. But I lack motivation. I have overwhelming social anxiety. I overthink everything. I feel exhausted every single hour of every single day.

So is that a form of depression or am I just a normal teen? Or is it something else? 

Is life truly this hard for everyone?"
depression,"Ayo Honestly I’m not feeling very well, I feel empty inside, and the only thing that can make me feel just a little bit, is drugs…
Im on my seventh bag in 12 hours, and I’m just hopping that I overdose at this point"
depression,"I just want to not exist anymore I just turned 22 today, and I feel like my life's wasting away in front of me. Every goal I set doesn't get met. Every day is the same. I wake up the same person everyday, no change no progress. I feel like I'm going to stay this way my entire life, like I'm going to die this way. I don't know if I can take another 50 years of this, I just want to fade away. I don't want to feel anything anymore."
depression,"Please help - either towards a better state, or towards death. I (F19) have been struggling with depression since I was 12. I’ve thought about it for a while and I don’t think anything specific brought it in. In the past 7 years I’ve also gained PTSD. Suicidal thoughts probably started when I was 13/14?

My first time attempting was when I was 14. My most recent attempt was when I was 16. I fantasise about suicide sometimes. Sometimes it’s about other peoples reactions at my funeral. Other times it’s about a loved one finding me, either bleeding out, hanging, ODing, etc. But most of the time, the suicidal thoughts are a “need” - no romanticism or fantasising.

When I’m in those states, I shut down. I can’t concentrate on anything BUT the urge to stop what I’m doing, go home, and find a way to end my life without others having to deal with the aftermath. Sometimes the thoughts would last for minutes, or in some cases, years.

I have recently moved states. One of my serious plans of suicide included moving away from my friends and family, cutting off contact with them, and ending my life without a trace. The thought of that plan has recently resurfaced and the stress from my new job isn’t helping. I feel like I’m going insane. I feel like I’m trying so hard to survive, and nothing good has, or ever will, come out of it.

I just want to cease to exist. I’m so sick of getting in the way of everyone’s lives. Maybe I need some kind of suicide encouragement to get me over the line? Maybe I need some kind of “set plan” to help me decide how I should die. Or maybe I need encouragement to live?"
depression,"I don’t understand how to be alive Is existing not an immense struggle for everyone else too? It seems like everything I do, every change I make, the positivity I feel from it is quickly fleeting. Two days ago I made a big decision to move because that was the only way I could bargain myself into being alive and already I’ve grown bored with the idea. 

I don’t understand how people just *do things*. It takes all my energy to compete even the most minor of tasks and instead of it being something to start a snowball of positive changes it simply exhausts me and without realizing I feel compelled to do something harmful and self destructive.

Been taking my SNRI’s for months, I don’t get why I have to live like this."
depression,"Writing my suicide note I can't live with the guilt and shame. I can't live with the knowledge of my mistakes if you can even call them that because I think I'm just making excuses for being a bad person because you can't keep doing and saying bad things and think it's okay because it's a ""mistake"" and all is forgiven. It doesn't work like that. No matter how much reassurance I have it will never be enough. Society's opinion means everything to me. Everyone's opinion means everything to me. I don't want to be viewed as a bad person. I can't tell anyone about my past in fear of being judged and hated. I mean we all have skeletons in our closets. I wish I were a child again. Just care free and everything was a lot simpler. I wish time machines exist or spells where you can change the past. I wish reset buttons were real. I wish I wasn't such a piece of shit. I wish my family weren't so ignorant. I wish everyone knew how sorry I am. If my family knew the person I have become they would hate me. I miss my grandma. I wish technology never existed it is the worst invention ever made but that's ironic because I'm using it right now. I find comfort in knowing other people's ""mistakes"" especially if they are worse than mine because then I know I'm not alone but I am really. I find that quite toxic of me. I'm so alone in my thoughts. I hate everything about myself. I'm sorry."
depression,"I am tried of this shit. I have been avoiding self harm for past 2 years. It's so hard. Bec of that I had to find something which I enjoy and get burnout every time. I brought minecraft just bec I know I will have great time exploring and chill. Which I can't do irl anyway. I know it's pretty addictive so that's why I only play minecraft weekly once. I just want to tell my parents that I play any game just so that I don't eat drowned in my sucidal thoughts. I have been doing this from 5th class and never told anything about this. But after I came out about my depression. They changed no freedom, no privacy, no happiness.. Why? Just so that I can be ""happy"". I kept some hope in them just so that they will be happy. At this point, I am scared of myself.  U might think it's just a kid ranting about how she can't play games. I don't know any other copping methods. I had been having symptoms from the time I am able to remember shit in my life. My whole pre-teen was just me secretly crying every night about how I'm so scared to go to school. Trying not cry at school. Being so tried to go tuition and try to be happy just so that they don't call my parents. Coming home dead inside every fucking day.  I just don't remember anything which made happy from my primary school age. The only thing which I remember using was just listernig to music and playing games. It made me not think of my life which is slowly ruining every sec. Covid 19 hit me hard like a train. Being locked up in a dark room. Rarely coming out. Just crying every day. At a point where dark rooms started slowly comforting me. No one was there to tell me shittly advice every day. No one asked me. No one talked to me. My only friend was also started having alot suicidal thoughts and I was always there to comfort her. While I was trying not hurt myself just bec i promised my first online friend to not hurt myself. It was tempting. There were sharpener every where. Just me trying get it's blade out. Just seeing it. Having meltdown every time and my parents banging on the door scares me.i listened to the same advice every single day at a point where I started panicking when ever they started talking. Just not able cry in the house. After my parents toke me therapist. The only thing which helped me is sleeping. It makes me so happy when ever I feel dozy. Just the feeling of dying. Now took My mom's seeing and they didn't ask me anything. They stopped giving us tablets. I have not been able to sleep for the past month . I just want sleep. I want to talk to people without thinking what they are thinking about me. I don't want overthink. I just to sleep. Everything is hard. I'm growing up everyday. I'm not seen as a child EVEN THO IM STILL A CHILD. Studies are getting hard. I tried everything. Writing. Sewing going out. Walking. Talking. Nothing. I just want to stop breathing. My mom wants me to try religion. I hate God so much. If he cared for us why would he kill us. Why would we be depressed. What is he doing? Doesn't he has like 100 more people to give responsibility to take care of us. Why would be give us depression. Thank you. U can ignore now u worked hard for who ever reading this. Thank you again for giving your time to read this."
depression,"Recovery has been really bad for me Im finally starting to recover from depression and anxiety, I know it will take a long time probably years. But at least I’m on my way. But here the things for me I have never felt this bad. My mood swings are extreme. One day I feel alright the next I’m crashing, I have never been this close to taking my own life. I have never felt this bad. My depression usually makes me feel numb, it feel likes my life goes on autopilot. But now I feel sad, angry, hopeless, tired, scared, i hate myself, I feel dead inside, disgusting, ashamed, dumb, I just want it all to stop.

I know this probably have something to do with me turning off my emotions for years. And now I’m slowly starting to let me feel emotions again. That probably a good thing but I seriously don’t know how to handle all these feelings."
depression,"Depression keeps taking everything from me I'm supposed to graduate from university today. I had to defer a semester to get some help and sometimes i wish i didn't just so i'd be able to share this moment with my friends.

I feel like it took my friends from me, the only family that truly gets me. Now i'm alone in school and they have started their lives and i wish i was part of it. I wish i could be there with them.

It hurts cause I'm truly proud of them, I love them with all my heart and I know how much they deserve this. They all work so hard and we could have done this together.

I feel miserable"
depression,"Escaping Reality. I don't really think I have depression, but whenever I sit down and really think about how life has been going for the past few years, it really makes me depressed and realize how harsh reality really is. It feels like nothing has been going right for the past 4 years. Not in my education, not in my family matters, not even between my parents or my entire family in general. I am just turning 21 soon and I know I am still young but does it really need to be this hard? I don't realize the reality around me mainly because I always try to occupy myself and try to not think about it too much but sooner or later it catches up to me. I just feel like a mess and look like a mess and feel like I am falling behind in everything compared to my friends. Just felt like venting about this stuff somewhere since I am not really open to talk about stuff like this with my family or friends so here I am on this reddit typing my heart out."
depression,"i decided that im gonna take my life soon i argued with my mum last night about college and how it’s killing me inside lmao

i think i have adhd but i might not even get to find out whether i do or not because i’m still on the waiting list and have been for months. on top of that i’m severely and clinically depressed and have been for five years or so. i’m a former gifted kid who somehow had both a superiority and inferiority complex coupled with an insane amount of general, health and social anxiety as well as a crippling obsession with god religion. i’m now an atheist who doesn’t believe in god but still fears hell and is overly conscious of “sinning”. 

i dropped out of sixth form in 2020 because i would have killed myself if i had to continue and i went to college hoping it would be better but it’s more of the same. i was in therapy for two years and it didn’t help. ive been on medication for 5 months and they helped at first but then i became more depressed than i’ve ever been in all my 17 years and it gets 10x worse by the day. 

i have plenty of friends. i’m smart, but i struggle with writing. i work in sales three or four days a week. i liked work before i became so depressed. i like to draw. i wanted to make a show when i’m older. my parents say they care and want to help me, but they’ve also said very hurtful things that have never left my mind. they’re somehow both half the reason i’m still around because i dont want to hurt them, but they are also half the reason i’m going to kill myself.

i feel like school has failed me. therapy and meds have failed me. honestly it feels like my parents have failed me too. nothing helps, i don’t think anything will help, so i will end things myself. i am not made for this world"
depression,"Depression doesn't need a reason, but holy shit there's so many I know that plenty of people are depressed without having a trigger event/situation related to it. I know that depression is a thing that can happen to anyone regardless of how their life looks— whether theyre rich and successful and loved or not. 

But holy shit. When i think about my own depression (I have dysthymia, and have been constantly depressed to diff extents since I was about 11) I can't think of anything BUT the reasons. A history of experiencing physical and emotional abuse, transphobia, homophobia, ableism, the burden of being an immigrant with limited access to certain resources that non-immigrants take for granted, the uncertainty of whether I can afford to exi$t in the near future. It's just too much. I feel like every single reason stacks up and shows me the exact ways in which this world is built to push me out.

I'm hoping maybe some of you relate a bit, and can share ways in which you've dealt with these feelings/things that help you when they pop up? 

(not sure if this post is the kinda thing that this subreddit is for, sorry if not!)"
depression,small things i worry about What do I write on my college essay application? I'm not passionate about shit. I just want a normal fucking life.

depression,"finally checking myself in as a inpatient at a clinic to get the help i need. current life is a living hell worried about every pain and symptom i get..  my life has turned into a living hell and have never struggled as much as i have to date. i'v ruined all friendships and even my relationship with my girlfriend is under strain because of how i am. i am worried 24/7 about every little ache or pain or symptom i get. i have vision issues, muscles aches, dizzyness, you name it. i walk around thinking i am dying and im supposed to act like im fine. im 30 and live at home still. no job or any qualifications. but whatever, atleast im gonna get the help i need i guess. it's just the waiting to go as a inpatient that is killing me. each day is a fucking struggle and i gotta wait another couple weeks for my insurance to kick in so i can go in private. not sure what else to say really."
depression,"My depression has linked itself to love; it flares up when I fall for someone I guess I am chronically depressed, and have been so since childhood. I was overburdened and neglected when young, and it probably just got drilled into my mind. It is consistent and mostly low level (maybe dysthymia?) but has one very cruel feature: it explodes whenever I fall in love. I think the dynamic is this: thanks to the chronic depression and other setbacks, I am a massive underachiever. The kind where people think ""why the hell do you work here""? So there is a pretty severe gap between the people I click with, and my social reality. 

Because of this, I have a history of attraction to (and of) people above my league. Like, more content people. Achievers. And that means, getting close to them reminds me of a lot of unresolved stuff. I just buried so many dreams when I was in my teens and 20s, it is very hard to bear looking at it so I usually just don´t. My condition gets worse when love stirs that up. It pushes me back down in the deep pit, and that is not a place to invite someone to. 

So yeah, that is basically what happens every time I met someone good. I had one long relationship, very important for me but it was a connection with a very strong platonic element (we are best friends today). Interestingly, that one was different although the socioeconomic gap was there as always. But it wasn't the kind where you're on fire for someone. I experienced that classic ""in love"" thing three times, at 18, at 27 and now again at 41, and every time I withdrew from the person acutely depressed, taking months to recover and with physical effects as well. 

Apart from the torment, it also feels ridiculous for an adult to do this. I am at my wits end how to un-link this."

I have a very good female friend that is a year older than me and i love talking w her but we cant always see each other. I feel like im alone and i feel empty.

Please help idk what to do anymore"
depression,"I don’t know a what to do Hello I don’t make text posts but I want to write this down so it is less of a bother in my head.

I feel like it’s getting bad again. I went through a really bad and really long depressive episode recently, and I’ve come out of it since — but maybe not completely.

I’m not sure how to explain this but I’ve identified things I did during that time that I see as “typical things I do because I am depressed” — eg. convince myself that my ‘friends’ are complete strangers, ruin my sleep schedule, quit my job, (and so on).

So basically, I feel like I’m falling down into my stupid spiral again. These ‘things’ I’ve identified have just become a fun game of bingo, and I’m slowly checking each stupid box off once more. It’s concerning, yet I can’t do anything to stop it. I have work tomorrow morning and I’m actively allowing myself to lose hours of sleep. Maybe quitting my job is the next box I cross off.

I hate feeling like this, and I don’t want to burden my parents with this concern again. My depression is making it all-too-tempting to fuck everything up again.

Thank you for putting up with my mess of a rant, I just needed it out of my head !"
depression,Wanna see if the other side is better. Seriously tho so done rn in so sad and angry at same time. Miss my wife but feeling not mutual and trust was obliterated completely now she trying to make me suffer more like tf  what I do after the fact. Wasn’t me. U know that. But anyway I’ll always live u some kinda way. Gonna kill all social media tonrow I just need to get on grind time. But I’m sabotaging myself. I’m just a dirtbag fr tho. Fuck it.
depression,"damn it, I should’ve never drank that frappe My anxiety is through the roof now. I mean…..my freaking arms are shaking and my ffucking heart keeps dropping to my a—hole. I can’t sleep. I’m paranoid af too. Might be up for another hour or two."
depression,My mom told me to “have a good day”. This is what I wanted to say. How messed up am I? There’s no such thing as good or evil. They are a creation of the human mind that we use to rationalize our choices. And I don’t believe that life or the world that humans have created is “good”. I think if it someone were to rate earth on a scale of good vs evil it would be more evil than good. So it’s hard to have a good day when I don’t really see anything good about life or the world we live in :(
depression,"Realization I recently realized I’m depressed.

On Thanksgiving, a friend who had just finalized his divorce that week reached out to me. I rudely told him he was just lonely and he responded no, I reached out because I know you’re lonely and alone on thanksgiving and you’re depressed.

Depressed? I thought to myself. Am I depressed? I thought about it the next few days. I realized I hadn’t cooked a meal in over a month. I loved cooking. I checked my audible stats and saw I had read/listened less in November than since I started the habit. 

What really hit me was my lack of interest in yoga. I had been practicing 3 hours a day. I had almost completely stopped in the last two months. I’d start for about ten minutes and lose interest and energy. I was depressed.

I decided to pull myself out of it and make myself dinner. I was excited at first, but by the time I finished cooking, I didn’t feel like eating and it tasted bland. I gave the food to my dog.

I feel like im in one of those jungle traps- the big holes in the ground. I can look up and see life all around me but I don’t have the energy to stand and pull myself up. I know it’s all in my mind and all I have to do is stand.


So today, I’ll try to stand."
depression,"so the conclusion? i'm not depressed, not sad, not happy- i can't say how I'm.. but i wanna be at least happy for once in a day- idk why i can't forget about my past - it still haunt me. sometimes i think It's all my fault- then i start to cry- is healing too much hard?"

depression,"My depression is worse than ever since my ex betrayed my trust and threw away my love I've been depressed now for 12 years and it's been bad, but never this bad. My ex made me happy for the first time in my life. I felt like I had a purpose and that was to care for her and love her. At the time it felt like she was the one I was going to grow old with.

She cheated on me, lied to me, lied to mutual friends, and turned everyone against me. Since then I've never been more lonely and isolated. I lost our shared flat, I sold my car for her, I had to move back to my family home. She even went so far as to falsely accuse me of harassment to the police but that was thrown out instantly.

Everything just keeps going wrong for me and I'm too tired to fight anymore. Self harm worked for a bit but now I only ever just feel so worthless and empty. I can't be loved and I deserved all the bad things that happen to me.

I'd give my life for just one more day of happiness but right now I just can't even imagine me ever being happy again."
depression,"I have it. I have depression right now and I totally get why some of the depressed people killed themselves. I was one of the dudes who say ""just pull yourself together"", I could have never been wrong in my entire life.  If anyone wonders what it felt like to have one, it is dark but not black, floating but not flying, loneliness but not sadness, and surviving but not living. It is weird, the lack of a goal, motivation, and desire to live is slowly taking its toll on our mental states. It is like quicksand on a beautiful beach you never know it was there until you come across it, and after you know that there is a quicksand on that beach, the way you look at that beach will never be the same. Our greatest enemy is ourselves, if this can't stop us, who else can? Stay strong warriors, do not give in!"
depression,"Everything is fucked and I just want to be hit by a truck. I'm in a really bad place and don't know what to do. Im at a point where I feel like there's only one way out. I'm always tired and exhausted both physically and mentally. My little sister has just dropped out of college due to her mental health and I'm scared for her. My Depression and anxiety has had a really bad effect on my course and I think I'm going to be kicked out of university. I have missed all my lectures except 2 or 3. I'm currently on my second half of Year 1 part time but couldn't renroll online as I swapped from full time to part time and it only had the option for year 2. So I had to email the university admin to manually enroll me. This has caused a lot of issues for me and I havnt had access to online course content, teams and stuff including the university app for timetabling. I missed an in course assessment as my online accounts didn't have permission to access the content. 

I have been emailing different people for a month or so trying to get these issues resolved but due to my low attendence I have now received an email saying ""Student record is DRE following not completing online registration for academic year. Student required to provide evidence of engagement before this can be looked into. Lecturer has confirmed student has not been attending his classes"".

I'm not sure what to do now. My mental health has gotten really bad recently and I'm struggling. There's a lot going on and I'm panicking. Due to having to take care of my grandmother after a heartattack I went part time last year so I could care for her. The module I'm currently doing I also did last year but I went part time just before the exam. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just tired of waking up everyday. My depression is so bad I don't really leave the house anymore and don't eat or drink unless I have to. I'm alway anxious and struggle to go and have missed many lectures. I'm a mess and lost on what to do next."

depression,"I hope that my alcoholic father would die I didn't pray to god much in my 21 years of life but if I had to start now I would pray for my father's death. He's an alcoholic and mentally abusive father, practically I only know his drunk side, I could count the times when he was sober on my fingers, since I was little he always picked fights with me or my mother for a stupid reason or another. When he got angry I didn't react because I was afraid, one time we had to sleep at relatives' house because he had threatened me and my mother with death threats, but now I'm 21 years old and can't take it anymore, recently he got in a fight with my mother because she didn't give him enough money to buy alcohol since we're low on money and this time I stood up and confronted him, I told him to shut the fuck up and go away. 
Now he left his job and he's unemployed, he came to me asking to find him a new job. He's fucking 50 and knows shit. 
I also have a 11 year old sister which is starting to get affected by my father and I don't want her to end up like me because of him. 
I'm depressed for a number of other reasons and when I come home form university I have to deal with my father, basically I can't concentrate on anything, I'm losing interest in what I previously enjoyed, I'm this close to leaving my last year of university to find a job to overwork myself and go the fuck away from my father and this life, starting from scratch in a new city or a new country, Canada would be my dream country but since I'm an european citizen it's not that easy.

depression,"I need help, bad. I wanna kill myself every day but I really want to fix myself. Firstly, thanks for taking the time to read my long ass post. I wrote a lot here.

I'm male, 15, sophomore. I'm a musician. I live for music. I've managed to split this into two categories

Problem 1; school.
I'm taking multiple honors and AP classes and I'm left with 0 free time even though I'm only completing like 1/4 of my work each night. I have unbelievably broken study habits. I can't pay attention in class at all and when I come home it takes me until like 9:00 to finally sit down and try to do my homework, which I then realize I don't know how to do because I wasn't paying attention in class. I'm current time and time to remind myself of the consequences and rewards of me doing my homework but I still just can't sit down and focus and get stuff done. Dropping harder classes is not an option, my parents would not let me. And I understand why, I know I'm capable of doing this work I just can't actually sit down and get done.

Problem 2; social.
My social skills are incredibly broken. I cannot talk to strangers at all, even my own best friends. I overthink everything and I'm just a boring person to talk to. This past week I've realized that literally all of my best friends are only friends with me because they are friends with my one true friend (let's just call him Greg) who I'm always with and I've known for years. Right after I started distancing myself from Greg for unrelated reasons, none of them even try to talk to me at all. Greg was my one link to them. I guess they only talk to me just cuz I was always around with Greg. Really hurts. I can't talk to strangers at all, I'm just so awkward in conversations. Even when talking to fellow musicians, I just come off as super annoying because I hyperactively talk about music gear and stuff.

Problem 3; myself
This one's really minor, it doesn't really contribute to the bigger picture for me but it would be nice to kind of get it out of the way. I'm straight up ugly, like solid 5/10. I don't need all that ""everyone is beautiful"" bullshit, I'd rather just come up with a way to not care about it. I'm in super bad shape. I've basically been living off of instant ramen noodles and frozen foods and shit for the past 3 years. I have started exercising which will hopefully improve things a bit. (Not really exercising because I hate my body, but because I'm trying to condition for playing marching tender drums which are super heavy). Also my teeth are really bad. Like I don't have any cavities or anything but they're just super crooked and yellow and I really hate it.

So all in all (tldr I guess) All my friends are fake and I can't get any of my work done. As a result I hate myself for who I am and it's worsening the already existing problems. I guess I should mention this, these problems have always existed, and have just been amplified 10 times worse as my mental health deteriorated.

I tried to shoot myself 1 time, put the gun to my head and all. Only stopped because I could hear my grandfather (who owns the pistol) walking back to the room and I also kind of felt bad for my family who would have to witness it and stuff. I really just want to wake up one day and not exist anymore. I don't want a painful but that seems like I'm running out of options and I might just have to hang myself if I can't find anything else. (Which by the way, if you don't know what you can help me, at least give me away I can painlessly go, thanks.) 

Hiring a therapist is not an option. Nor is talking to my family or friends about it. I cannot stand the idea of anyone else knowing about these problems. I guarantee you, all the attention and stuff it would bring would just be way too much for me and would probably make me want to die more. I'd really prefer to just do my best to fix things myself and have nobody ever know. 

I didn't proofread this so sorry if some of this doesn't make any sense."
depression,"I've tried so many different medications and none of them have helped. Am I a lost cause? \- Zoloft: Extreme foggy headedness, completely crippled my life for the fucking DECADE I took it. I had zero motivation to do anything and accomplished nothing as a result. Slept 12+ hours every day.

\- Prozac: HELLISH panic attacks, worst I've ever felt in my life. 

\- Wellbutrin: Current medication. I can think about literally nothing except killing myself. Have devolved to the point where I'm crying in public. 

\- Lamictal: Current medication. Does absolutely nothing as far as I can tell but I'm scared to go off of it in case I'm even worse without it.

\- Lexapro: Identical to Zoloft except I also gained about 40 pounds.

I'm so fucking desperate at this point. I have somewhat more motivation to do things on Wellbutrin but I cannot control my emotions at all. Does anyone have any advice?"
depression,"Purpose in life? We bought a house last year because we thought living in a house would be better for our son, not in a small apartment.

But he passed away.


So quiet in the house. We have no one to look after.


On top of that, there were so many upsetting crazy things happened to us, it’s just so unfair. Life is so unfair. They don’t care about our son died. They don’t care that they hurt our feelings or not. They are so evil. They will never understand what it’s like to lose your own child.


We lost our son. And a lot of money.


If you’re angry, sad, upset, frustrated, and depressed, what would you do? What should I do? Why am I still alive? What is the purpose of my life? What am I doing here?


I don’t know why we have to go through these so stupid stuff.


Is there anyone who is suffering from depression? Would you share your story?"
depression,"Still lost. Not really sure what to do anymore. I just turned 30 a couple of days ago. Stuck in a job I absolutely hate and everyday I look up the procedure how to leave. Honestly, it pays well (nothing over-the-top) and it's pretty easy. I just have to put up with not leaving my seat except for 15 minute breaks/an hour long lunch, and customers screaming at me for 10 hours a day. I should be grateful I get to have a job during all this crazy around us (my country's still not really recovered from covid). 

But I cant seem to imagine myself doing this longer, or even after I leave my job, I have no idea what I will or CAN do with my life. I've been worried about what I should/have to do since I was young, around 16. Here I am, 30 years old, still stuck and not really sure where to go from here.

Is this really what life has in store for me? Is this really all I can do? It sure seems like it. I'm not happy, the thought of what the future has in store for me frightens me, because I can't see it. So what's the point in clinging to hope that it'll be better?

Man, trying to ""live"" makes ""dying"" sound a whole lot easier."
depression,"Alcohol has taken my emotions away I’ve been drinking every day since September 11th (turned 18 which in my country is the legal age for drinking), I used to get pretty drunk from 250ml of a 15% cocktail, but now I need 1 liter of the same thing to get drunk. On days when I don’t get it I just feel different, like nothing, also I’m pretty irritated and just over all in a bad mood. Ive started to question the existence of me and everything around me, feels like this is just a dream in my head, an illusion. I stopped seeing bugs for like 2 months but now they are back, it’s annoying because the take my attention away from other stuff. I just feel like void, a shell of a person. I don’t wanna drink right now because I’m hungover and nauseous. I hate taking my meds (antipsychotics), I feel like they block me from discovering reality, they take my powers away. I’m a shell of a person"

I'm tired of crying and feeling alone everywhere I go. I'm tired of putting on a fake smile, I'm tired of lying and saying I'm ok when I'm not. I'm tired of getting nowhere in life when everyone else has loving caring family's. My soul is so sad and tired I dont want to do this anymore"

Guess I just switched over to mania.

depression,"He’s gone. And now I’m alone Ok I hate sounding cheesy or just being an annoying idiot but I don’t have anywhere else to turn to ( so thx reddit ). 

I miss him. He was such a good person. I miss the way we used to talk, I miss the cute texts, I miss that feeling where I knew we were both smiling at the same time, I miss making fun of u and ur weird fetish’s, I miss telling u everything and u comforting the dysphoria and loneliness bc u understood what it felt like. I wish things worked out different. I wish I was a bit stronger and didn’t end up in hospital. I wish he didn’t kill himself. There is so much that I want to change but I can’t now. He had his issues and a bad family - he said I was his family. And I wasn’t there for him. So I’ll spend the rest of my life missing him and wishing he was still w me."
depression,"I love the people in my life but I hate my life I wouldn’t say I have everybody that I need in my life… still feels like I’m missing connection. I feel a deep loneliness but I do love the people I have. My life just feels so unimportant and meaningless. In the sense that I do not feel as though I do anything meaningful or feel fulfilled by hobbies/career/relationships. But I have such an intense yearning for that feeling. It’s what keeps me away from suicide. My desire to live a full life. I just have no idea how to get it. I used to be creative as a child and I feel like it was beat out of me. No idea how to get it back. I fear I’m doomed without it.

depression,"Somethings I can’t forget. In this year alone I have been dumped, developed a disease, and lost my father to M.S. Losing my girlfriend is what really pushed me off the rails. It happened on January 1st, and I still can’t get over her.  I thought I would be okay after a few months but nothing feels the same. I had to stop working because of a problem I’m having neurologically.  Doing nothing all the time made me sad.  Knowing each day was going to be the same.. about a month ago my father died.  I still haven’t processed it.  I have dreams where he is there, walking like he used to. (Paralyzed from M.S since I was a child). I just don’t know where I am right now in my life. I’m 18 and have already dealt with more than most adults I know. Its not fucking fair. And I don’t have the guts to pull the trigger so I just sit on my ass and drink myself to death everyday.  There is nothing here that holds meaning."

i have been in love with her since july 2020 and its just gotten stronger since then. we did start dating on december 29th 2020 and i will never ever forget that. but i have a tendency to push people away as a form of sh. and thats exactly what i did. at the end of may/beginning of june i broke up with her for no reason. i pushed her away. i did this because i planned to kill myself the next day, and when the time came to kill myself i couldnt do it. i then went back to her after breaking up with her and asked if we could still be friends. and she said yes. we have been friends since then and i keep doing the same thing of trying to push her away but i never go through with it. i dont know why i do it. i find the smallest discrepancy that doesnt mean anything in the slightest bit and expand it into an issue and villainize her to turn her into a bad person so its easier for me to push her away. im still so in love with her it hurts me, and somedays i honestly contemplate just killing myself. my family doesnt like me very much and often ignores my existence. i want to be happy. i dont know whats wrong with me. please help me."
depression,"Any advice on how to cope with periods of no interest in anything? When nothing seems to make you happy and everything feels boring? I slip into periods of depression every couple of weeks. It’s not really triggered by anything, just a regularly scheduled thing in my brain. The symptoms and the way I feel can vary, but I most often know immediately that I’m slipping into it when I start having those days where I have absolutely no desire to do anything. Nothing holds my interest and I find myself just sitting in bed and feeling unsatisfied, trying to get my mind off of it a couple different ways but not being able to shake that “bored” feeling. When I’m in a healthier mindset, it’s easy for me to find things to do in my free time that excite me, but when I’m in these episodes I just can’t find the desire at all. 

I know it’s not the most serious issue, but it does make me feel pretty miserable sometimes when the feeling of boredom and emptiness lasts for days, or weeks. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and has a method or practice for dealing with it?"

depression,"What do you feel ? My therapist asked me to explain what I feel. The next words she said was “ well you explained depression and anxiety perfectly.” I kinda felt like my feelings were validated for the first time in such a long time.

But anyways What do you feel?"
depression,"I wanted to live but not with this life. I want to kill myself because I'm sick with my toxic family members (especially my cousin and uncle), fake friends, and don't-give-a-fuck-about-me parents. I'm suicidal, and I despise everyone in my life.

My teacher favors certain students and engages in gossip with my female classmates. One day, I overheard my teacher talking with my other female classmates about how difficult I am to work with and have a lot of insecurities.  I also hate my ex-best friend who has an angelic face and acts like a saint but is a total two-faced person for backstabbing me (She date the man I fell in love with). My parents, who tell me that I'm not depressed, and I should act normal. My girl cousin, who spread fake bad rumors about me in Highschool and always destroy my self-esteem at family gatherings. My brothers, who wish I wasn't their sister because I'm too boring for them. 

You're all the reason I've stopped opening up because you're all ruining me. You're the reason I've become distant, gloomy, or moody and locked myself up in my room.

Then one day, I decided to confide with my mother. Instead of providing me with good advice, she compares me to my cousins and the children of our neighbors instead. Then tell me to not carry grudges against any of our family members, and what they say is true and beneficial to my development as a person (Like wtf), she told me to stop being sensitive and live my life normally. During that time, I couldn't take it any longer, telling her that her family is toxic. 

Right now, there is still a part of me that wants to keep living. But half of me wished to break free and disappear from this world since I could only see how miserable I am as each day passed. 

 PS: Sorry for the grammar mistakes."

depression,"I'm Trying Hard To Be Compassionate To Myself But I Just Feel Useless I'm currently trying to apply for disability because I have  Borderline Personality Disorder, ADHD, Schizoaffective Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and of course those come with Major Depression and PTSD. I've been in therapy for about 2.5 years and I have a great therapist, and like, logically I know that my mental illness is not my fault. My symptoms are not my fault. But it still somehow doesn't stop me from feeling useless because I can't work.

I think part of it is feeling so much pressure because of having no income. The waiting period for disability is such a pain, they make it really hard to fight and I know people say that process is normal. In the meantime I get a small amount of like supplemental income but it's literally barely enough to cover basic needs. And not including food because I'm lucky enough to have EBT. 

I've tried considering looking into other sources that wouldn't disrupt my disability, like selling artwork/crafts or I've even considered sex work since there's just so many different forms of it now. But literally my symptoms just don't make any of those workable. Things like hyperfixation, inability to self regulate, not being able to stay consistent, social anxiety, not able to be personable enough to sell myself as a person as a product. I just. I'm so frustrated. I feel lonely. I feel isolated. I feel absolutely useless because I feel like I can't contribute anything to my relationship. Which I KNOW is so ridiculous because we are both disabled. And like, I literally would never feel this way towards my fiance. Yet. Here I am. Feeling crappy.

depression,"How can I help my friend? TW for self harm and suicide Hello everyone!
I wanted to ask how I can help my friend. She's struggling with depression and she's suicidal. She goes to therapy and takes antidepressants, but it's obvious she's struggling. 
Her mother is not helping at all. She's having her taking care of her younger siblings, blames her for not talkig to her, thinks she's just lazy, doesn't think she needs help and is just overall a shitty mother. 

Now especially, as this is the last year of high school and we have A LOT to do. We have a lot of work. The teachers know about her struggles and try to help her as much as they can, but they can't do more unless her mother steps in and actually starts taking care of her and stop putting more pressure on her home.

She has very high absence, but now it's especially high since her mother got COVID and the whole family is in quarantine and she's a very social person who needs friends.

I feel like I'm not doing anything to help, but anytime she wants to call and work with me in our separate projects I decline. I have anxiety and having people around makes me anxious, no matter how well I know them, which leads to me getting exhausted and having a mental breakdown (which happened earlier this year, when I would be all day in school and them talk all evening with my friend, with almost no time for myself).

I don't want to sacrifice my mental health to help her, but I feel like if I don't do anything, she's going to kill herself or go back to self harm as more and more pressure is put on us during the year in school and at home.

What should I do? I really want to help her, but I feel like I'm exhausted myself.

Also, social services are not a good idea since my friend is of legal age now and could move out. Not to mention, this would only made the whole situation worse and the mother would be mad at my friend. 

The only reason she can't move out is because she doesn't have a job and couldn't support herself."

Greatly helped my anxiety, but I had more symptoms of depression pop up. Mainly feelings of great sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness and guilt for no reason. Talked to my doctor a little over a month ago who diagnosed me with depression, and asked if I wanted to up my dose of sertraline, or try Bupropion. 

I went the route of trying Bupropion XL 150mg daily. It hasn’t really helped to be completely honest- in fact, some days I feel worse than before. I talked to my doctor yesterday about this, and my options are:

-Go up to 300mg or Bupropion daily
-Switch to a different medication

I like bupropion cause I’ve already lost about 10 lbs (gained about 35 on sertraline), but honestly it has not done anything for me. What do you guys think who have been down this route before? I’m honestly not sure what to do. If bupropion didn’t work at 150mg will it work at 300mg? Just looking for any advice.

It’s made planning for the future so difficult because I never know when I’m going to leave? I literally remember being asked in middle school what i wanted to be when i grew up and my only thought was “dead”?? For context I’ve always had a somewhat stable family and kind people in my life but it hasn’t deterred me from wanting to die. So far it has been one biggest constants in my life.

Just as soon as I think I figure it out, I tackle those problems head on, but the feeling remains the same. I don’t have any close friends, or anything like that. I believe it’s because I’m very awkward when I don’t know someone and it takes time for me to open up. I’m very bad at starting conversations, or joining new groups. I wish to work on that.

depression,"I am slipping I am 18m and I can't do it. How am I supposed to live? I am Christian and have gender identity issues. And I can't do anything about it. Gender reassignment is treated as sin and I would have to give up Holy Communion for it, which is basically death for your soul. And on the other side of the spectrum, I have suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

And let me ask you, WHAT IS THIS IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE? I am balancing between them, and I might slip one day. And let's discuss what those choices are:

1. If I do Gender Reassignment is basically telling God I know better than him, even tho I think all that happened to me is a consequence of sin in the world and I should be allowed to reduce some of the pain it causes me. But still, it's not up to me, it all depends on what those in power say ""What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven"".

2. I commit suicide and through that, I will throw out what God gave me and tell him I know better.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate this choice so much. And even if I went with the first option as a better counterpart to the second, what then? I won't be able to have any children, I will never be fully a woman both psychologically and physically. I will never be attracted to men the way women are. And living without Holy Communion is not living at all, just allowing Devil to do whatever he wants with you. 

And then suicide... I don't think I am even capable of doing it, it sounds painful and there is a possibility of brain damage.

&amp;#x200B;

And there is my family, I have social anxiety and it basically eliminates option one, I wouldn't be able to survive telling them psychologically. You could say that I can work on my anxiety but I am at least two years away from therapy, so that's that.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand their reasoning for forbidding this, it does make a lot of sense. But they are forgetting the most important, we are hurting. We have all been redeemed by Jesus Christ and yet I am left with this broken choice because they can't know what we feel until they experience that themselves. It basically comes to that.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at my lowest. Yesterday I looked up suicide methods and boy was that a journey, who knew so much risk is involved of brain damage. What a way to stifle the urge."

depression,"My doctor is weaning me off So, I found out that in pregnant this week and my doc actually suggested weaning me off my setraline because it was making me so numb and unmotivated. 

I got on it about 7 weeks ago because I have been super depressed since June. He thinks there is a possibility that I came out of my depression on my own and then the setraline in my system was dampening all my emotions. I don't know if this is possible and if he really knows what he is talking about. Obviously he is a Dr. And I want to trust him, but it's my PCP, not a psychologist. 

I think it's possible that the fish oil and beef liver (fat soluble Vitamin A) I was taking daily for months possibly built up in my system and was making me depressed. The daylight is getting less here now, and I've been using light therapy each morning to also possibly counter any bout of seasonal affective disorder that may occur. 

My god. I hope I don't go back to being depressed. We shall see! It would be amazing to want to do things again and be excited and motivated. 

Just posting my experience and I hope to update because I know I was so confused about if I needed the SSRI still or if it was actually making things worse at a certain point. So, if it's possible to be happy and yourself after being on an SSRI for a bit, I want to let people know. Because maybe what you need is to wean off, rather than adding more medications and take a look at what's in your vitamin stack that could ironically be making you depressed? 

It's too early to tell obviously, but hopefully 5 weeks from now I'm back to my old self and I can come on here and say that in my case, the medication made my depression bearable, but in the end my brain repaired itself or whatever was causing the depression had been eliminated long enough (vitamins, ect), that now the SSRI was actually not allowing my brain to function normally."

I hate how I look, I hate how I am, I hate who I am, I hate that I don’t have the willpower to change anything about me, I hate that I know I will never change anything about me. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what I want anymore. Am I lonely? If I get a GF will I finally be able to remember how it is to be happy? Is this just a phase/episode? A few years from now, will I be able to look back at this and laugh at myself for being like this? I don’t know anymore. I can’t even play games anymore because I can’t even get the energy to play something. I can’t even sleep. I just cry until I’m too tired to keep my eyes open. I don’t even know if I want to feel happy anymore. Feeling sad just feels normal now. Why am I like this? Why don’t I even have the will to change it?"
depression,"Just need to get it out Hey, I'm sorry if this breaks any rules. 

31 male, been diagnosed with a mild case of depression since I was 16 or so. Saw a few therapists over the years, two were absolutely fantastic and I loved going to my appointments,  the other sucked.  Haven't gone since my last good one went on leave and I never got a call back. That was a few years ago now. Days like this, I miss it. Days like this I miss anti-depressants. It's been a while since I've felt this bad. The feeling of wanting to drive into traffic on my way to work.  The feeling of needing/wanting to cry, but there's just nothing there. I want to he held, but my fiancée is at work, but I also don't want to be touched. Suicide is bad, cutting is bad. I've been clean for a few years now (four I think, ) but I still get that urge. It won't fcking go away. I could never kill myself. Whenever I get that thought my daughter pops into my head asking where I'm at and when she'll see me and I feel even worse for having those thoughts. She's a great deterrent,  but it's a vicious cycle. 

I'd like to start going for walks or something.  To get out of the house,  maybe after work in the am. Oh yea, winter time backshift frigging sucks. I always felt that exercise at work should be enough that I shouldn't have to do more at home, I just wanna hang out with the future wife until I have to leave.  Play cards, do a puzzle, cuddle on the couch, whatever. Not... Walk. Then this happens and I realize that exercise at work probably doesn't affect you the same as exercise outside of work.  Maybe it's a mental thing, or maybe it's just not enough.  Who knows. 

I think my best bet would be to get her to be more forceful at getting me out of the house. I just hate being outside even though 9/10, I admit that it feels good. I just don't know. I should probably try anti-depressants again, but I'm just not a fan. I also don't want to go to therapy again because after finding two good ones only to have something happen is disheartening, let's not even mention the shortage. What else is there that I can do? Is my best bet to try and get off my ass and get outside? 

Oh! I also take a multi vitamin + extra Vitamin D3 because I assume the 2 a day it recommends is for normal people who get sunlight, not someone who sleeps during the day and is essentially a vampire. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. I'm gonna sleep now."
depression,"How could bullying destroy me so much? When I was a child, at school they insulted me, they beat me between several classmates several times, and they attacked me. They came to piss in my parents' car, and to throw stones at the windows of my house. I never asked to change schools, I did not want to give anyone that satisfaction. I spent my school years almost without friends, and of constant abuse and daily attack, which of course the teachers knew about and did nothing to avoid. As long as they weren't against them, the troubled kids could keep fucking the weakling of the class.

Now I am 34 years old. I have no capacity to relate socially with anyone. I have constant fear, anxiety, depression.

I feel very bad almost in a generalized way.

So they destroyed me. I have grown up being a broken person. I have no arrangement.

Sometimes I think that if I had been in another school, or another situation, my life would be different.

I wouldn't have to medicate for just about anything that gets on my nerves. I would have friends, Iwould have a family of my own.

Imight even have been happy.

Today I just wait for the time to stop working so I can take the pill that makes me disconnect for a while from ""my reality"", and hopefully, never wake up again"
depression,"Less intense emotions Does anyone else have this? It's like, I do feel something and act upon it but emotions don't feel normal anymore, like they're diluted or something.

honestly all I really want is to be able to remember things properly and think decently enough

depression,"need someone to tell me i am not alone i have dealt with anxiety and depression for quite a while, haven’t been formally diagnosed as I can’t bring myself to call or see a doctor. I would say i experience depression all year but especially bad during the winter months. The seasonal depression has hit me like a brick wall this year, way harder than usual. I have been feeling intense sadness, hopelessness, etc. From the moment I wake up my eyes are welled with tears and I truly feel like I cannot get out of bed. Even if I do get out of bed I cry brushing my teeth, getting dressed, driving to work, etc. And no my depression isn’t just crying I have many many others symptoms including suicidal thoughts. I would say up until recently I would have considered myself high functioning, no matter how hard it got I could still force myself to go to work and do my job. But this year I have hit rock bottom and on top of that have been experiencing some workplace issues that have caused my anxiety and hopelessness to spiral. Today I had to call in because I truly could not leave my bed or my house. I am just so tired. I know I need to get help as I can’t keep going on like this but it’s so hard for me to bring myself to do anything."
depression,"Self awareness just made me more depressed. The last year I have done so much introspection and I have overanalyze the meaning of life and how worthless really is that it only made me more depressed. I have done  so many sad realizations and I have discover so many bitter truths that it's impossible to go back anymore. It's not about me and my own problems anymore. I wish it was. Is the way that society and people work and how I should also work in order to survive and I don't want it.

Having all the self awareness of who I'm, my mistakes, why I feel this way, what happened to me and why people be the way they are didn't help to improve my life and feel better on the contrary it made me feel more alone and depressed than before. Because in real I can't find people who want to talk about these stuff. Everyday I read so many comments on social media and most people seem to only care about superficial stuff, nobody takes responsibility for their actions, they find intellectualization boring and stupid and they don't have a clue about all the mental health struggles.

I feel completely out of reality. I'm not able to connect with anyone anymore and at the same time I feel that I can't see so clearly the world around me, the rislity without excuses and this crushing me down.

It may sounds like I think I'm better than others. Well I don't really know if I'm and I don't really care. What I know is that I would want a lot to just be ignorant and not seeing what exactly happens. To not be able to observe and analyze people.

Im tired hearing about the chemical imbalance in my head? What imbalance? I don't feel depressed because I have lived horrible situations. This is the least of my problems. I feel depressed because I see how unfair the world is, how meaningless and how everything based on pure lack despite that they try to convince us about free will. Maybe I'm too sensitive but how to be happy in a world where the most manipulative and unempanthetic people are always the most popular while some others will always be the victims? When some people always feel guilty for small stuff while others never own their shits? When you see people abuse animals without reason just for fun?

And I'm not a good person, it's not that I help I'm just stupid enough to always feel responsible about everything, to be afraid to not hurt anyone and end up hurt myself and be here wondering if I'm good person or not just for the fact that I'm judgmental of others in my head."

depression,"""I've made it"" and I've never felt more lost.  Hi all,

I don't want to bore anyone, so I'll try to be as brief as I can.

I'm 30, a bit of an introvert and I've been depressed for the most part of my life.

I did not have a great childhood and spent half of my life working jobs I dislike. I was overworked, constantly tired and bitter. I convinced myself that the rat race is killing me and I would never be truly happy if I continue living like this, so I decided to try and make a change. I got into investing and spent the last couple of years investing everything I got. A few months ago I got lucky with my investments (I say lucky, beacause realize that this is glorified gambling) and I was able to leave the race that I thought was slowly killing me. I no longer have to work and I have all my time to myself.

Well, things did not turn the way I thought they would. I'm bored out of my mind, and more confused about my future and life in general then ever before.

The shitty jobs I had kept me preoccupied and made me cherish the little free time I had. I felt that there are a lot of great things for me to do and things that I could improve if I only had the time. Since I was constantly tired I also never had to deal with all the crap that was subconciously bothering me.

And now, I'm alone with myself for 17 hours a day, and man it's not fun. Nothing excites me, everything feels pointless and I feel that I'm wasting my life away. I got myself all the material garbage that I couldn't afford before and I couldn't care less about it. Every hobbie or activity I try keeps me engaged for a few days and then I completely lose interest.

I feel like I'm living in a constant existential crisis.

The most positive thing about my situation is that I can finally afford therapy and I've been doing that for a couple of months. We're primarily working on my childhood trauma and I realise how important that is. I'm also trying to be healthier and I can feel the benefits of doing both things. However, I feel that there is still something missing. I'm not convinced that coming to terms with my childhood and losing the few kilos I gained during the pandemic will help me feel more fulfilled and excited about life.

To be completely honest, I'm not sure what I expect to get from this post, but any suggestions, ideas and oppinions are welcome.

P.S. I also realise that this is a very first world problem to have and although I'm not particularly happy, I'm grateful for how things are."
depression,"how do i tell my mum i’m struggling with my mental health tw - self harm

so i was really ill for a few years (from age 11-14), now i’m 16 and i’m just getting back into education and the stress is really having a detrimental effect on my mental health already. i’m already behind on my coursework. i have a powerpoint due in 2 minutes ago &amp; i’m no where near done. i’m torn behind just leaving it versus handing it in late. i’m trying really hard but it’s like i just can’t motivate myself. i done really well the first few weeks. i’m good at the subjects i’m in. and now this. 

the past few days, honestly, i’ve felt myself fall into depression again. i’ve been depressed before but things had got a lot better for a while, it seems like academic stress is what sets me off. it seems like it’s gone from 0-100 when it comes to depression. i’ve already started cutting my thighs to an extreme degree, worse than i’ve ever done it before. i don’t want to tell my mum, i’ll be humiliated. but i’m falling behind on my coursework and i feel like it’s the right thing to do so at least my teachers will know where i’m genuinely struggling (most of my teacher are very nice and would be understanding about this, ik this isn’t the case for everyone). my mum has mental health issues herself so ik she’ll be understanding but when i first got depressed at 11, she found out i was self harming &amp; just got really mad at me lol. she’s dealt with her issues (or she’s dealing with them at least), she’s a lot more open then she use to be &amp; i know she’ll be okay about but i’m still scared for some reason. how do i approach this?"
depression,"Can’t lean on anyone because everyone has their own lives to worry about I’m such a fat burden on everyone around me and I rely too much on others. I know I worry those who care about me and I know that everyone else has their own problems too. I’m too weak to help myself but it’s just unfair to lean on others who have to take care of themselves too. I just hurt everyone around me even if it’s in the most subtle way. I know I’m fucking annoying and draining to be around. I just want to stop existing. I wish my existence was never real. Every day is such a fucking drag and I’m so tired of being this way. It hasn’t gotten better no matter what I’ve done. If it weren’t for my parents, I would’ve already killed myself. It’s so painful texting or calling my mom and her being under the impression that I’m successful and happy when I’m just crying alone, failing school, and developing an alcohol addiction. I just can’t continue on like this. What is the point of living if this is how things will be. Although me being gone might upset people at first, soon after the burden I impose on others will be gone and all my friends and coworkers and advisors and literally anyone else I interact with regularly will be relieved of the pain I’m always inflicting upon them. Nobody truly wants me around, I know that for certain. Nobody understands how I feel either, which makes me feel like I’m just crazy and that I’m a tumor everyone is waiting to be removed. I just want to die so badly, I don’t know how else to stop the pain."
depression,"I don’t feel deserving of what I have. Im 27, and i’ve been battling depression for the past 9yrs. It hasn’t been easy, and there’s good and bad days. Recently though i’ve been having a ton of great days, because I met the most wonderful girl who is beautiful beyond words, and is the greatest thing that’s happened to me. The problem is that when I get depressed, I tell her all the time that she deserves better than me. She always denies it, and says she doesn’t want anybody else. I have to remind myself constantly that if she wanted somebody else, she would have somebody else. I’ve already self sabotaged a past relationship because I doubted myself, and now im terrified to go down the same path as before. I finally found a girl that sits by my side and helps me fight my worst fears, and all I can think about is how one day im gonna ruin this.

depression,"Tried to make a new start for myself, ended up back here I tried to become a new person, I moved to a different school and I even picked up a new hobby which is playing guitar. I did fine on my first week of school, I was able to complete my tasks on time. Didn't make any friends cause of how our school works. We are just given modules to take home and we answer them and pass the stuff at the end of the week. No face to face classes, no online classes, I have never even seen my classmate's faces. I just ignored that bit, I was happy I didn't have to interact with people much cause it means I wouldn't fuck up in front of them or be a disappointment. I was making progress learning guitar, and it was even fun actually. I actually did something that didn't involve staring at a screen for once.

But then there came a day where I wasn't able to keep up with my school work. This is where things went wrong. It messed up my whole rhythm with keeping up on things and soon I was flooded with activities I had to complete. Now I keep lying to my mom about how I'm definitely managing things just fine. When I go to my doctor I try to be honest. I say that I feel like I'm just forced to be alive and that I feel like my life is going nowhere. But for some reason I just feel like he doesn't get me. The only real change that happened when it comes to the doctor stuff is that my dosage got increased but I don't really feel much of a difference.

I went through all that and yet I'm still back here. I knew that all of this was just a way to distract myself from my inevitable future where I end up with an unfulfilling life and eventually die alone."
depression,"depressed in a toxic relationship Although I’m not technically alone, being in this toxic, codependent relationship makes me feel so incredibly lonely. I’ve lost all my close friends and distanced my family members. Everyone asks me why I’ve become like “this”. Why I continue stick around this person when I clearly want to leave. Sometimes I look at my life and mourn who I could have become had I never met this person, and naively agreed to everything they said. 

Each day I feel more stuck, and I don’t even know how to get out anymore. My depression is getting worse and worse, I have suicidal thoughts that I can’t tell anyone about. I wake up in the middle of the night from anxiety fueled nightmares, and each day passes just like the one before it. I feel like I can’t remember things, like there is a thick fog over my brain.

This was the first time that I felt understood and that I took care of my mental health.

I know she cut me out because she probably can’t deal with my emotional baggage anymore. I never tried to dump it on her. I was there for her at her worst, so i think that’s why it hurts so much.

It's mostly guys though, I sometimes see guys I think are hot so I would say hi or even flirt with them but they say mean shit like ""why the fuck are you talking to me?"" ""Who the fuck are you?"" And tell me to leave them alone. I have an outgoing personality so I naturally greet everyone I see. As soon as people see me, most times, their face instantly goes from happy/neutral to annoyed, people look straight past me and ignore me, snap at me for asking them a random question but I realize most people don't get the same treatment.

Countless people tell me I'm beautiful, stunning, gorgeous, pretty, hot and cute but I still get this shitty treatment from people I don't even know and I don't get male attention.

depression,"Ruining college life, not sure what to do Just a quick history: (I'm sorry if it's seems super vague)

I don't think I ever was good at school or liked it, so I think if I ever got any good grades in school it was because I was scared of how my parents would react if I did badly. 

I also picked my first major in college based on that same logic of ""making my parents proud"", and as a result really screwed over my GPA after having multiple breakdowns. 

I thought switching my major would help (I picked something I could ""tolerate""), but I'm finding myself in the same place again as the start of college. At the start of switching my major, I also found out one parent was cheating on another, so I had another mental breakdown that semester. It's been getting better thought and I try not to think about it (it's complicated). 
I feel very apathetic, tired, and want to give up. It's really hard to even brush my teeth or do basic hygiene without the motivation of having to see someone. I don't really feel like I have anything to look forward to in life (not that I want to end myself). I just feel... numb? I used to be good at holding up a facade since grade school (where I also had a very long depressive episode in 3rd and 4th grade and also throughout highschool), but now I'm getting worse at it.
It's weird cuz in highschool I could really pull through (to the point that I even went to class one year and wrote tests after having surgery a few days prior), but in college I just have nothing. I'm also behind in classes (not just because of switching) but because I drop them cuz I just can't register anything in my head. I'm getting more scared cuz my parents expect me to graduate ""on time"" but I'm scared to tell them how I feel (they had a really hard life so I feel me complaining is really gonna trigger them). I'm scared to get help cuz I feel like I'm just being pathetic and should just pull through but I feel paralyzed. 
I'm not quite sure what to do at this point in my life (no goals, nothing to look forward to, etc.). If anyone's ever dealt with this, any advice? Thank you"
depression,"Just a rant I haven’t been diagnosed so I don’t know whether I really have depression or not. I can’t ask my parents because they are the kind who think depression is an excuse to be lazy and useless. For the past few weeks/months I’ve been feeling like my life is absolutely hopeless and that there’s no point living. I don’t care about anything, all I want to do is lie in my bed and look at my phone. I have a test coming up to determine which school I go to and according to many people, this test is rigged and you only end up in bad schools. I’m feeling extremely hopeless because those schools produce students who barely pass exams, even if I want to study hard at those schools, the Teachers and resources are terrible and all the students don’t care about school. My dad scolds me everyday for being useless and he says i will be kicked out of the house if I get into the bad schools. He always says that I should become a road sweeper. I’ve studied a fair bit for this test, but unfortunately I’ve asked many people and they only got into bad schools. I feel like suicide will be the best option since I never wanted to live anyway. I don’t even have any motivation to study now because I have given up entirely. My parents are fairly well off, so they think that there is no way I’m depressed because I have a ‘good life’. They don’t even know that calling me useless and lazy everyday makes me feel so bad. I feel like crying every single day because I am so useless and hopeless and I really didn’t want to be born to just be a useless worthless person. Without my cat I’d probably be dead by now. I want to try to do well but it’s really impossible and everything that goes wrong will be my fault. I don’t even know how to describe what I’m feeling, I want to be dead but I don’t want to kill myself. I think I will just kill myself if the test goes badly. I really want to stop feeling hopeless and depressed but it seems like my life is done and all I’m born to do is to be useless."
depression,"Does Clonidine Help You? I'm aware this is the depression sub, but, as these disorders often go hand-in-hand, and I don't really have the wherewithal to go sub-shopping right now, I figured I'd just go ahead and ask y'all about this.

As well as severe depression, I have severe anxiety with panic disorder.  Anything or nothing can set it off, and when I'm thrown down the panic attack spiral, like I am right now, I can feel extremely desperate.

I am currently not prescribed anything for my mental health conditions.  None of em.  I am between psychiatrists, and my GP refuses to prescribe me any psych meds.  I am, however on Clonidine (Catapres), for high blood pressure.  That's Clonidine, the blood pressure med, not to be confused with Klonopin, the benzodiazepine anxiety med.  It often makes me feel relaxed and sleepy when I take it, so I usually take it at night, but lately, I've started taking it in the morning, because I tend to be up all night and go to sleep in the early morning hours, anyway.  I'm wondering if it might help with my anxiety and panic attacks this morning.  I mean, I have to take it, either way, I'm just wondering if I can expect any sort of relief when it kicks in.  The panic I am experiencing right now is pretty intense, with hot face, cold hands and feet, icy burn under the skin, prickly and irritable feeling all over, super restless muscles (my husband and I call them ""eel muscles,"" because it feels like the muscles are wrapped around squirming electric eels ), and some pretty icky tummy symptoms, as well.  Feeling very miserable at the moment, really, really hoping for some relief, and soon.

Has clonidine ever helped you with anxiety?"
depression,"I (32 M) want a family/kids more then anything. My girlfriend (39 F) recently cut it off with me. I got super attached to her 8 years old son. And I never got to have the conversation about trying to get more active in his life.

And now that it’s too late I realize I want kids more than anything in the world. And that’s one of the main things from the break up that upsets me. I’ll never get to see him again.

She was my first ever. Unfortunately she broke up with be. We did not have sex. Because I go in my head.

depression,"Life doesn’t get better A year ago my view of the world was flipped upside down and this year has definitely been the worst year of my life, I tried doing self help by going to the gym consistently, meditation, and trying new things but it was all short lived.

depression,Finding life so pointless I been feeling like this for years now. I find there’s no point on living. All we do is struggle and work if you don’t have a lot of money. Nothing seems important. I’m starting to lose interest in my passion which is dancing but even that I think I’m not good enough to make it big. I’m not in college rn because I’m trying to figure things out but no career calls my attention. I don’t want to keep being here. I just want to know what’s after death. I wouldn’t try harming myself because I am extremely scared of pain so I just pray I die peacefully in my sleep. At the same time I don’t even feel sad I’m just annoyed and tired. Any Advice?
depression,"how to cope with eternal oblivion? i used to believe in god but i got exposed to gore videos. that made me think ""huh, what happens after we die."" that single thought made me think about death 24/7 literally,  icouldnt focus on school and i was just spacing out, i been thinking  of ending it but im too afraid to die, well technically im not afraid of death but im scared of what comes after death. i think its called eternal oblivion or something. Ive also lost all meaning in stuff i used to enjoy before like playing games or other stuff. it just feels blank and boring everything seems so gray now in my point of view, death been stuck on my mind and ive lost all meaning in life, u know death doesnt sound that bad anymore, it now makes me feel warm as im writing this. maybe when i die i will find true peace. or if anyone can help me please help me cope with this."

My sister is 13 and I am 27 (f) . She doesn’t like our mom and is very distant with everyone. We keep in contact over the phone ( currently live overseas, but I am moving back to my hometown this year) but it’s for plying games and nothing personal. 

She stopped going to school. My mom can’t seem to force her to go. It’s been two weeks now . My mom has tried to take her to therapy but she doesn’t talk to them stopped going, and my mom is fighting with insurance to try to get to to a psychologist instead, but still no signs . 

She is also transition on becoming a boy. Her clothes, hair cut, characters she takes on… but it wasn’t confirmed until my mom searched through her phone . A lot of her google searches are about being transgender and becoming a boy 
and some pages that suggest suicide. 
My mom just told me this . 

My mom and I completely welcome her choice and will do anything to make her feel comfortable. But she doesn’t open up at all. I don’t even know how to bring this up . I want to help her so bad and it pains me so much that she is even thinking about taking her life . I don’t know if it’s the right place to post this but I really need the advice .  

Thank you"
depression,"Doing absolutely nothing with my life I do nothing the whole day, and go to sleep as early as I can. I wake up in the morning knowing I'm just a financial burden to my family. No friends, no skills, no looks, no intelligence. I think some people are born to suffer and be an example of what not to be to others.

I got a diagnosis and got put on meds, have seen no effects so far. Maybe I'm beyond help and should just off myself already"
depression,"Had a dream I told my mom my anxiety was so bad, I just wanted to die. Woke up having those same feelings. 14 months ago I almost took my own life and it has been a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs since. I thought I moved past the  mornings of waking up with unannounced, no particular cause anxiety/depression.

It makes it so hard to even make it through the day. I’m so tired of having to take these feelings to the people in my life, I feel like such a heavy burden. But I also don’t know how to get through the feelings alone. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get through work today.

depression,"Climbing out of a hole I feel bad. I keep panicking getting frustrated again, procrastinating. I'm stuck in this house and can't go anywhere. I'm too scared to talk to people, I get frustrated with my mum when she talks for a long time, I acted in a way that made my friend go away. I should hopefully be driving again soon, I guess I should then try to get out more. 

But I am so scared of myself, what kind of person I am when I get frustrated so easily. Why am I so frustrated, am I scared, and I'm unhappy with myself and lack confidence. I don't even sound bad or nothing is wrong with me, I've got so much going for me. I keep comparing myself to others and thinking that I should be like that. 

Hey, come on buddy, you're pretty awesome, wipe the mud off your goggles. Stop digging your own hole. I wish someone would tell me that they liked the things about me that I don't. I should probably tell this to myself! Gawd dangit."

depression,"I’ve always been someone who looks too deep into things that I end up hurting that person and myself after being made human without the possibility of *BEING* a human kills me. The cruelest, most vile punishment of them all. My depression is so bad i think I might have to go back to the psych ward, after 2 years. I don’t want to but I just can't take it anymore. I want to leave my house rn and croak."
depression,"I hate my life. First, I have no intention on trolling or “flexing” on anybody here.

I have my fill of drugs and alcohol regularly to the point where they are common things in my life. I’m surrounded by women who want to have sex with me. I have great friends who I enjoy being around. I live in comfort daily for the most part. I’m on my way to getting a major in computer engineering. 

And yet, even all of these things combined are enough to stop the dull, numb feeling that I have at the end of the day. There is a void that cannot be filled with the pleasures of life. I have everything and yet nothing. Any happiness I would receive is immediately stolen out from between my grasp before I can experience it. I hate my life to the point where I would commit suicide because life isn’t worth living without happiness."

I’m not unique or special in anyway and I’ve always had trouble making friends, making connections; and not feeling alienated

depression,"Will it ever get better? I’m just fed up. So fed up. I feel like my youth is just being wasted away by illnesses and issues I can’t control, and it’s going to impact my future because of having to miss school and all that — it’s not fair.

I didn’t ask for any of this. I waste away all day, every day, in my bed, unable to enjoy or do ANYTHING. I’ve been on 2 different antidepressants so far, and nothing. I know it takes time, and i know i might need to experiment with more, but it’s so fucking hard. It takes so long and I don’t know how to deal with any more months of this crap. My kind of depression is the kind where I’m quite literally fucking immobile. I feel pathetic, and weak. I lose hope. It’s so hard to cope, there is so little good in my life.

I just want it to get better already. I don’t know why this is happening to me, why I can’t just get up, watch a movie and actually enjoy it, not feel like im on my deathbed for once. I just don’t even know what to do. If it was the kind of depression where i still had a life but with that emptiness, i could manage, but i just dont. I have nothing. I wake up, stay in bed, go back to sleep. Every single day. It never improves, ive tried so much. 

I feel like my entire life is just nothing. I have little future because of lack of education, i cannot even enjoy things and use those as the “little things” in life to keep me going. I want to live my life and be happy, i love the idea of life  but I have such an awful one. I just want it to get better. Everything feels so completely out of my control and i fail to believe this can change, i dont know how it could. It makes me miserable. I deserve a chance at being happy but i feel like i will simply never get one, and that breaks my heart."

But I just feel like total shit. I'm living with a host family who knows I am depressed. They told me to enjoying being here and leave my USA problems there because they will be there when I return. I'm so tired of saying I'm okay because I am not. I can't just put this aside, trust me if I could I would have a long time ago. I'm also battling an eating disorder which has gotten much worse since I've been here. I just want to go home but would be disappointed in myself for giving up the opportunity. I've tried to see a therapist here but none from the US can see me because of license issues and my study abroad coordinator says they have someone for me to see, but haven't responded.

depression,I’ve been having suicidal thoughts again. I’m just not sure how to talk to my loved ones about this. My last attempt was just a few months ago and I’m afraid I’ll disappoint everyone who helped me get out of that if I let them know I’ve slid right back into that same state of mind.

My meds are working every now and then, but it's not enough to really get me motivated to start schoolwork.

depression,"I hate myself and my brain. In advance, I apologise for having the writing skill of a 3 year old with a dull crayon.

All I ever wanted to do in life was join the military, no other career interested me. So when I graduated highschool back in 2019, I enlisted in the army, I’ve never been more proud of myself before then. Then when we only had about 2 weeks left of training I got put on medical profile, and was no longer going to be graduating from basic, I just kinda gave up on myself eventually after 8 months I finally was sent home. Now I’m just some shithead 21 year old who still lives with his mom, ripped away from his dream. I don’t deserve to be a member of society knowing I took an Oath, only to break it, knowing some gave their lives for the service i basically quit. I failed myself, I failed my “brothers and sisters ( if I even have the right to call them that)”.

It's gonna take a while as my mother is pretty much healthy but my father has stage 4 lung cancer and might die soon should something bad come up. I also started and stopped cutting myself about a week ago but I think about it a lot whenever I go to school or any place and anytime I feel immense stress or other negative feelings. I wonder if I even have a depressive disorder even if I'm told by my therapist that I feel depressed after he hears what I had to say because it feels that I'm just faking my emotions for attention or just to make my life easier and at the same time I don't really feel like I actually feel anything because of the medications I've been given which include a French concentration medication after switching from ritalin as well as venlafaxine, as well as aripiprazole, however at some point I stopped taking the aripiprazole as I thought it was affecting my ability to stay awake as due to an apparent mix up I was told to take it in the morning instead of the evening when it's apparently supposed to be prescribed.

I have recently been thinking of buying fentanyl and taking a large dose(with no tolerance) by myself in a secluded place where no body could get some mardan in me. but I want to have a llan and openly tell my family what I plan to do.

depression,"I think I will be sad forever. (M23) So, as far as I remember myself, I was sad as a child and from then till this very moment, I was seeking female acceptance.
I won't talk about the roots of the problem here.
The past is the past and it cannot be changed.
Let's talk about now and the future.
Well, I think I'm either dying alone or settling for far less than I want and need in order to just have something.
I'm taking medication for 2 years now, both antidepressants and sedatives so I can sleep.
I can't do that anymore.
They won't help me and I cannot help myself.
Girls and relationships are the only thing I can think about.
I get sad when I see women I like because I know I can't be with them.
I'm seeing what I want everywhere I go and I simply cannot have it.
Sometimes, I won't leave the house so I won't see anyone I might like.
They say that I am good looking and nice but women won't choose me.
Maybe, I'm too nice.
Okay, I had 2 or 3 girls over the past 5 years but I think it just happened and it's not so easy for me to date someone.
Actually I can't even meet a new person so that they'll get to know me better.
And taking this into consideration, I'm inclined to believe that I won't meet a new person that will want to he a part of my life.
You know, that very important part for me.

And my question is;

How can I stop caring for girls so I'm not getting hurt anymore from all the rejections and the fact that I can't meet anyone I like and they liking me too?
They say I must stop chasing it and just go with the flow.
But if I do that, my possibilities are even fewer because no one I like will ever flirt me first.

Please be nice to me. :)

depression,"Thoughts on therapy Hello folks!

Sometimes I think about when I went to therapy for the first time a couple of years ago (even though I'm dealing with depression and anxiety since I was 15 yo). I just can't believe that when the therapist asked me about suicidal thoughts I said that I didn't have any. Guess what? It wasn't true at all. I think I was just afraid of saying it or to admit to myself. Eventually a pandemic happened and I couldn't go to therapy anymore so he never knew how I really feel. Plus no one know about my suicidal tendencies. 

I need to let someone know about this, I'm leaving this here because I know that here someone will embrace my thoughts and share my same experience.

Have a good day folks! Stay strong, love you all &lt;3"

depression,"I was doing so well. For 4 to 5 months I was working out, slowly regaining my ability to enjoy things again. I was losing weight and started to slowly do things creatively (writing and a youtube project).

Last month I got sick twice in a row. First there was a stomach virus that completely wrecked me followed by a flu like disease that may have been Covid. Since then I’ve been struggling to not feel like drowning in mental sludge. I try to pick up my routine of working out and watching what I eat but I don’t feel the push I normally feel to let me do the things I need to do. Like something is actively making me more tired the more I try to break free from numbness. Like quicksand. 

My main coping mechanism is eating and since nothing interests me again I think about eating nonstop. Eventually I indulge and feel worse for doing so. I don’t want to lose the progress I’ve made but it constantly feels like I have no control over my cravings. 

I know I just have to keep trying but it feels like every try gets slightly harder and I’m afraid of where my mental state is headed. It feels like I’m a bystander watching a train wreck that’s about to happen. The tracks are broken but there’s no way to stop the train before it gets there. 

I have a gf and two kids who need me. They can survive on their own but they love me and don’t want to see me this way. All the energy I have left to keep trying is because of them and I’m trying to hold on and get back on track but so far Ive failed for the past three weeks. It’s becoming hard for me to make it unnoticeable to outsiders. Thoughts of ending it are coming back. I have nothing good to say about myself. I feel like a failure. I’m running out of tries

I feel dumb. I can’t express myself the way I want to and I don’t think I ever can or ever will be smart enough to learn how. My self-awareness hurts me. I overthink everything while at the same time thinking there’s not much going on up there. It feels like I’m thinking nonstop but when I try to think of what I’m thinking about it feels like I wasn’t really thinking anything. As if my thinking is an illusion. 

I feel so lost and I’m too hard on myself. I don’t know what else to say. There’s a lot but I don’t feel like typing anymore. Or thinking. Or being conscious. I want to sleep."
depression,"How do you convince someone not to kill themselves when you yourself don't see the point in life? I have a friend that's going through a really hard time in life. Her father died, she has no one to rely on. She feels unloved, unwanted, worthless etc... She keeps telling me she wants to follow her dad. She's only 23 so I feel like she has so much to live for. 

The problem is that I myself have been depressed for almost 10 years. I honestly don't see any point in living. The only reason is I'm alive is to prevent causing more pain to my family members. 

I keep telling my friend ""be strong, life is meant to be hard but once you get through the miserable parts, life can be amazing."" Im just lying to her because I honestly don't feel like life is worth it. I really don't want my friend to hurt themselves but idk how to deal with this."

I wake up, I'm thankful I slept through the night
'Cause that is the only time I feel alright
Keep my eyes closed so I sleep the sadness away
When I wake up, I'm sure that it won't be the same

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself, ""I don't think of death""
All the ups, all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
'Cause the truth is, I'm fucked up

The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah we're all fucked up, it's true (all fucked up like you)
(Yeah, we're all fucked up) and the truth is, they don't hear the words we say
Yeah, they all just turn away (don't hear the words we say, yeah we're all fucked up)

If I wake up tomorrow just know that I tried
To find a way out without saying goodbye

All the panic, depression, the hurt and regret
Lying to myself ""I don't think of death""
All the ups, all the downs, all the petty concerns
My whole world's imploding, I can't find the words
'Cause the truth is, I'm fucked up

The truth is that I'm all fucked up like you
Yeah we're all fucked up, it's true (all fucked up like you)

depression,"Talk to someone is the most useless advice. Especially when you're on autistic spectrum People just don't listen to me. I feel like I always talk to a brickwall. It's more about shitty experience with the human race, rather than aspergers and lack of social skills. 

It's kind of funny how ""normal"" people can find smartass  terminology for being tired of people's shit.

It's not apasthasia, or sth like this. I'm just sick of you.

What's the point of talking with people and be ignored again?

What's the point of learning to say NO if those fuckers act like they can't hear you? 

BTW And if I don't reply to your passive aggresive pseudo funny commentary about my behaviour, it's because I can sense you're stupid, immature dumbass, but I can't tell that out loud, because as usual no one is gonna defend me. 

It feels like no one gives a damn when someone is being asshole to me, but everybody knows when I fight back.

depression,"Hey guys 👋 Never posted here before,  at least I think. If I did I  don't remember, because depression does do that to you. Anyways, I just moved on to campus for university, and I was hoping that something here, anything would maybe make me feel less shitty about being me. I got a work-study internship, I have a nice roommate, and some others that I  just met (they seem cool enough too) and I'm missing home. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to move a couple hours away, just for mental health reasons because my gramps and I fight a lot and our relationship is unhealthy at times. I don't actually know where to go with this. I  feel like  shit. I feel lonely, because I just  feel  out of place. Due to  an episode I'm still dealing with, I slacked on homework for  all  of my classes  and  am having  to desperately catch up. My roommate  was nice  enough  to introduce me to  her friends, and  idk.  They  just  are  so  normal  that I feel  I don't fit  in. I always  felt  I was  one  of the weird ones, as  all  through  highschool I would  make  friends  with  the nerds and loners, and  was  never  popular.  Many  people didn't like  me bc  I  think  my quietness came  off as antisocial, and  maybe I  have  an rbf  lol  idk.  Either  way, I  can't have  a  conversation  with normal  people,  comfortably!!!!Dude  as  I  type this I  feel  like  such  a  pick me,  but I'm dead  serious,  man.  How do  people  do  this  and not  be awkward as hell. God  man I  wish I  weren't such  a  dunce,  and  I  wish I  weren't so  awkward,  and  didn't have depression,  and  just were  capable  of believing in  myself. It gets  really tiring  just doing and  always being  anxious  and embarrassing  yourself  all  the  time  with  no  redemption  or  break  at  the  end  of  it.  I  just  pray I  meet  and  keep  some friends  who actually  share my  interests someday  soon so I can feel  less alone. I  met  one  dude  into anime and who was  also kind  of  socially awkward,  so  that  was  cool.  And  at least I  have  my  baby  boy  kitty  w  me,  so  I'm  not  too lonely.  Idk.  Pray  for  me guys--  pray I  don't  cry  everyday this upcoming school  year,  please."
depression,"I keep hoping things will get better I feel like each time I get really down, particularly when the suicidal thoughts start to come in, I had the smallest hope that things will get better. But now, after the most recent episode I've been looking back retrospectively and realised that objectively- my life is better. I've got so much of what I was hoping for in the past but...nothing has changed. I'm not happier, I don't feel any better or even OK. What happens if I get everything I want and its still not enough? I think I've been unhappy for so long I just don't know how to be anything else. I'm never going to get better."
depression,It is already terrible when you are depressed But when you realize that you lost all your friends even though they did not do anything bad. Nothing is comparable to that feeling.

depression,"I feel empty and hopeless I’ve felt empty for awhile and I don’t know what started it. I’m in the marines and I haven’t been home for 2 years cause of covid, I miss my family and my home and I can’t visit them until I get out. I feel worthless and bored and the only way I can put it into words is emptiness. Today my girlfriend wanted to separate or take a break because it’s too much stress for her(she’s back in the states) and I told her I didn’t want her to do that but she made up her mind, that has really driven the knife into my heart and I’ve felt numb and just so goddamn empty. I don’t know what to do, I’m so sick of feeling this way and I can’t ask for help because I don’t want to be kicked out. So I’ve come to you guys in hopes you could help me get out of this hole."
depression,"My father hit a new low and I feel helpless Hi everyone, it’s my first time posting on Reddit and English isn’t my native language so I hope I’ll do it right...

I’m here for my (34f) father (63). I’ll try to make it short but there’s a lot to unpack. I’ll do my best.

My dad has always been in depression. This is not something we talk about, together or in the family, never. I actually came to that conclusion myself by connecting the few informations I got, especially from my partner with whom my father talked about it or at least told him he’s taking antidepressants for a while (probably 30+ years). I’ve always known the mood swings, him isolating himself even during family gatherings, the anger issues too, a little. 

There were ups and downs but it was never okay. I’m gonna be honest, I never really did anything about it, I talked with him once but it was clear he didn’t want to share anything with me. And I also chose to protect myself, I had a depressive episode too, I have my own traumas and anxiety (mostly because of this, probably) to deal with. We had a few bad fights because of things he did because of depression (at least this is my thought). My partner helped me a lot with this, but that’s not about me.

A few years ago, my dad retired and it got worse. Then he bought a house near mine to renovate and rent. And it got worse. We did everything with my partner to help him doing the renovations so he could be a little less anxious about it. I must admit that I feel guilty about this because I’m the one who told him the house was on sale and that I hoped the people buying it would be nice (we live in a small village). Then he bought, without even consulting my mom.

This summer, my dad was a mess. When we reunited with my two sisters we had a talk about him for the first time. My younger sister who still lives with my parents bursted into tears, saying it was awful to see him like this everyday. But still no one talks about it, my mom never talks about it even when I try to initiate the conversation. We agreed to be careful and to seek solutions, even if we didn’t know how. A few weeks later, my dad talked with my partner. He finally found a new therapist (his previous one retired a few months ago) and she told him she would change his antidepressants because he’s taking the previous one for too long. He seemed a bit relieved and maybe even hopeful. I was glad, finally there were some changes.

Fast forward to yesterday. We were supposed to go to my parents with my partner and my son for my dad’s birthday, at 4pm. While I’m driving, not far to their house, I see my dad driving in the opposite direction. This was weird but maybe he just had a small errand to do. I arrive there and my mom is not aware that my dad left. She seems surprised. I go inside and go to meet my sister in her room and instantly, when she sees me, she bursts into tears, telling me it got even worse. I was surprised, I thought things were better, I’m totally lost.
Then for like 15 minutes, my mom tries to reach my dad, he doesn’t answer, she even asks me to call my SIL who lives near the house my dad is renovating to know if he’s there because ""we don’t know what he could do there"" with tears in her eyes, ""you know what his brother did"". (His brother k*lled himself 25 years ago).

Finally, my dad comes back. He says he was posting a letter. My son was happy to give him his gift, he said thanks, nothing else. We had cake without him because he didn’t want some, he didn’t even sat at the table with us, he was on a chair beside us. He didn’t talk, it was awful. I couldn’t look at him. I wanted to leave, it’s selfish I know but as I said, I also need to protect myself but even more, protect my son. I know how it feels to be a kid in this atmosphere, and what it can do to you. Everyone was being super careful not to cry, not to say anything about what happened, it was a joke, it was awful.

I don’t know what to do. I want to help but talking about it seem impossible. My mom always changes the subject. I want my sister out, I told her she can come live with us, my partner is okay with that but she told me ""if I leave it would make things worse"" and it breaks my hear. I called and explained everything to my other sister, she told me she would talk about it and ask advices to her therapist tomorrow.

I don’t know what to do. Do you have any advices please? I can’t bear to think about my sister and my mom who are there and hurting too. I don’t know what to do.

Ps. I don’t know it it’s relevant but I live in France."
depression,"Fuck you At this point id rather be homeless, i cant deal with the financial responsibilities on my own, and i dont want to be around anyone, im so tired of being alright, i just want to go. Im not ok i dont know why people are so easy to lie to, they just are, but i dont think anybody really cares about how i feel. And i dont care if they did at this point anyway, i wish i would just die already."
depression,"I faked a personality to hide my depression, and I stopped So bit of back story; I have had depression since I was about 11 or so and got formally diagnosed with depression almost a year ago.

And to hide it I made this alter personality. This was something that I had all ready been doing sense I could remember. The alter personality was originally based off the dumb but likable character in kids shows. I got these traits from characters like Cat valentine (Disney) , pinkie pie (my little pony), bubbles (power puff girls) or Karen Smith (mean girls).  I still held true to my own traits, but these became hidden and erased to others in this alter personality.

When I showed my real emotions, or a real part of my personality. It became me trying to be edgy (it's kind of funny now, but I was showing signs of depression as a kid and it became over looked).

The alter personality was something I used a lot as a kid, I'm not really sure why I did this, but it was well received. People liked this person. And when I grew older it became easier to fake, the alter personality had more depth and became believable considering my age. 

And when I got to middle school that was me, this bubbly easy going person. I was kind of liked and I had quite a lot of 'friends'. I wasn't popular, in fact I got picked on by the 'popular' kids (Because I was going threw my first depressive episode, and I couldn't hide it as well. I would slip up and start crying in school and people noticed). 

I can see right threw a nice up front (ironic right) and I could tell the people I was becoming friends with where toxic. They loved to have their ego boosted by some ""dumb"" and ""ugly"" person, that would support them and shower them with fished for complements. I knew this and of their manipulation and would get around it and it would frustrate them. But I didn't care being surrounded was better than being alone. Soon I became so done with them and began breaking up with most of them and moving on to others. It didn't help and I kept running into the same type of people and not running away. I was described as ""A pretty boring person but nice."".

When I would tell my ' friends' about my depression or show who I was, it would get brushed off. Because they viewed me has a poorly written character to fit the blonde stereotype. I couldn't possibly have depression, have any problems, or thoughts outside their construct of me. 

I've never been a ""dumb"" person, I feel as though I am pretty average.

Covid happened, and I was sent to therapy for other reasons. I got the help I needed, and stopped faking. Now everyone around me thinks I changed, I have, but this was who I have always been. I'm now aware depression effects me and there is no point to hide it to make others comfortable.

Anyway I'm in high school now, I simply can't find connection. I want to make friends but it's a little discouraging, because being a teenager is about ""finding yourself, and experimenting"". And having gone to therapy, I grew a lot as a person. I know who I am,  I'm okay with change, I'm not insecure anymore, and I know no one cares about my class or the way I dress. But everyone else does, and I can't make friends who are older than me and have reached that point, their not going to want to hang out because there is a age gap, and I don't have that maturity that is reached with age. Or if they do then there is probably something wrong with them ex. pedophile.  

But people my age, no hate to them I know they will grow up but still. I don't really want to listen to you talk about your 'man', or how you think you like \[name\] better (again no hate to them this is normal behavior for my age). Or how much you hate your mom who doesn't believe you have DID, because you show no symptoms of DID.  

And the people who I am 'friends' with think of me has ""calm, and dull"". I am thought boring and not having a interesting personality, because they will not stop talking about the new trendy mental illness they think they have/knowingly fake, to actually listen to me talk about how mine is keeping me from feeling well and making it hard to socialize. I have a personality, and it's not based on the collection of conflicting mental illnesses and disorders I claim to have, and 'researched', or that I am queer. There is nothing wrong with being queer and I'm not questioning whether someone is or isn't and I just respect it. These people are making it apart of their personality, and ultimately negatively effecting the community. But take away that, there's not much left to look at.

It's really troubling when depression is not taken seriously as it is. And a confession is often meet with ""me too bestie"" or ""at least your depression will always be there for you"". Most don't understand what it is like. Even making friends with people who understand what it's like, is hard, spaces made to support people with depression have become filled with people who are looking for attention because they're ""so broken"" from Jake breaking up with them after their week long relationship. 

My older friends say I have changed too much, and have lost interest.  

I don't think of myself as boring, others do because I don't heavily follow trends, I'm not interested in dating (I don't think I have to explain this one), and I'm not trying too hard to act grown because I'm not.

And I am done with putting up with people so I can feel surrounded."
depression,"Just realized that I was out of reality I didn’t mean to hurt anyone in my life but I realized that I was crazy for awhile and this episode is over. Im gonna be okay, like myself again goofy and happy - I literally have been apologizing to everyone because I didn’t even know months were going by with my insanity. I’m realizing that I had psychosis but I damaged some relationships in my life that I didn’t mean to at all. Shit sucks, take care of yourself."
depression,"Feeling like in a black hole It sucks you feel motivated for some time make plans then suddenly this monster take over you again.
I want to do hardwork i want to do something big in life but it's not letting me.

I feel worthless being a 25 years old male.i know I can do anything I want in life but this depression stopping me to do anything.

Here I came with a confusion,is depression is all about mindset or it's something happens in brain which cause us to feel like that?
Mean like chemical imbalance.
I don't want to take those pills which gives me sleep.
I get good sleep but when I wake up I feel tired and emotional imbalance.
I don't feel energetic even after eating a lot,no weight again,a constant fatigue and living in head 24/7."
depression,"Where did you go? Hey. There is so much to tell. I have family and loved ones I could talk to, but there is no one I want to talk to. So Im talking to you. This could get long. Or maybe it wont. I hope you dont mind listening. I understand if you dont tho. 

So im 41. Im currently seperated from my wife, will be divorced in November. This will be my second divorce and let me tell you, boy did I fuck the monkey on this one. I hurt her. Bad. Have other posts about it if youre interested, but dont need to get into it here. The point isnt what happened. See, until last week I thought she was my soulmate. Shes been my best friend for years, well, until she told me to kick rocks, but due to some info I learned last week, nah, I dont believe that anymore. For other reasons, Im not even sure she ever truly loved me. Oh, she loved me as best she could and she always said it was unconditional and all these other things that, as I look back on it, she never really backed up. But its cool. Shes human. When I found out what I did last week, it spun me into a deep, deep dark place. One which had me in the bed most of 5 straight days. It was tough. But it kicked off a......transition, which is ultimately what this is about. 

See, it was during that time, endlessly replaying my failed relationship in my head, mostly the great stuff,  coupled with recent events from May to now, when the pieces started coming together, and, while I do still miss her and the relationship, I kinda feel better about the way its turning out. Mostly because I know there are things from when we were together that I still dont know about (she told me as much). I wrote her a couple emails practically begging her to come clean. She previously alluded to whatever shes not telling me being so detrimental that it would destroy me. Im pretty certain i have an idea of what it pertains to. Anyway, the idea over the emails I sent her, was that I would take that info, and use it as the catalyst, the final nail in the coffin so to speak. Give me this info so I can hate you and finally chow down on this .45 caliber snack. But, no dice. She wouldnt budge. Nobody who is depressed and suicidal wants to die, we just want the pain to stop. Still do, but, I'll get to that. 

Anyway, a friend I've been hanging out with is the only one I vaguely let know what kind of state I was in (aside from my mom whom i've been living with since seperating. I dont talk to her about anything, but she obviously saw me shamble around only when neccessary without picking my head up higher than chest level. I didnt say 10 words all week, so, she knew). Anyway,.my friend was/is concerned about me, so one night she came spend the night to check on me. We were just laying there and she was being her sweet, caring, wonderful self when she asked the question that would turn out to be the most profound question anyone has ever asked me; with her head and hand on my chest, cuddled up close and holding me, she looked up at me with clearest, most compassionate blue eyes and said 

""Where did you go?"" 

We've known each other a little over a year. Always work acquaintances, nothing more. Recently we both needed a friend I suppose so we started hanging out. She'd been an angel.  She knows the very basics of why I was in that state,  no details whatsoever. Obviously tho she knows the me lying there with her is very different than the person she's seen around for a year and then only just started hanging out with. She hadn't seen this me before. The depressed me. I hadnt seen that severe a me in forever either. After she asked me that question, over the next several days, the depression kinda..transformed. i'm still aching with hurt on the insise sure, but now, it's more of an ""I accept that any hope I ever had for a happy life is gone. I accept that my time here is limited"". And that thought has offered a strange sense of peace. 

My birthday is in 13 days. The last 2 have been memorable. On my 41st birthday, my step-dad exhibited the first symptom of Covid. He was a healthy 74 year old. He died before Thanksgiving.  

On my 40th birthday however, that one there really stands out. 

My dad was a fucking prick. At about 8 years old he started telling me how much better the world would be if I werent in it. That if it werent for me, he and my mom wouldnt have any problems. When I was 12, he stood in my doorway, with tears in his eyes, woke me from sleep, mumbled something and raised his arm and pointed his .38 revolver at me. Four years of those comments ran through my head and the only thing I could think to do was throw my Superman blanket over my head. That'll stop the bullets, right? 
He didnt shoot. Mom wasnt home. My cousin and little brother were. I didnt realize this until I told her myself, but my brother never knew about that until 2015. I thought my cousin, who was 21 at the time would have said something. Found out for sure that wasnt the case when in 2016 in the midst of a breakdown I verbalized that story to my mom. She didnt know either. The look on her face, tears flowing like a river and instantly I wished I never told her. 
Well, he persisted until I was 17 or 18 with the ugliness, until finally, one night, he was bringing my little brother home from his weekend (they had seperated about 4 months before this) and I heard my mom start yelling and screaming and crying downstairs. ""Mom whats wrong""?? 
""He told me he's gonna kidnap your brother and that I'd never see him again"". My brother was 10.  I went outside and lit a cigarette. Waited. Wasnt long, 5 or 10 minutes, car pulls up, mom starts to rush outside. ""Go in the house!"" She must have seen something in my eyes. She listened. Lil bro got out the car, passenger side. ""Hey bro, go see momma. Get some ice cream"".  I stood in front the car. He hugged me and ran in. At the drivers side, window started to roll down. ""What!?""  

""Get your fat ass out this car right now and I'll kill you with my bare hands right here in this driveway but that is the LAST fucking time you ever make my momma cry"". 

The window went up. He reversed. Gone. The years of having to listen to him tell me how worthless I was or how he'd like to get me in a room with no windows were over. 

For the next 23 or so years, i tried to forgive and reconcile. Of those 23 I dont believe we had contact except for a total of 7 of them. He literally spent those decades lamenting how he'd like to die and get it over with. Literally, he was bedridden from about 2011 or so until 2019. 

October 17, 2019.  Phone rings bout 9:30 am. My older brother. Here comes the first happy birthday, thanks bro! 

""Hey man. Anybody call you?"" 
""Not yet, why"". 
""Daddy died about an hour ago"". 

Well, fuck. This mother fucker literally spent DECADES hoping, WAITING to do, and on my 40th birthday....his one last FUCK YOU to me. 

Ha. Or so I thought. If anybody could pull off this shit from beyond the grave, it'd be him. 
There were ""some"" good times with him. We're italian. He was flashy. Gifts, trying to buy love. He had this nickname for me sometimes, ""stronze"" (pronounced stroon-za). 
I always thought it meant like youngin, or little one. 

Literally 2 DAYS AGO I happened to randomly find out it actually means ""piece of shit"". 

So my birthday is in 13 days, and I cant help but wonder, or hope that maybe, just maybe, for the hat trick, it'll maybe be my turn. Mom is finally gonna go get to bury step dad's ashes in his home country. Leaves Thursday. Wanna guess when she is scheduled to return. Yep. The 17th. I'll have the house to myself for 10 days. 10 days of (hopefully) peace. Dont think I'm gonna stay here the whole time. It is my birthday after all. Where might I go? 

I just might go give that cocksucker a piece of mind. 
Happy birthday, stronze."
depression,"I haven't stopped thinking about suicide for a few weeks now. Im obsessing. But I want to share some thoughts I guess. Hope everyone is feeling ok. I've been thinking about ending it a lot. I've completely withdrawn. As much as I can anyways. I've been thinking about methods. Who would find me. What I'd miss. What I wouldn't miss. What people would think and say. I doubt they'd be very surprised. 

Impulsivity is what I want to talk about. I was just watched this video where a psychiatrist was talking about how the majority of suicides are decided within minutes of it actually happening. Up to about half an hour. Meaning most people who have committed suicide woke up that day not knowing they would take their life. I find this fact very worrying. I am not making this post as one of those ""PleAse dOnt kilL youSeLf"" things. I just think a decision like this warrants thinking it out. At least a little bit. 

It just scares me because I am a very impulsive person. I get angry and depressed. I get infuriated with myself. It leads to explosions of anger. And I take it out on myself through different ways. It certainly hurts though. I'm scared one day soon ill get very angry. Angry enough to where I say thats enough. And without thinking it through I just disappear. I wouldn't be mad about it. I just dont want to hurt my few good friends and few family members. Even when I feel horrible I know to just keep going. Its not like it matters anyways. But for every thought I have that keeps me alive, its seems two more pop up that want me dead. Almost like I dont have a choice. And that I deserve it. I hope I'm wrong. Try and have a good day everyone."

depression,"How do you get through the day? This isn't a rhetorical question, as I'm actively seeking help on this issue.

I'm a 22-year-old who works as a teacher's aide in an elementary school. I love my job, but depression makes it hard for me to find joy in it lately. I wake up with no will or motivation to go to work, or to do anything really. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist, I have an appointment with my therapist today actually so I will ask her this question too. Because lately all I want to do is die. But I don't really want to die, I just don't want to live. I hope that makes sense.

Currently I usually just try to just go an hour at a time, waiting for my 8 hours of work to be over. But even after work, I feel the same, just watching the clock for the next hour of the day.

I don't really know what I'm looking for as far as answers. Anything is helpful. Thanks for reading."
depression,"Caught off guard by depressed bf (ex) Everything was so good. I keep thinking I was in denial. I keep looking up “signs he loves you”, only to feel like a fool for denying my instincts that he did love me when he showed all the signs and more. 
He has been depressed for most of the past year, we were together for 1.5 and it never affected our relationship. I saw him break down multiple times due to work stress/financial stress/feelings or inadequacy and low self esteem. I always comforted him. He also suffered with retroactive jealousy. He became distant (no longer talking feelings) and short in 3 weeks. Then he was reckless and got a concussion. I took care of him for 2 weeks, until he could talk to me. Once I approached it, he broke up with me. He talked about 2 super small things that happened (we bickered) and said his feelings changed. I don’t know. I’m lost. He said I’m amazing, I’ve grown a lot this year, and I’m the hottest girl/sex he’s ever had. I am sooo confused. This is so out of the blue to me and so heartbreaking."

this world is just painful"
depression,"Self esteem issues? Why do I constantly feel like I won’t be able to live life to the fullest, have social connections due to my height, body structure and hair. I have this feeling where I’ll be constantly looked down upon. And I hate it so much. 5’6. Im excelling in every other aspects of life… as 21 y/o that has a 6 figure job, a house, a car and other investments. I built a nice life so far… but I just feel lonely and unable to be social. It’s not just dating, social aspect of my life doesn’t exist. I know people say “oh you don’t need friends.” My question to them is… what’s the point of life then? Work, make money 💰 eat and sleep? Is that what life should be? I’m fine one day… the next day I’m a freaking mess. I’m doing amazing… and then get hit by a truck feeling. 

Thanks for reading guys… this is a rant but I’m open for discussion. And please don’t bash at me. I don’t think I need more of that. I get enough of that internally."
depression,"I don't know what to put for a title Hi I just joined this sub. I'm gonna warn that this is going to be a very long post. I wanna start with a question. Why are so many people so rude and evil to me? For context, I'm in college, art school specifically. I have to take usually 3 buses and a train to get to school. It takes me around 1 and a half to 2 hours to get to my school. I could not find my lamp that I use to light up my still life, but more on that later. It's raining where I live and I am typing this while I'm on the train. While I was taking the bus to the train station the floor was wet and I slipped and scraped my knee and I hit my back on something. I called my mom and she yelled at me, saying that I cant handle being on the bus. It made me hate myself even more than I already was because I couldn't find my lamp. I understand she is stressed but she takes out her emotions on me and my sister  constantly. I also called my boyfriend but he didnt pick up probably because he was sleeping. He is like the only person i have to talk to, but he has a life too so i cant talk to him about how i feel all the time. Also, about the lamp, I suspect i may have left it in the classroom because it's nowhere to be found in my apartment. We are also moving because our ceiling caved in and the landlord doesnt want to fix it, so everything is in boxes. I'm having so much anxiety because my still life painting is a complete asshole and I know for a fact he is going to get very angry with me about the lamp and then he is going to lecture the class about it like he always does when one kid does something he doesnt like. Another thing I absolutely hate about him is that he keeps rubbing my shoulders while looking over my shoulder at my painting. I'm about to get off the train now. Anyway i also hate that i had to email him explaining my two mental disorders, GAD and major depression because I did something late. I was diagnosed with them when I had time for therapy a few years ago, but now I dont have time for therapy because most of the time I'm either at work or I'm in school or I'm packing. Also, about my job, my manager changed the schedule at the very last minute like she always does and she gave me a hard time about it when I called her about it. I realized I barely even talked about how I feel yet. So  I fucking hate myself every day because I struggle to get things done asap, I always wait until the last minute because when I'm home I just mentally scream at myself to start doing homework in the little time that I have, but I just cant do it. Also I have tons of anxiety going to my still life painting class because I have that teacher and being in his presence makes me feel absolutely terrible. Also the reason why I have to take such a long commute to school is because my dad sucks. He was supposed to teach me how to drive but he is a terrible driver and every time he would let me practice in his car he would scream at me and make me feel terrible. He made me take 3 drivers tests and I failed every time. When I got home each time I would cry my eyes out for like an hour and he would hear me crying and tell me to grow up. My dad also used to drive me to school and scream and yell at me about my mother and insult me while I was in the car with him. He would make me cry and I would have to hold back tears in my classes. He hates that I'm going to art school because he wanted me to be a nurse but that's simply not what I want to do. He would always mention that while driving me to college. I cant talk to anybody about my problems and i wish i had time for a therapist but every day I dont have school I'm at work most of the time and the store is small and a lot of people quit where I work because of my manager. I cant quit because I need money to pay for 3 forms of transportation which is expensive. I have to pay for 2 different towns busses and the train. I also have to buy my own food because we often dont have much in the fridge. I wish I had someone to talk to about my problems but I cant tell my mom because she starts yelling and crying because she is stressed too and I cant tell her how I feel because a few times she didnt like how I felt and she threatened to commit suicide. As you can tell I've been in a shitty place in my life and I could write more but this post would end up being a whole book. I want to die every day and I dont know what else to say. Sorry for the length of this post but if anyone has advice I would appreciate it a lot. I'm on my commute so I cant write a TLDR."
depression,I need to vent. I can’t take it anymore. It’s 5am here and I can’t sleep because something is bothering me.
depression,"I feel like glass waiting to be smashed. I feel like I’m always at the brink. Sometimes it gets clouded but it only comes back, and every time I’m here I tell myself it can wait, I can handle it, I don’t need to seek help. I hate my environment but I won’t do anything about it. I don’t like the people around me but they have never wronged me. I don’t want to be this way, or be here, but even thinking about leaving here just makes me even more scared. I think about suicide but I don’t think I’ll ever go through with it. I always find a reason not to, be it because it would hurt others or because then my cat will wonder why I disappeared one day. I feel like I lost myself and who I was so many years ago. I don’t recognize who I see in the mirror anymore. I hate how I look, how I sound. I don’t like me and I don’t like thinking about me. I wish someone could tell me something to help, but even when I do talk to someone I feel like there’s nothing gained. Just told that I can’t wallow in self suffering or something similar. I wish I could do anything, an interest in anything. My future feels bleak and I feel nothing will ever change. I hope someone smashes the glass for me one day, because I won’t do it."
depression,"Should I go to a psychologist?  I am by nature introvert. For most of my life, I was so busy with my imaginary world that I have made very few friends. From the start of this lockdown, things got worse. I became so lethargic that I continuously failed to do important jobs. I kept forgetting many information. I neglected my boyfriend and he ultimately left. When he accused me of neglecting him, at first I did not believe. But then I found out he was telling the truth. Things were slipping out of my hand from over a year. Only I did not realize.

I was having difficulty to call a friend, or talk to anybody. after an year of solitary confinement, I was finding it hard even to get out. In office calls, I was keeping my video off. Its not like I did not tried to change things, but it did not work.

Then the most unfortunate thing happened. My cat was sick from some time and I had to monitor her regularly. She was quiet and calm (opposite to her nature) for at least three days but I failed to notice. I noticed when conditions worsened. I rushed her to the vet but it was too late.

I am devastated and overridden with guilt. Now it is hard to look at myself on the mirror.

Was my behaviour a result of some kind of mental problem, or it seems I am really that bad? Can psychologists cure my eccentric nature? I don't want to hurt or harm anybody else because of my irresponsible behaviour. I am trying to correct it but continuously failing."
depression,"god i feel so alone what have i done to deserve this. why do i barely have anyone to talk to. why does nobody care enough to put effort into our friendship. why do i let people that don’t make me feel good about myself, walk all over me. why am i so pathetic. why am i so forgettable and unimportant to everybody. why am i the afterthought. why am i the one who’s left out. why do people take advantage of me."

depression,"I suck at life - Need help Hi Reddit

I just got divorced from my wife whom I've been together  for 13 years. I found out she was cheating on me. After that I don't know if this I just the first time I caught her - the trust is no longer there.

Throughout the years of our relationship I've always supported via her business, to achive her dreams and it was our plan to switch roles once that is done.

However, now that her business is established. She all of a sudden feels liberated from me. I feel betrayed and angry.

Worst thing is I've lost myself giving everything to her. I appreciate I was not the perfect husband but I always wanted to work things out. No matter what I was not gonna leave her.

But now I feel she has moved on with her life to better pastures I feel left behind.

Was I just lazy? Was I just looking to shift my accountability for my life? Am I a bad person expecting the favour to be returned?

Was I too gullible?

I feel manipulated and used. Now at 36, I feel like I have to start from the beginning. Which makes me feel like I suck at life and falling behind.

I had to move out, go home to my mom's because the emotional truma is affecting my mental health and ability to get motivated to do anything. 

I get anxiety attacks and depression.

Feeling really down at the moment."
depression,"suicidal ideation I've had depression as long as I can remember. I think I was 9 when I first started feeling what would later be diagnosed as ""depressed"". I've struggled with near-constant thoughts of suicide.

I'm 27 now and I still have constant suicidal thoughts. Not like a constant ""I should kill myself"" but more like when I'm having a bad day at work, there's a subconscious part of me that says ""If it gets too bad, you can just run into traffic."" 

Or like my parents have custody of my nephew, but they haven't taken Covid seriously and I think about losing my nephew, who has already had a rough go in life and if he were to die, I think I might genuinely follow.

I don't really see my suicidal ideation as a problem. It has pretty much always been, and I think it's kind of comforting that I can just choose to end it if the cons outweigh the pros on staying alive. But my husband sees it very differently and he begs me to get professional help, even though we truly cannot afford it. 

Maybe I do need the help, but I simply can't justify spending the money on therapy when we're barely making ends meet. 

Sometimes I think I might actually try it, but most of the time I think it's really just a thought that gets me through my day."

depression,"""What a shit show..."" Notes of a mind traveller #3. Howdy, Lust here. 

And here we go again... 

""Notes of a mind traveller #3.""

For today's ""Notes of mind a Traveller"" I thought about to start with explaining why did I choose that name.

I allways loved Traveling since I was a kid. As you have noticed by now... (That is if anyone is even reading these Notes), I am a person that takes a lot of notes about social behavior and people in general... a ""Watcher"" you could say, I usually try to understand why people are like they are, that obligated me to be a ""Traveler"" In people's mind.. So that's where I took the ideia from.

Now to the real notes. 


So, I know that I am releasing these notes a little earlier but, I have a good explanation and I think the following topic deserves a ""Notes"" itself. 

So, last Friday I got the notice that my sister, she allegedly attempted suicide by hanging herself.. Got the notice from my father, he didn't look to stressed about the situation itself. I can understand why... 

And quote... ""I don't even want to evolve myself in the situation, don't want to have people talking about me in the city..."" and end quote. 

he spoke those words with a quite feeling of ""disappointment"". I can understand why people don't want to involve themselves in a fucked up situation but, it still quite shows that he doesn't care as much about the situation. (It's not the first time that he does this) 

In the other side we have my mother, She was pretty ""Angry"" about the situation to put it in a simple way. 

And quote ""I am not angry, I am disappointed."" And end quote.

I can believe that she disappointed but, I can see that she is quite angry about the situation also, wish is completely normal. She been visiting her so far my sister said that she can't remember anything that happened, looks like that her husband found her and done CPR, that's where my mother thinks that she did not attempt suicide but her own husband tried to kill her instead.

I can not confirm anything since I haven't been able to visit her so far. Hopefully I can eventually. That's where i think that my emocional numbess comes in handy I would say. Normally I am more a kind ""I think before doing"" than the other way around.

 (I am not bragging about my emocional numbess, just to put it clear out there, please don't take me in a wrong way, Read ""Notes of a mind traveller #1 and #2 to get yourself updated.)

Anyway, while talking to my mom i asked how did the mark looked like and she said, that it was a red mark not blue around her front part of her neck. As far as I am aware. (That's what she told me). 

And now remembering about it actually.. My sister and her husband do have a domestic violence passed, last time it was around 2020, September? Perhaps I am not so sure. Anyway, looks like that her husband used or still hits her, whenever they have an argument, and it gets pretty fiscal. (They have 2 kids, one is a boy, 6 years old, and the other is a girl, 4 years old I believe..)

Also got told that the my sister husband's is filling for child care... so that's pretty fucked. He even asked my mother how can he put the kids in school. 

The entire situation is a shit show...

Hopefully I can update you guys whenever I get I change to talk with my sister. 

Any ideas what I should do?

depression,"Panic Attacks and suicide The past two months have been the worst. Stress at work, and my sister moving out has been increasing my anxiety. I've had a panic attack the other night and now I'm completing suicide. 

All of my friends have moved on and is leaving me behind. Making progress, finding new jobs while I'm stuck where I am. My sister is all I have left and her moving out has me on the verge of tears and death. 

Nobody is going to read this anyway. All my shit on here gets ignored. Just wasting my time by venting."

depression,"I got good at pretending (24M) I pretend I’m good at spending money but every two weeks I’m broke with a maxed out credit card and almost empty bank account whether I had 1k to start with or 700. I pretend I take things in moderation but I’m a drug addict I love drugs. I pretend I work out but I only go to the gym twice the week and spend large amounts of money on food. I pretend I’m that guy I used to be, always wise cracking jokes to get by. But I know the truth. When I’m not high anymore. When no one is around. I know how much I hate myself. How much I deserve to suffer mentally. It hurts so much but feels relaxing in a way. This negativity is all I really have. I’ve tried forgiving myself and others but some mistakes, some mistakes I can never live down. I hate myself for what I’ve done. I’ll still move forward but this feeling, of a world where love is a scarcity, I despise it."
depression,"Can't believe I'm here again but yep. I'm still depressed and it's getting worse. Believe me when I say I am doing everything that I can to un-depress myself, but to no avail. 

Just today, I even tried to kill myself by taking a whole bottle of sleeping pills in the morning. Then, I went to work. OD didnt work- I just felt sleepy the whole day. Then, after work (5pm), I went home and just fell asleep and now it's 9pm and I just woke up feeling light headed. 

I was pretending to be in a good mood the whole day and no one noticed that I'm not fine. I don't blame them tho cause I don't want them to know.

And i am not talking shitty jobs, it's just me, finding no joy in it. Or reason. I have a debt in bank so even if i change job, it needs to provide me with enough income so i can pay my rent and the debt. The f*cking trap i get myself into when i was younger. I have no goals in my life. Since my childhood, i find everything interesting, for a while. Then i start being bored with it, then i start to hate it. I can do anything but nothing. I have no happiness in my life. I don't know how are people doing this, knowing what brings joy into their life and hold onto it. If you ask me what do i enjoy, i would not know. I never wanted to be anything. I enjoy nothing. I have a terrible feelings about myself. I used to forgot about them for a second by playing videogames or drinking alcohol...well, that doesn't work no more. Every other day is struggle for me. I considered ending this failure for once. But i have one person in my life i don't want to lose and it brings tears to my eyes even thinking what would my death do to her. She is for now only reason i am still alive.

depression,"being depressed with anxiety and ADHD makes my (21M) whole world spin Comorbidity is no joke. I've had it rough these past few days.

I get the products within but I ended up being just so hopeless and spiraling. 

Avoiding things led to more work, and now I'm paying the price today. At least I'm in a slightly better place than rock bottom-- but man it felt dark. Nothing was going to help.

Even when they are not. This is not even including people. Just everything. I want to isolate myself in a room. My body gets cold and uncomfortable. I start to feel ill. I feel cold and warm at the same time. My mindset is “what’s the point of this shit?”"
depression,"can depressive crisis become abuse? I'm asking this because it's what I'm going through right now. My therapist believes I am depressed, and I agree signs are indicating it (loss of interest in doing things, I don't care about work or things I used to, feeling numb or low all the time etc). I have a long term partner with what I believe is severe depression and anxiety. 

We go through crisises where I'm told he's completely done with this world, will do X if Y happens, very suicidal, etc. They usually precipitate from something bad happening in his life (in this case it was being told his contract wasn't being extended), and things spiral fast. 

My therapist told me this is abusive to me, which I'm having a really hard time reconciling. On one hand, I do feel trapped and terrified (I'm his reason to live), but on the other I don't think he's doing it to trap and terrify me, this is his mental illness and he really is seriously depressed. But then again he's not doing anything to actively work on his mental health (we just signed him up for a therapist but I am not optimistic it will stick until i see it for myself. I know it won't work if he's not doing it for the right reasons). 

I haven't been able to work or think straight since this last incident happened about a week ago, even though everything is ""resolved"" (the contract issue was a misunderstanding and everything is fine). I don't feel fine, I feel terrible. I can't tell if this is the right place to ask or not. Is it abuse when it's a mental illness crisis?"

depression,"Just venting I used to come on here and type sad things and depressing things when I lived with my mother. I hated it there. I remember trying to avoid convo when she found my Reddit. She seem like she cared i shouldn’t have avoided those convos. She died not too long after. I woke up and she was dead next to me from an overdose. I hated how my mother treated me but I wanted her to get better and be the mom I remember. Now I live with my dad without my brother barely getting up for school. Just got taken out due to someone I sat next to having COVID. Came back a week later all my grades are ruined. Last year was all digital and I’ve never had worse grades in my life. I should’ve told people how I felt about my mother. It hurt me so much because I was so conflicted. The first couple days were like it never happened now when I get a call from my brother crying about how much he misses her now and me I simply become so depressed. I cut ties with my crazy aunt who I will never talk to again, why would you try to say someone murdered my mother? I’m in class rn as I’m writing this.

depression,"Too many things piss me off in life and nothing makes me happy I wake up each morning dreading life in general, special occasions do not make me happy nor seeing my family. If this is all that life is, I don’t want to be a part of it. Nothing will ever make me truly happy and too many things make me angry. I hate college, work, talking to others, and having to put effort into things."
depression,"I keep on ruining everything I’m 20 years old, female, physically healthy. Grew up going to a private IB school, graduated with top marks, bilingual, and was on track to studying at a top course at an esteemed university. But I’ve ruined it and I’ve only got myself to blame. 

I’ve always managed to present well. While I struggled with self esteem and depression since I was about 10, most people who met me would describe me as a friendly optimistic kid. Always enthusiastic in class, not the most popular kid but friendly with everyone. At home I dealt with my bipolar mother (undiagnosed as she refuses any professional help but suspected). I’d go home, notice how quiet she was and immediately be on alert. Couldn’t be too quiet or she would get angry that I was walking on eggshells, but too talkative and she’d blow up. She would take any excuse to yell at me, call me ungrateful, a whore, ugly and stupid, that she regretted having me and that she would kill herself and haunt me after her death. This would go on until morning, where I would then run away to school and pretend nothing was going on at home. The next day she would apologise, and promise that she would never do it again.

I would get a temporary reprieve at my fathers house, where my dad, step-mom and half siblings lived. The fact that my father had remarried was kept a secret from my mother as he was scared of what she might do. The responsibility of hiding this fell to me. I had to take her calls outside where she wouldn’t be able to hear the kids,  and field questions about my dads relationship status.

I always promised myself to never be like my mother.  I knew it was an illness, on her good days, it felt like she was the only person who knew me and cared about me, but her bad days were a nightmare. She pushed away anyone who loved her and she  was self sabotaging, quitting jobs for petty reasons and thinking everyone was plotting against her.

I went to university overseas to get away from my mom. But then COVID came and I had to go back home. I didn’t cope with online classes well and hated what I was studying. I decided to apply to visual arts, my real passion, but my mother went berserk over this, her outburst escalating to threats against my life. To appease her I withdrew my application and took a half year off. 

I was going to apply to a different course back in July, when my mother found out about my dads family. The fallout from that was directed to me. It broke me I think. I contemplated committing suicide. I was just so tired of feeling like everything was my fault. I was a financial and mental burden on my father, as he didn’t want anything to do with my mother, and my mother had directly told me that she would’ve been happier had I not been born. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship, as I’ve always been scared of being emotionally honest with others. I didn’t really talk to friends about his because it wasn’t their problem. The only thing that held me back was my younger siblings. Despite being somewhat distant to them, they had grown to love me and I didn’t want to traumatize them. While this was all going on, I missed the deadline. At this point I just feel like a failure. A complete loser who’s contributing nothing to society, depressed and anxious with no social skills to boot. I pushed away my friends, who all assumed I was attending uni again, because I was ashamed and planning to die. I just hate that despite being  educated and coming from a privileged background, I have nothing to show for it. I’m so goddamn weak and pathetic and I loathe myself at this point.

As for why I’m writing all this, I guess I’m lonely. Some part of me doesn’t want to end it all yet, and so I’m writing to strangers on the internet to feel like someone is listening."
depression,A feeling I just feel like I’ve reached the end of my rope. I think somebody can only be beaten down enough times to where they just say fuck it and don’t get back up. I probably won’t do anything. I wish I could. I hate myself and my life so much that being dead seems a better option rn honestly..but I’ll take a few pills and maybe tomorrow when I wake up it will get better.
depression,"It's hard for me to do the things I need to do, especially when I make plans because I just feel tired or don't want to do it. I feel like if I got into the habit of leaving the house everyday, it would help but idk what to do. I don't want to run to a coffee shop because the only one close to me is a 5 min drive and I can't afford Starbucks everyday. I live in a urban area so everything I have to drive to and it's mostly chain restaurants/stores, company buildings and smoke shops.
 
I take my dog on a walk in the morning but I don't have to get ready for that, it's not really the same."
depression,"Stunted I feel so completely empty and feel guilty for it? I have a home (not everyone does). I eat even if it’s soup every night. But I have no accomplishments, no goals, no hobbies. I do not get excited about anything even “vacations” I feel so guilty to have these privileges and not even be happy or utilize them."
depression,"My life in almost every area feels like in shambles. What can I do?  31/M. Blessed with both anxiety and depression and on meds currently. Therapy didn't help much.

* I'm a burned-out freelance writer, wanting to quit this career and get into programming.
* Health-wise (Physical and mental) not doing too well.
* Have a very few friends and feel lonely even when I'm with them.
* Never been intimate or been in a relationship.
* And don't know who am I anymore.

I really feel life would feel better if I get in a relationship because I am yearning for romantic love and affection. But it is impossible (or very difficult) considering the place where I stay, covid restrictions, and I absolutely know no women. I'm not from a Western country so dating isn't a common thing in my town. It's more common in metro cities but I can't move there right now.

Fellow people of this sub, can you offer me any help to become better? While other things will take time, receiving love and affection would definitely change things."
depression,"[19/M] Need serious help/advice Ok so a bit of a backstory, I am a 19 year old male, Virgin, have Depression,OCD,ASD,GAD and never been in a real life relationship outside of a failed long distance one a few years ago. I currently don't really have any friends and I don't know where to pursue them and if I do make friends they always don't last very long because I always feel I screw up in conversation and I get jealous that they have a GF/BF or have/had a better childhood/life than I do/did.

&amp;#x200B;

I am scared I will never find a special person and when I get told I will I feel that is just wishful thinking that tries to get me to shut up about it. I don't know if I'm a Nice guy or something else I don't know but my depression about this has gotten so bad I have begun to snap at people I am friends with or people I see in person who are in a relationship with someone. If I could control this jealousy problem I would but I cant.

&amp;#x200B;

I also was bullied heavily about being a virgin (I think this contributed significantly to my troubles) and I am sick of being a virgin but I don't want to pay 200 bucks an hour for a prostitute. I don't see women has sex toys or possessions. women don't owe me anything. But I just need advice on how to talk to women properly. I fear rejection greatly but it's not that I am afraid of approaching girls/women (even though I only really do online on apps such as YUBO or SnapChat) the fear is my social awkwardness and I just don't know what to say without being seen as dry (My humour is dry and I struggle to come up with flirting lines) and my fear of rejection is just that bad I don't plan on asking anyone unless I know for sure they like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have issues but I just don't know where to start about fixing them. I need real advice what to do. My mindset on wanting a GF is obviously not going to change and as time passes the thoughts get worse and worse, Bad enough that I often get into panic attacks about it. I have tried seeing a psychologist but it doesn't seem to be helping so far and regardless I cannot get back in until November. 

I feel I have missed my teenage years experience of having sex and I am very jealous of people who had sex at a younger age than I am now. And it is costing me friendships.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit please give me some real advice. I'm really struggling."
depression,"i fucking hate pain  it hurts! it hurts so much! i love being human, even being me, but the pain!!!! im tired of being tired of feeling pain everyday! i want to say that i want to die but i don't want to die!!! my whole life feels like fucking casino where i only spend and never win so it's just like a gambling addiction. everything is fucked. i don't know what happiness is. what am i going for. what im trying to achieve? i've been hearing ""it will get better"" my whole life. im 21 now. did it get better? no. was my life worth it? definitely not. even if i will be ""happy"" for the rest of my life from now, id say it was not worth it. at least it feels like it. and it hurts."
depression,"I keep going through cycles of depression and I feel like a fake A little while ago I felt really down; couldn’t eat or sleep properly, constant numbness and despair, no motivation to get out of bed or look after myself, no motivation to do anything I would usually enjoy. But then I seemed to almost grow out of it, in a way. I found myself being happier again, more energetic. I was talking to friends, doing things I enjoyed, even taking care of myself. It was actually pretty nice.

But now I can feel myself slipping again. I thought things might have been getting a bit better but I can feel it coming back; the feelings and thoughts of hopelessness, numbness, the lack of motivation. I can’t keep doing this. Putting up a facade and pretending to everyone around me that I’m perfectly fine. I’m so sick of everyone being so positive. Everyone around me is talking about how amazing life is and how much fun their having, and all I can do is sit and watch while I suffer in silence."
depression,"I am in a dark place And no, it's not going to get any better. The road is too steep and I'm too much of a weakling and a coward to make any significant change to my life. 

I've been manipulated and abandoned by the person I loved the most.  
I feel trapped and isolated in a small town without a way to escape.  
I don't have a job and I'm agoraphobic.  
All my friends are either too far away, or uninterested.  
And my family is slowly breaking apart.

I have never felt so broken up and alone in my entire life. The only things keeping me alive are videogames, and the novel I wish I could write.

I have already written my last wishes.   
I don't know if I will ever commit.  
But from where I am right now, I can't see any other choice.

M, I wish I could hold you again.  
I truly do."
depression,"I had enough, i wish i could stop living. I actually love being alive, but all i have is misery and pain, I can't take this pain of loneliness, feelings of missing out on life and not being good enough anymore. 21 and already i cried enough. My eyes are painfully sick.

Looking back i feel mad at my parents, just only because of the bad parenting and criticisms i faced in childhood i am having this fragile mental health.
I hate this, there's too many people in this world, but why can't i find anyone. I live with my parents, they are too controlling and conservative, they wont let me do anything  with my life and i hate it. 
I'm 21 and a medical student, my college life sucks, I'm an introvert, i have no friends, and i have no fun in my life.
I think I'm not ugly but i was made to believe so, recently some people actually complimented me, untill then i always hated the way i look and i used to rub my eyes very hard when i cry because i didnt liked it, slowly i am getting blurred vision and soon i think it will progress to glaucoma, recently someone toĺd me how much they wished they had my brown sparkling eyes made me tear up, because i was taught all my life to hate it. i wish i could undo and go back to childhood and unhear all self hatred they injected into my young fragile mind.
To sum up i want to say, i am bloody nice person so i expect everyone to be nice towards me too, i dont know how to put my feelings before anyone, i was talking to this guy online and he was so self obsessed and was talking nothing but about his ex and how cute adorable she is.. i felt bad, we was there for a conversation and its supposed to be about common interests but all he want to talk about was about his ex gf. It made me feel even more lonely. And i didn't knew how to ask him to stop, so i just kept listening and complimenting."
depression,"Rupture Bonjour a tous.
Je m'exprime ici car je n'utilise pas beaucoup l'application, et qu'aucun de mes amis ne savent que je suis sur reddit.
Cela fait 3 semaines que ma copine m'a quitée, apres que j'ai appris qu'elle m'avait trompé avec un autre en vacances.
Depuis je me sent mal, mais ça allait, je fesais avec.
(Le truc est qu'on a vécu en ménage ensemble pendant 1 an)
Il y a deux jours, quand j'ai su qu'elle rentrait de vacances, je lui ai dit que j'allais passer lui rendre les clés, et il y avait quelques unes de mes affaires qui restaient dans l'appart.
On a discuté, mais h'avais l'impression qu'elle vivait une meilleure vie que la mienne, que finalement c'était moi le problème et depuis, je le vis très mal.
J'avais déjà fait des tentatives tout au long de ma vie, mais ces derniers mois, ceux la ont augmenter (5 tentatives en tout cet été) et la je suis a deux doigt d'en refaire une.
Ma famille commence a voir que je ne vais pas bien, mes amis aussi, je commence a me renfermer sur moi meme, a fixé le plafond dans ma chambre, a ne plus rien faire, etc ...
Je voudrais savoir si je dois aller consulter un psychologue car mentalement, je ne vais vraiment pas bien.
Merci d'avoir lu ce post"
depression,I won't be dying until july 2022 As cringe it sounds my fav band of all time coming to my country might be a reason i push one more year.
depression,"My existence is pointless Nobody really needs me around

Look at the worthless piece of shit that I am

Disgusting"
depression,"how to stop stalking my ex i broke up with my ex boyfriend a month ago and i have been extremely investigative since. ive always been one but after we broke up i saw him actively liking this one girl’s photos on instagram and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health. i will have this intense urge to harm myself each time i see his name on the girl’s profile. the thing is, ive watched this girl for nearly two years and it’s getting a lot more suspicious now. i need help, how do i stop this habit of stalking girls that he’s following on instagram, and harm myself everytime i see something that hurts me? i wont heal if this continues."
depression,"Just listen pleasd I’m new here and I don’t know what I’m doing. I said suicide for the first time out loud today and I started crying. I wouldn’t do it but saying it out loud just has a whole new feeling to it. My life’s out of control, I can’t do anything right, I’m worthless and all I do is hurt. My friends treat me like shit (I’m 18M) but I can’t leave them because I can’t be alone. I don’t know what to do and I don’t see it getting better. I’m so scared and I have no one left. Please help me"
depression,"I can't stand my restlessness. It's the worst for me. I learned to live with my depression and anxiety symptoms, in a weird way it's romantic to feel so down. Don't get me wrong, I suffer from it too but I also know it and it often feels familiar.



But


This dammed stupid restlessness is killing me. It's not a urge to move most of the time. As far as I know it's a giant stress symptom. I got 1000 guitar strings through my body and someone is picking on them arrhythmic and chaotic 24/7. Micro sparks of electricity going back and forth TWENTYFOURSEVEN everywhere in me. I have trouble getting into sleep.

Sport helps, Meditation helps, being with someone I love helps. But only for a very short time. after 1-2 hours it's there again full force.


Is anyone else feeling this way?"
depression,"forever alone The worst part about being forever alone is losing friends because they get GF’s and hang out with their friends. Sure I could ask to tag along as the 3rd-9th wheel but that’s not fun.

I can’t even imagine a girl being attracted to me, or even want to be around me. 

Idk I’ve been trying to get into the dr, but idk what it will even do. I’m a loser and a waste of space"
depression,"I am going through cold-turkey medication withdrawals for the 5th time this year. I keep self-sabotaging. I am 33yrs old. This is so utterly shameful. I am so tired of this endless battle with myself. It's been a year since my last suicide attempt and I am just so fucking exhausted. I feel like I should have my shit together by now. 

Takes meds on/off for months &gt; prescription runs out &gt; goes through withdrawal and spends weeks/months suffering &gt; eventually get's prescription renewed &gt; repeat

Same with therapy. No fucking consistency. I can't stick to shit. Every fucking thing I do leads back to square one.

I don't even know why I'm posting here. I'm only going to delete this post in an hour."
depression,i really thought i was doing betyer things were getting better. i was finally feeling okay. not really happy…but okay. for once it felt like i had some kind of future to look forward to. and yet i keep tripping up on small things that don’t even matter. why am i like this. i hate feeling this way. like i don’t even matter. like i’m just gonna die sooner or later. like any affection or love people show toward me is fake. i hate being vulnerable. i hate talking about my feelings. i don’t want to be hurt. but time and time again i get hurt. why? i feel really…small. like i’m not in control of my own life. this world is scary and intimidating and i don’t feel ready to enter it. i don’t see a future for me. and that’s scary. i wanna be happy. i really….really wanna be happy.
depression,"How do I go on I don’t have ties, I lost the love of my life when I came to she was toxic and left me but I want her back, I love you wherever you are. My “brothers” showed their split tongues so I cut them off. I have like 2 friends, and I never get to see them. The situation I’m in just keeps getting worse I’m so alone how do I pick myself up how do I love another when I can’t love myself how do i strive for progress if I don’t want to be alive"
depression,"my life It’s been about six years of going through depression. Currently at my lowest point of my life: 

I decided to go to my doctor to go seek medication. I can’t deal with it on my own anymore. I just can’t. 

I’ll update everyone if they care of which meds I was prescribed and it’s effects on me."
depression,"I wish I was good at something I  have been keeping my feelings to myself for a long time and I wanted to share it with someone. I am a 9th grade student  and I am trash.  I get bad grades, when I used to play sports I was bad at it too. I don't play any more  since I get bad grades that's why I have to cut out sports and study. I have no talent. I feel tired and sleepy most of the time. I am not good looking (it does not bother me much though) . I don't feel motivated to do anything and feel tired with life. 

I feel like all the people around me are in a race to be better than others. Sometimes I think ""why can't we all just exist peacefully? "" Everyone is chasing something in this materialistic world and there is always someone who has more than us 

I keep thinking about the past and I miss the old days

I did not make this post for attention or sympathy. I just wanted to talk to people who feel the same as I do. Pls don't judge. 
Thank you for reading this"
depression,"I'm scared I'm getting scared of my mind. Over the course of the last year, I got into an extremely abusive relationship, which sadly was my first and only ""serious"" one. I already had struggles with depression and self worth, along with violent thoughts, but it got worse. I finally left that bitch a few months ago, and I'm grateful for it, but my mental health hasn't improved. I contemplate ending it so frequently now. I always feel so angry, sad, and most of all fucking exhausted.  This last year has been nothing but pain. One thing after another. I feel bad for feeling like this, since I have a couple good friends and a good family, and the guilt just makes it worse. I want it all to end. I really really do, and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. I have an appointment scheduled for myself soon to get myself checked out, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. I just moved out of my parents house, and they moved out of town after, and my only two friends are normally busy, so I'm generally alone. I barely have the will to wake up in the morning anymore. Going to work is a herculean task. I have no patience, work ethic, or passion for anything. I try to force myself to feel these things, but I never works. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm scared"
depression,"I only suffer seeing others in pain. This damned world is evil,it forces us to live in a world full of pain and suffering with people who are struggling with disabilities, deadly illness, injuries, loss and much more. Depression is compensated suffering for the well of, it allows us to see this world as it truly is without the rose tinted glasses everyone else wears they are all IGNORANT depression isn't the illness happiness is! It makes us selfish to our own desires and ignore the needs of others depression allows us to feel others pain without actually doing so. THIS IS THE TRUTH, LIFE MAKES US HAPPY FOR NO REASON CUS IT DOESN'T WANT US TO KILL OURSELVES BUT THIS LIFE IS  A LIE, YOU CAN'T LEARN FROM HAPPINESS BUT YOU CAN LEARN FROM PAIN WITHOUT PAIN WE WOULD BE UNAWARE OF ILLNESS,SUFFERING, DEADLY INJURY AND PEOPLE WOULD BE DYING LEFT AND RIGHT WITHOUT US KNOWING!!. HAPPY PEOPLE ARE MENTALLY ILL CUS THEY LET THEIR IGNORANCE STOP THEM FROM FIXING PROBLEMS THEY AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF!!?."
depression,"Am I mental or something because I can’t do anything right.Or am I cursed. Or something ??? It took me a long time, but im now beginning to think im mentally ill or something. Ever since I was a kid, I was always scared of death (still am) and always panicked when ever i had pain anywhere in my body. I always thought I was dying. Has I got older in my early teens I realized I always struggled with talking to others and Had diffucult  time reading and learning anything in school. I mean, Im somewhat of a foreigner because I lived in pakistan from age 5 till 9 . But i still struggle to understand english reading or whatever im reading even today at age 22. Everything I do and want to do never works out. Im so bad at talking and communicating with people that the last time I had a friend was at the age of 15 i believe. Ever since then I lost all my abilities to have a conversation with anyone. Not only that, but Everytime I meet anyone, they look at me and say the most stupidest things for no reason. I mean im pretty short 5’3 and skinny 125lbs and not really good looking, im a male btw. But i mean its like they look at me and just want to run away. Other things like me starting college 4 years late, always involved in fights and never talk to my brothers, mom or my dad. Everything about me is weird. Im so tired of myself…. I had to post this because i was playing the guitar and i realized and Im so bad at playing it even after 8 years later. And thats kind of been my whole life , being so fucking dumb, pathetic, ugly and just so useless at everything. It feels like im cursed or something. And the funny thing is that ever since I was 5 I knew my life will be like this… its so weird. Like I knew I was going grow up ugly, short, dumb, loser, and hated by others and have the most worst life. Its like I lived this life before. I dont know wtf is wrong with me but i know i will always suck and thats just how my life is going to be . The way my life is, i feel like an elderly man , thats how sad my life is . I feel like an 75 year old man knowing that my life is about to be over and i will be lonely and ignored forever."
depression,"No matter how the well day or night goes: I just feel empty Making $600 last night and getting laid with virtually no effort, from a very pretty girl; made $400 tonight and met so many new people. Both of these nights should have me leaving grinning ear to ear, but I just feel empty inside. Nothing matters. 

The one girl I care about cut me off in a heart beat after I made one minuscule mistake. I haven’t had feelings for any girl in 4 years since my ex and I’ve “been with” about 12-15 girls since. Why am I constantly so dead and emotionless no matter how much i “win”. I just want to be loved and my life feels like it’s falling apart despite how “well” I’m doing financially and etc. I don’t care for comments trying to console me and make me feel better, thank you if you were going to but I just needed to vent and I’m sure I’ll delete this once I sober up. 

Take care friends, and here’s to legitimately happy times."
depression,"Sex life is dead. I’m 26 and married. Depression is really kicking my ass at the moment. I have absolutely no desire to have sex with my husband right now. Even when we have managed to have sex (maybe once the last month) I felt myself wanting to avoid intimacy and just made it a quick fuck.

Anyone else dealing with this? What can I do? 
It’s hard when you don’t want to have sex with your husband. I feel so guilty."
depression,"The rest of my life doesn't seem very appealing I'll have depression forever. I'll hate myself forever. I don't want to die even though I wish I was dead so I guess I'll just ride this shit out.

I'll just be living in apartments the rest of my life barely scraping by. I won't be successful, the idea I might is a lie I've long since stopped believing. I'll constantly be stressed and afraid of everything cause my fucking gad.

I'll keep fantasizing about if I was dead people realizing I really did need help and they should've took my seriously and stopped brushing me off. People only really care after you're dead, like those famous artists. It's manipulative thinking. I'm an asshole. I'm a bad person."
depression,"vent i dont know what to call this feeling its hard to describe. im so lonely and sad. my life is so meaningless its changed to this absolutely pathetic life. since ive moved I have no friends,my dad has changed my sisters too young, I dont even have a place to cry I feel dead. i did kind of talk to my sister about little things about our parents, we were in the car waiting for our dad talking for a hour and when he came into the car it was like a switch where we kind of pretend and as we were driving it got silent for a second, in that moment it felt like we both accepted that our life to 18 was going be sad and lonely, like its not going to get better, I wanted to cry in that moment or scream or idk do something but I couldn't."
depression,I really don’t want to advocate the use of drugs or risky behaviour but…. Look guys the world really needs good people like you. You have the ability to really make a positive difference here but do make it known neither I nor anyone else who has been in this community for years blames you for placing walking into the mysterious open arms of death. A lot of people here I see with good intentions and really want to do good and the boy thing I can say that has truly helped me is periodic drug abuse. I don’t want to encourage it but please consider it before suicide because for me and many others throughout history it has proved pivotal. Thank you and many blessings.
depression,"Forever on the fence [32f] Contemplating suicide yet again and holding back tears so i dont wake my children. This is so hard, how come no matter how much i try to better our lives i always end up fighting this thought of ending it when things get tough bc maybe they'll be better off without me. Our lives have been a struggle and this year was our year. I landed the job ive always wanted and finally was able to afford our very own place with my children finally having rooms to call their own, no more friends and family taking us in, and i planned to buy a house next year. All me, all for them, my children. Ive fallen behind financially and all seems hopeless now. Why is it when i take a step forward i then take ten steps back. This is so hard to bare. I dont want to fail them and i am."
depression,"I don't see a reason anymore I'm currently 18. I've been depressed since I was 12. I'm tired of everything, school is starting in a week and I'm just so sick of everything. I can't function normally and I'm not in a position to get any help because my parents don't think it's ""that bad."" I really don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I've been playing overwatch and valorant for 15 hours straight the past couple of weeks to distract me from anything but I just realised how fucking sad this is.

depression,"4 days still missing Tiger it's already 4 days when you went missing, nanay tried finding you too. She already circle around the whole neighborhood and still could not find you. Buddy my worst nightmare came true, someone stole you from me. Tiger, I still wish to die now more than ever. I hope your okay and well but everyone told me that you'll never come back or you're either killed by someone. Tiger, I miss you I'm so tired to move knowing youre not here. I just drowned myself to read so I could forget this pain but even reading is already cumbersome to me. I just hope I could live a day more until you somehow came home but I think it's pointless now because you'll never come back, I don't know who kidnap you. I just hope your safe and sound that's more reassuring to me but even that I don't know how you doing buddy."

depression,I wish someone would find me attractive I wish that someone could look at me and say that I'm genuinely attractive. All I've ever been told were either lies or that I'm ugly. I don't even think I would believe someone if they said I was attractive. I don't even find myself attractive.
depression,I just want to lay on another man's chest and listen to his heart beat and Breathing. Depression has made me so starved for attention.
depression,"I love alcohol SO much. When therapy isn't available, there's alcohol. When you're a loser with no friends, alcohol is your friend. When voices keep telling you to kill yourself,alcohol makes them go away.

depression,"I feel absolutely lost Sorry I dont know if this is the best sub to post this, but I just dont know what to do, I feel extremely lost.. Im 21 and I finished a marketing degree that im not sure I like. My mother died around a year ago and im not sure if im still processing It correctly I dont think about her all the time but when I do tears always come to my eyes. Im scared to get a job in marketing because I hated my curricular internship, I spend most days doing nothing, the only thing ive managed to do was go to the gym consistently, I used to draw a lot and I think I still like It now but im constantly scared of loosing my creativity and everytime I pick up a pencil I just loose all motivation, I enrolled on multimedia degree now, im not sure if I will like It or not im just tired of not doing anything and im scared to get a job. I worked in a restaurant for the weekends for a month and a half but I quit, felt like It wasnt worth It (hours I made, money I gained) I have some oportunities sometimes but im just out of motivation. I dont know if this fits here"
depression,"Is therapy supposed to feel this unhelpful? I’ve had a therapist for almost a year and the only thing I get out of it is venting. Even then it’s not even fully venting because I have to hold back. Every time I’m about to tell her something important she stops me and reminds me that she has to write up things like self harm, thoughts of suicide, problems at home, etc. I wanted a therapist because I wanted my family to finally believe me when I said I’m not healthy, but she always tells me it’s normal. Idk of she thinks it helps me feel better but it doesn’t it makes me feel like I’m faking it. I know the things I do aren’t healthy so why does she feel the need to say “everyone goes through that sometimes”, I just want someone to actually help. Talking never helps me and when she says stuff like that I feel belittled and it infuriates me."
depression,"I don’t want to take antidepressant Exactly ten years ago after first talk with psychiatrist she prescribed me a antidepressant because of my anxiety disorder. It was strange to me since she spent only about 10 mins talking with me and being pretty annoyed so it looked to me like she just want to get rid of me. At that time I thought I need someone to talk with and not medicine so I decided to not take it. Until today I had ups and downs but never felt really bad. Few days ago I decided again to talk with psychiatrist and again she prescribed me antidepressant. Again, I think I don’t need it and surely I’m not going to take it. Am I doing it wrong?"
depression,"[VENT] Everything is fucking shit [VENT]

I just got reminded of how exhausting school actually is. I can't live without it, cause it gives me purpose and forces me to have human interaction, but fuck does it take a lotta fucking effort to not stab myself every fucking moment of my miserable existence.

I get the biggest fucking panic attacks over basically nothing, and my mood just goes from extremely hyper and busting with energy and extremely loud and laughing about everything to fucking suicidal, self degrading thoughts and hitting myself with metal rulers and ripping my hair out while crying for no fucking reason. NONE. And i feel like fucking shit ALWAYS. ALL the fucking time, EVEN WHEN IM HYPER. 

Its so fucking exhausting having to push my body to the extreme limit of almost collapsing just because hearing my own heartbeat when I lie down is fucking triggering. It's so exhausting to feel like shit but the people around u thing ur fine because ur fucking smiling. 

I've talked to my mom about my feelings and how miserable I feel, but she just brushes it off.

 ""Depressed people don't smile, they just lay in bed and don't eat, and ur not like that. Don't exaggerate, honey""

I dream about my death everyday, whenever I bike to school I wonder how people would feel if I crashed into a car and died. I'm not gonna end it, I don't really plan on doing that anytime soon, so don't worry.

My first therapy session on this Tuesday, so that's nice I guess. Just kinda sad my mental state had to get to the point of automitilation and shit to finally get therapy. But I'm happy it's happening nonetheless, I actually wanna make it till then at least. Atleast try to get better. But I'm also really scared of what's gonna happen if it's not the solution, but I'll worry about that later I guess. 

Good luck on this journey&lt;3"
depression,"ED tendencies This past week, my depression has been paying me a visit, and along with it, it brought some ED tendencies. Some ED habits have unfortunately set in a bit as I've noticed I've been starving myself a bit and eating only one meal a day. And today, when I was eating, I felt like throwing up half-way through my meal. That's the first time I ever felt that way. I had to pause myself for several moments before I was able to force down the swallows.

When I wake up in the morning, that's when I think I look my ""smallest"". I'm not even a small woman. I'm fat. But during the mornings, my body looks a little less fat, I guess. And I like that. I'm the type of person who, once I eat or consume anything (even just drinking water), I bloat so much it makes me look even fatter and my stomach is so big. And I think I've been avoiding to eat so that I can maintain this ""smaller"" image of me.

I hate this. I hate that I do this to myself. I hate all of this. I hate it so much bc I'm being fatphobic af, and I don't want to be. Fat people and fatness are not bad, ugly, nor shameful, but it's so fucking hard to unlearn that shit. Why can't I get this shit through my head? Why can't I be better? I just feel so tired, fat, and weak. I woke up around 3am and now it's 6am. Idk, I just felt I needed to vent about this somewhere.. I'll try to go back to sleep now.."
depression,"Why is it that just after masturbating you feel so motivated? And hell, this feeling doesn't last very long!"
depression,"OH MY FUCKING GOD (rant) Holy fuck holy fuck holy fucking fuck. I would give anything to dig my hands into my head meat and rip my brains apart like a rabid zombie and just throw them the fuck away. I cant stop invisioning myself fucking wholey unaliving. Like watching a movie, but it's my face and I can't get dead enough. Car crash, 12 gauge, garage door bars, how many sleeping pills I need to take to not vomit the pain pills. The backs of my eyes are watching myself unalive in numerous ways while the front is pouring liquid down my face. I rather be manic than sit in the dark of my living room at 4 am rewatching the last theoretical moments of my existence on repeat. 

I threw up in the shower today cuz i thought that maybe I was already dead. I needed to check that something felt real without leaving a mark cuz my partner would see it. I am in fact unfortunately alive.

Did you know that there's a suicide clause in every life insurance policy. It's takes two to three years before you're able to kill yourself and still get the payout for your family. Exhausting...

God fucking damn it i would have painted the ceiling with my fucking brains by now if my partner hadn't ""lost"" the key to the gun lock... I just can't fucking handle the rapid cycling images of myself from a convenient top view explore all the ways I can traumatise my family... I want to mash my brain like YouTube slime where its contents bubble up between my fingers leaving an audible squish before they dramatically string long sticky strands as i pull my hands away. I want to mold a new one that isn't so god damn useless. I dont know how much longer I can go on dealing with this. It's inescapable madness and it's consuming me... All I've done for days is lay in bed and sob because every time. I close my eyes I die, or something is waiting there to torment me of all my past misgivings... The silence is unsettling, too unsettling. 

My sister in law hugged me too long and I broke down in her arms cuz the feeling of embrace made me feel undeserving... Im obviously meant to suffer... My head won't be quiet..."
depression,"I feel I am not a good person I am 21 years old. I have been bullied during childhood, misunderstandings and all. I have a friend here now, he is very good and caring. But at starting time, he didn't allow me touch his phone or college id. I simply asked him to show college id to see and give while travelling in the bus. He stood up and went standing. But didn't gave me to see his identity card. Instead asked to see my id card. This made me hurt. Another time, when we were walking to bus stop . I said him lets go to preferred bus . But he disliked it and went away alone. But he is a caring and good person. But this attitude makes me feel bad about him. From childhood onwards I'm just seeing disagreeing people. So this feels me  hatred about him. And he is a happy person, feels like I can't be happy and a good kind person like him. I feel worthless.

And I have thoughts opposite of my behavior. I get bad thoughts that my mom is not good. But actually she is good. And gets stressful thoughts. Daily I am getting some kind of different bad inhuman thoughts like if I abandon my family I will be alright. I'm a selfish guy like that. My mother is not good like that. I am fed up of this thoughts

Once I feel my friends want to start business. Once I feel they don't want to start. 
Because that makes me worthless.
I feel superior sometimes and sometimes inferior. I can't sleep properly. This friend I told calls me daily. I judge people easily .
I'm unable to forgive easily.

I feel fear that people who troubled me might get me in the future. And this causes more fear. 


I'll be there for those who trust me. But not for those who don't trust me. Sometimes I querell I accept. But never leave them. But who ones breaks my trust and uses me I don't forgive them

How can I overcome these please give me suggestion.

I feel like I'll be like this in my lifetime. What shall I do I need help

Thank you for reading in patience.

Another thing how can I become like this friend a good person. Why I'm Not a good person."
depression,"Why are relationships so complicated? I’m almost going to be 18 and I still haven’t even kissed someone. One of my best friends has sex with people all the time, I wish I could do that. It’s not even because I can’t get people to have sex with it’s because I’m demi sexual. If I don’t have a relationship with them beforehand (a good one) the thought of them touching me is disgusting. Idk what to do anymore cause I don’t want to be a virgin but to have sex would mean to find someone to have a relationship with and that is so hard when you’re a teenager, everyone just wants to fuck meaninglessly."
depression,"""Relationship doesn't fix your mental issues"" While this is partly true, relationship can have tremendous positive effect on one's depression.

Sex and closeness are studied to have numerous health benefits, both mental and physical, while loneliness has multiple negative ones. Loneliness slowly kills a person. 

Just something to keep in mind next time, when you say that ""relationship doesn't fix your mental issues"" to someone."
depression,"I hate this whole month First of all because it's my birthday, and i hate doing birthdays

Second, because its that ""suicidal prevention month"", and i seriously can't stand people right now

i'm the most suicidal and depresses than i've ever been

a lot of people said: ""i'm here if iu need, u can trust me and talk to me..."" and then ghosts tf out of you and they never give you an answer back

But then it's the whole month and people go to social media and say: ""This is the month of suicial prevention, don't kill yourself, seek help, you are loved and etc...""

Yeah my ass, you ignore us all year because you don't wanna deal with us depressed people and proceed to look cool and friendly on social media posting about suicidal prevention month?

Oh F you, i hate this month with all of my strength."
depression,"Useless piece of sh*t, is what I am Sounds naive, I know. But sometimes accepting the reality brings a sense of peace, ""pseudo-peace"" to be honest. I can get over the things I cannot have, or should not have. This year's birthday, I really thought of jumping off my apartment's rooftop, not because I could not drag this life any longer, and not because I expected a bit too much from everything, but the fact that deep down I know things are not gonna change or get better, but at the same time I know I can pull through it for the rest of my life, only that killing myself on my birthday would be ironic and save me some time from whatever there is. Obviously I am rational and I am aware of the consequences, hence I am able to write it up here. I cannot change who I am, I cannot be what others would want me to be, but I am tired of the way I am. Fuck this life. I never asked to be born in this miserable place. Will any soul ever get option to be born? Can a soul get an option to be born, knowing the conduit they are going to reside for a while? Knowing where the conduit will ever up?"
depression,"What do you do when you don’t wanna do anything? This question sounds dumb but i’m stuck on it and have nobody else to ask. 

What do you fo when you don’t wanna do anything? I have no passion for much of anything at all, barely any interests in relationships or pursuing more meaningful friendships. I’ve never been skilled or talented or anything and i’m pretty much alive because of other people.  

I’m sick of being told that it’ll get better. I’m sick of being told that i’ll find some sort of purpose and i’m sick of only continuing my life as not to destroy the lives of my family. Of course i love my family but they shouldn’t be my whole reason to exist. 

It’s not that i can’t be bothered to keep living but i’ll never be of worth to anything or anyone so i don’t see the point anymore. 

What do you guys do as you suffer through the motions?"
depression,"After two years, sudicial thoughts reentered my mind today. I've always never wanted to exist but rarely do I acknowledge my existence and thought about suidice. For a fleeting moment today, my mind had a sudicial thought and went through the practical and logical steps of carrying it out before I managed to suppress such ideas. 

Don't worry, I'm not sudicial nor am I entertaining suidice but I thought I wanted to record this and maybe hear if anyone can relate."
depression,"I felt like I needed to get this off my chest In May I graduated from highschool and I've felt as lost as I have been since I lost my brother to suicide in 2016. Over the past 5 years all I've done is tried to survive the rest of school and hopefully thought I'd be happier once I accomplished it. The only problem with it is that it's probably brought more light to how bad my mental health is and I feel ashamed of how I've neglected myself. The only good thing that's happened since I've graduated is that I've slowly gotten over my fear of driving that was caused by my father's stories from driving and more recently a friend that passed away in an accident earlier this year, but other than that I feel that everything has gotten worse. I've lost interest in the things I loved (Soccer, Rock Climbing, and Gaming), lost most of the few friendships I had likely due to how little I talk to people, and I have no clue what I want to do with my life at all. I have family friends coming into town this afternoon and I feel ashamed to even show my face after I've been up all night just crying in my room. In comparison to my brothers I feel like an absolute mess that has no real redeeming qualities. I don't know how I can turn my life around because it feels like I've done everything under the sun to try changing myself into a better person with a real purpose in life other than being a mediocre son."
depression,"Not sure how much more I can take I don’t even know why I am posting, I’m just so fed up and overwhelmed. Things just keep getting worse and I have no idea how to pick myself up AGAIN. I always imagined there would be breaks between these sorts of things. I’ve been swimming desperately to get out of this storm and I’m so tired."
depression,"Living in the past I had a really bad past as I’m sure many people here have had, and I’m not necessarily looking for pity nor am I putting shame on anyone who does. I’ve just accepted it and I’m in a position now where I truly feel like I can control my life. Just one thing constantly holds me down mentally and that’s the people I lost. And I’m not talking about careless high school friends that people complain about all the time… I’m talking people that felt like family. People that saved me from drowning in my own pain. My brother(not by blood) of whom I’ll use an an example changed my life and gave me new perspective. We did everything together. Met as seniors and did whatever the fuck we wanted. We became adults together, moved away from each other but still played video games almost every single day. Long story short a girl went after me that he was interested in and things just went haywire. I tried my best to save our friendship but the best we could do was stop talking to each other. Why would someone end a good friendship over something so stupid? So many good memories and it’s just lost. I only use this as an example of many. Why does it seem like people would end years of memories for something stupid it’s almost as if I valued the friendship more than them. But most of all it’s been a long time. Why can’t I let it go? Why do I spend nights crying over people that are long gone?"
depression,"need input hello all, i have been in and out of hospital so many times due to suicide attempts. but what i’m thinking of doing is taking a bunch of pills to overdose, but not to kill myself just cause serious damage as a form of self harm. if i do that, and call an ambulance on myself am i just doing it for attention? like is my experience not valid or anything if i do it? if i do it will i be just an attention seeker and will everyone hate me more than they already do? it’s just usual self harm isn’t working and i don’t really want to die right now."
depression,"Broken I’ve began to dissociate recently. I don’t even know what I enjoy anymore. Tried sad sons, couldn’t focus. Tried upbeat songs, got a headache. Tried music I like… can’t even sit through a 3 minute song without turning it off just as quick as I hit play.

In the last two days I’ve had one take out breakfast meal and a few chips. 

I wake up at midnight just be to awake
 whether the lights are on or off.

At this point I just want to spiral into oblivion as I have been repeatedly told how little anybody likes me. And the fact my phone can go days between messages and calls… I believe it.

My cries for help have gone ignored for so long that honestly I believe I am not worth saving.’"
depression,"Help with psychomotor retardation I've been struggling with depression for about 8 months now. The treatment I've had so far doesn't seem to be working very well, and I'm being tried on new dosages of the one medication that I've reactive positively to, while waiting for more intensive CBT treatment.

Recently I've started to encounter psychomotor retardation. I've been getting some form of it almost everyday, where I just seem to go into slow-motion.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what to do when it occurs? I've been trying to look it up online, but I only find articles explaining what it is, not giving advice on anything to try when it happens to improve things."

depression,"I got laid off yesterday and I feel like such a burden to my loved ones already. The small office I worked at lost a big contract that was keeping them afloat. They already let someone of 4 years go last week and yesterday they let me go too. I was told “it’s absolutely nothing personal, just economics.” I felt safe working there pandemic wise because of the size of the company and all but 2 people were vaccinated. I absolutely loved my coworkers, they made the job fun. I’m so upset I won’t be seeing them almost everyday more than anything. 

My boyfriend already makes more than double than I did and keeps telling me “not to worry about finances, we will get through this.” My parents told me they will “help me out financially as well.” The few friends I did tell offered support and one offered financial assistance too. I know I should feel nothing but grateful to them but I hate needing help. It isn’t a pride thing, I’ve always felt like a burden to everyone. I feel my existence is worthless and I don’t like the idea of people I love the most assisting me with their hard earned money. I’ve always done things myself not to bother others. I don’t know how to accept help because I feel I do not deserve it. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry."

depression,"What am I suffering from? I am feeling incredibly mood off today and this what happened. I am an asian so mind that.

First thing I got woke up by mom at fucking 5 am in morning and I slept at 12pm. She continued to come into my room use the bath room or search something in the closet at that time, even though I told her all my life don't make loud noises as I can't sleep and I literally irritates me a lot. But she just never listens and repeat this pattern and disturb my sleep every morning.

As for the bathroom we have 3 in the house, yet she likes the one I sleep. I get we have preferences, the least she could do is come in quietly when I am sensitive sleeper. She just pushes the door like she doesn't care everytime. 

Today I have meet-up with my classmates, after corona lock down we all are meeting each other after few months. Because of my mom, I was sleep deprived and felt so tired and had to miss that meet up.

I took a 1000₹ meet up from my parents, it is equal to 13$ something. Anyway for some reason I am feeling incredibly mood off and lonely, the fact to do is my old college friends have left for other places and all are busy and I am barely able to make new friends in new college due to no physical contact ever, it is just hard to make friends and I tried too.

Today I called one of my close friend of new college to ask if she wants to meet up for tomorrow, she didn't lift. Later messaged me she was sleeping, although it was 11pm. i said ok call me back when you freshen up.

Six hours have passed and she never called me back. Lot of times this happened. She never returns my calls and always make some kind of sad excuse and even If I assume she is speaking the truth, I am just tired of hearing it everytime, I say literally everytime these days.

Anyway I was feeling sad and wanted to make myself feel better, so I ordered some tasty dish online and told mom not to cook. Despite me telling her not to cook she cooked the food and told I was shameless and fat pig who always eats fastfood.

I rarely eat fastfood like 3 or 4 times a month. Now angry at me mom took back the 1000₹ she gave me just because I ordered food from outside. 

I told her I am feeling bored I was craving for something delicious and she is like if you want to eat my food get out of house and earn your own money or else bend yourself according to my rules.

Now some of you may suggest he move out and earn, you are a grown woman. Trust me I still have one year left to get a job and move out and as for part time jobs it is incredibly hard to find where I live and also my parents won't allow me to do that. They never give me 1$ as a pocket money. They say to me ask us money if you need, and when I ask, they tell what do you need it for and if I say just to buy snacks or a lipstick, they will be like you don't need it just be satisfied with what we give you.

I am not even asking for lot of money , I am just asking 10$ a month and I even help mom with household duties to be a good daughter, yet I feel controlled by them at every moment. And worst part is I am so sleep deprived because of them.

Right now I feel this void of loneliness and keeps telling me my life won't get better. 

I feel like I will never get a good job or a good partner and something tells me whomever will be partner will end up leaving me and I will never have good friends and just die literally doing nothing. I feel so ugly and yes don't tell me the pity words hey inside beauty matters and no you are not be positive. I for one know it matters to a little extent atleast.

I am just bad at making friends and I don't know what anymore to do to improve them. It feels like people actually don't quite like me, like you know one those people we just feel the very first you don't want to be their friend and even you don't the reason why. I feel like everyone thinks the same about me."
depression,"Draining, maybe Just sitting on my bed here doing nothing, feeling nothing, having no interest in anything. 

I looked back through my old picture albums and saw pictures of myself smiling, with a sense of hollowness in my eyes. Or just me being dead af. I feel sad for myself for being through this much.

Or maybe I'll shower, clean my room, eat, and just rest because that's what I deserve.

I'm not super upset about not getting work done, I'm just sick of the low mood and not having interest in shit

depression,"Im addicted to adult camsites and it’s starting to ruin my life It’s something I've been dealing with for a year now and I never thought I'd be hooked to something like this ever. It’s safe to say I've been addicted to porn for years now but I don’t think it was serious. Then again it has lead me up to this point. I was actually introduced to it by an acquaintance who tried to get me into some virtual camgirl. It wasn’t until 3 or 4 days later that I would visit that site. I met this girl who I obviously found attractive and tried everything to get her attention without buying anything but ultimately I caved in. I truly regret it.
But what really irritates me is what triggers me into visiting these sites frequently: loneliness.

I don’t have any friends besides one person. But I have this unrequited love thing going on with her so I try not to get too attached so I could get over her a little. Whenever I felt like saying something to her that I know I couldn't tell her I would login and tip just to vent or have a conversation with one of the models. Some of them would even reject me because they actually would rather perform than chat. It’s fucking embarrassing to admit that instead of ""getting off"" to them I'm more interested in chatting with them. I could talk to people I have something in common with literally for free and I'd rather waste $10 trying to talk to some of the most unenthusiastic people I've ever seen. Some were very nice but ultimately I'd be left with an empty feeling when I shut my laptop. 

But what really hurts (obviously) is my pockets. Damn near 75% of what I earn is wasted on these sites. Sometimes I would waste half of my check in less than one day of receiving it. There’s times when I'd go to work and starve having no food to eat over it. I just want to stop but I don’t know how. I'm tired of having to lie about why I'm always low on money. I’m tired of having these random people on my phone begging for money. I'd rather go back to my old life before all this if I could even remember what I did then. I feel weak and every attempt at trying to avoid it was brief. I don't know if getting this off my chest will be a real start but I'm tired of carrying this weight."

depression,"So, how attractive am I? I recently had a first date with someone and it wsd a catastrophe. He said ""you looked a lot better in the pictures"". Casually. Not as the first thing but just inbetween other things.

At first I thought I must have musunderstood but since he left the second date very suddenly and ghosted me afterwards I guess I was not good enough for him.

The pictures I send him were one normal selfie and another more professional one. In a sense, one of my greatest fears was always somezhing like this happening. I never thought of myself as good looking even though many of my friends claim otherwise.

What should I do now? I could admit that I am not as good looking as in the picture and use others or I can continue using it and risk that this happens again.

I will always know that I might look worse to them when we meet in person. But when I meet someone they always look better..."
depression,"Your efforts are seen and know that I’m proud you’re still with us Admitting to myself I have depression was one of the hardest things I had to do. I pushed myself to get better and seek therapy without telling anyone and I was super proud of myself. I thought I was getting better so why is it that I’m getting worse? I hate opening up to people cause it feels like either people don’t understand or they look at me weird. It’s not my fault these thoughts constantly run through my head. 

I’m glad I have supportive parents but I remember the moment I decided to open up to them about it they seemed horrified and hurt. When they ask me now if I still feel depressed I don’t have the heart to tell them that that’s not how it works. 

The only thing I got going for me rn is effort. I don’t have the motivation to do jack shit and I cry every morning bc I don’t feel like living but I force myself to do it everyday. I turn my brain off and force myself to eat, to socialize, to workout, to have fun. 

I guess at the end of this rant I just want to be seen for my efforts. Forcing myself to do things I kinda don’t want to do isn’t how I saw myself living life but it’s the one I got. I’m just trying my best, even if I’m so utterly exhausted."

depression,"Frustrated - Recurrent Brief Depression? I have experienced symptoms of depression on and off since age 12. My last 'real' (longer than 2 weeks) depressive episode was years ago now, but recently I have been experiencing fleeting symptoms which are just as severe, but will only last several days, never longer than 1 week. Does anyone else experience this?

Between these states, I feel really happy, present, and grateful for my positive mental health, which makes it all the more frustrating when it is torn away from me so frequently for absolutely no reason. 

Sometimes it feels like I don't even have control over the recovery, I just slip in and out if these frequent episodes without any control over them.

Can anyone relate?"
depression,"Do you feel like your overall appearance looks depressed as well? I take proper care of myself, I shower everyday, I brush my teeth, I shave, I wear clean clothes, I style my hair but no matter how much effort I do to look good I will look dull and depressed, like their is no life in me. I could be having a tan going on but my skin is pale and dull, my face lost it's sparkle, my eyes have no life in them. You could be thinking that it's just how I see myself but every time I go to the barber, (and I have been to a couple different onces) and I look in the mirror, I just see a ghost of myself. Same with pictures from a few years ago and now.

&amp;#x200B;

Even when I smile, I still doesn't look right. You can basically see the sadness from a mile away. Everything about my appearance is not the same anymore. I could be having a good day in terms of depression but there is no life or glow in my appearance. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I had talked about this with my girlfriend and she says that I have lost my glow a long time ago. She says that there are some moments that I do glow again but that's less than a day.

Every now and then I see someone on the streets or mall that kinda look the same like me. As in, they look dull, no sparkle etc, etc..

I wonder if some of you people here feel the same. Have you lost your glow? Not just in your mind but your overall appearance as well."

So yeah you work hard, you get a master degree in computer science.  You know that you know programming and you ace any test that companies throw at you.... yet everybody turns you down... all that work for what? 

I work as a recovery support worker in mental health just because i knew someone who could hire me, i had no experience and yet I do an amazing job with people that need help. So i am not an idiot or incompetent.

I am always scared of death and i don't want to ever die and maybe technology will find a way to transfer my conscience in a computer or something. 

But lately i don't mind dying and if it happens today i don't care and i just embrace it. I am okay with it now. At least all this struggle it will end. Because i struggled like hell to get where i am and i went through a lot of shit and experiences for nothing."

Very much needed right now. Thanks"
depression,"I hate people What is wrong with this world? Why is my generation so fucked up? 

Where is the love? 
Why is everything about sex? 
Why does everyone use so much drugs and alcohol? Why isn’t a party fun without it? Why does everyone have to be so fake? Why can’t anyone be themselves? 
Why is everything about money? 
Why do people throw their trash on the streets and think that it’s cool? 
Where is the respect for nature? 
Why do people think they are the ‘superior’ species?
Why does everyone want to fit in?
Why are we all under the pressure of social media and a ‘perfect’ life?
Why do we need all this luxury?
Why are there people eating almost 24/7 while other people are starving?
Why do people actually believe they will end up in heaven?! After living on this fucked up human planet called earth, ignorant of all problems humanity causes.
Why are people judged based on their productivity, money and clothing? Why aren’t they judged based on morals? 

And why the fuck do so many people ignore all these problems?!

I never fitted in, but now i believe this society caused me to be an outcast. 
A depressed outcast.

Now I, a person with a healthy mind, need to find myself some professional help. Shouldn’t that be the other way around?

I always wanted to change this world, but now i notice it cannot be saved.

Rip humanity"
depression,"I feel so lost Every since my ex and I broke up back in November I just feel so lost. Before we met I had a full on plan on what I was going to do for the next 5 years. But when I met her, I threw the plan away, blew threw my savings and start evolving my life around her. Now that we aren’t together the past couples months I just feel so lost. I tried so many things. I moved back to my home state out of my parents home because I was just so depressed knowing I was near my ex. And I was doing fine I felt good knowing I was away from her and the toxic environment. But I just kept telling myself “what now” and I never had an answer and it would leave me into a deep depression. I lived here for 6 months and I felt like I was accomplishing anything. So I recently moved back to my home town. Where I have actual friends. And it’s going fine but now I’m starting to ask myself again “so what now” and I’m slowly going back into the state of depression. It gets so bad that I start to question my self worth and is it even worth living. And whenever I get depressed I just think of my ex. Sometimes I get so angry and blame her for everything. But then I get sometimes get really sad and end up missing her. I know it’s not her fault at all and I know thinking about her is not healthy at all. Which is why I’m starting to be more social and outgoing. But when I get those moment where I’m alone in bed at night I just go crazy and my mind is everywhere. I just hope I can figure myself out. And find my own happiness. I just hope I can find myself."
depression,"how to think about future ugh idk what to do, school is starting soon and i am so not looking forward to it. i’m a senior now so i have to think ab college and start thinking ab my essay. 

how do i do that if i literally wanna kms everyday? i feel just so numb to everything and i haven’t felt anything in a while. i’ll watch some anime or play a game to forget about it all, but when i turn it off, the bad feelings come back, and i have no way to stop it.

i just feel like i’m living in the past, i always think about what i could have done better and when i think about the future i don’t see anything. i have no passion at all. i’m fuckin nervous for what i should do 

i’m so stressed but i feel like i can’t do anything about it.

depression,"Black hole I am falling into. I don't stop by here much, as of lately I have been slow falling into a black pit of my mind. I go though periods of months to years of calm and just okay enough. I always run into the point where I spiral down back to nothing. I am just tired of trying to win a always losing battle, and I can't even get help with out adding more to my stack of medical bills from my mental illness. I am not sure what I am looking for here, if anything. I really guess I want to vent in a place where some may relate but anyways, I hope everyone in this sub find resolve there looking for."
depression,Still missing my ex We broke up in April 2020. I got wrapped into my jobs party like atmosphere while she was at home alone waiting for me to come back home. We were engaged. We had a big fight one night and it carried into the next day and every bit of it was my fault. I tried relentlessly to get her to talk to me but she just ended up filing a restraining order against me. I’d do anything to have her back and she really was the only person I’ve ever met who loved me for me and it just hurts knowing she’s with another man and doesn’t feel anything for me anymore. I just keeping hanging on to the hope that I’ll see her one day or that she has a bad day at work and decides to come knock on my door. She works 5 Miles from where we were living so she’s always coming close. I keep telling myself that if we were meant to be together than we will end up together but I’m losing hope and that hope is what’s keeping me motivated to stay moving and not fall into my depressed suicide state of mind that I get into when I start thinking about all the things I should have and could have done and I start realizing how wrong I was and how lonely she must of been feeling. Idk I guess I just had to vent for a second. She even wanted to be able to show up to my job with her boyfriend when we went to court. I work as a snowboard instructor. Like if i saw her there at my job with another guy I would just sink into nothingness and puke all over myself.
depression,"Diagnosed with other disorders first now depression. 2months on nexito. Healing well Hi.
I was diagnosed with depression. It's been a journey. At first it was bipolar 2 then schizoaffective then I sort another opinion now it's depression. I'm on nexito. They've worked wonders.
I have issues with constant negativity. Thoughts moods n talking out loud maybe that's why they thought I have schizoaffective. Mostly negative experiences with my peers negative politics in the news.
But I'm working on it. Not looking for pity, just a community. I started listening to affirmations. Sleep hypnosis has worked wonders for my negativity. Thanks."

depression,I'm so fucking depressed. Not a second goes by when I don't think of killing myself I want to give up on life. I want to give up on it so badly. I can't focus on anything. I don't have the motivation to do anything. I can do nothing. It's like everything's always falling apart. I don't even have anyone to talk to and it hurts. It hurts so much. I'm so tired of crying all the time. I'm so so so heart broken. I don't know what to do anymore.
depression,"Nothing really matters.. *(Using a throwaway account because a few irls know my other one)*

Every time I picture my funeral, I only see my family of 3. All of them look relieved that I am finally gone, this burden who's just wasting the family money. With me gone, my parents would be able to get some nice stuff, my younger sister would go abroad for her higher education.

I don't see a point in living, I'm so tired of being the one who reaches out to people, reminds them to take care of themselves, tells them their great qualities. I just wish someone would tell me that they're proud of me, not because I am upset or they're feeling sympathetic but because they honestly feel that way. 

Maybe people don't reassure me because they're tired of me. 

I wish they realized that I hate myself even more.. I am **replaceable** and I know the second I'm gone things will go back normal. Nothing will change. The Sun will still rise from the east, rain will still make things wet and the world would go around. My impact as a person is so miniscule, no one would care if I go. 

I wish I could end things painlessly. Something not as scary as slashing my wrists and not something that might backfire like pills. I just don't think anyone would miss my worthless pile of existence."

depression,"Vent I’m giving up hope in myself. I mean part of me doesn’t want to be here anymore and I’m not sure if it’s because my life is stagnant at the moment. I don’t care about what could happen in the future for me, it doesn’t matter to me. I couldn’t care about getting better or making it far in life. I wish I wasn’t here but I don’t have a choice. I feel like I can’t leave because it’s selfish for me to leave everyone when they care so much about me, but I care so little about myself. I don’t understand how people could even care about me, it’s not like I help anyone or make anyone’s day better. I’m tired of living and people getting angry at me all the time or getting called ignorant because I don’t have the energy to give a response to anything. I’m tired of trying. I’m tired of seasonal depression wiping out all the energy in me and I lose hope because it’s a cycle that never ends.

depression,"I am not in control of my life anymore. All my teenage years I had been an anxious child with an idea that I am inferior to everyone. 

My father put his kids in a school/college way beyond his means so he was always in debt (which has now carried over to his kids). And me? Always without money or means like the other kids in my school/college. Obviously I felt inferior.

Through all that I learned myself and also learned to tackle my anxiety and depression during those years. I got a good job... not something I liked but it paid nice, more than what the other superior kids got... That put up me self esteem and I had been more confident than ever in my life. Money brought some confidence as I could actually do things I wanted and go out with people. It was easier to meet new people and do things with them, it made me a lot more outgoing which I absolutely loved. 


3 years has passed since then and now my father drank himself to a life threatening disease (liver cirrhosis) while having zero earnings in the past 10 years, without his own house and without any savings, constantly borrowing money from someone. His massive ego (which is without a reason because honestly he hasn't done much in his life, he still rides on the notion that he was once in a very high position some 30 years ago) doesn't help at all trying to calm things down

Obviously I and my sister had to pay for it but it's honestly too much... Insurance won't cover because it's self inflicted and the medication and treatment costs more than we both can afford.

I am now stuck in a job which I am starting to absolutely dispise because I could tolerate so much with the idea of learning and I can only switch to a similar job because that's what I have experience in.. I was trying to switch to a role where the work is what I like and even that did not work out.

I wanted to go for further studies (MBA) so I can move into a job which interests me, but education is expensive and I can't afford to be without an income now.

I am growing old and nowhere in my personal life as well (romantic, financial, professional)... everything has stopped because I need to put all my focus on earning the money and making sure my father lives for how many years he can properly.


When I got my job I finally felt I was in control of my life and I can plan it out. Now circumstances have put me in a place where I am bound to do something I do not like because people are dependent on me... I have to deal with things some 30-40 year old has to when I am just 25. 


A lot of these things won't matter in a long term... but seeing my friends and contacts do what they like because they were lucky to be born in families which are not dependent on them.... it just hurts..


Every day I start my job looking into the abyss because I truly can't give 100% of my focus anymore on something that I do not like...


I am going back to the viscious circle of anxiety and depression every now and then and it's again affecting my personal life and my esteem. I have had thoughts is ""giving up"" which disgusted me as I never had that in my entire life.... but I knew i was stronger than that.


I just hope that I get through this and come out stronger than ever having defeated all of my worries and insecurities."
depression,"Losing hope Hello, I’m Thomas..
My name is one of the very few things I still know about myself. To keep things shortish I won’t go through my whole childhood. Ever since middle school I’ve dealt with severe anxiety, which soon or later also lead to severe depression. The only thing that got me through these times and kept a smile on my face were video games. I’m 25 years old now and will be 26 in two months time, I have absolutely nothing going for me and it KILLS me. After high school I was drafted to a junior hockey team where I played for a year, nothing really came of it. During this time, on one of our breaks I came home to see my family. Everything seemed normal until one day I walked into my garage to find my mom in a running vehicle with the garage door shut and yelled for my dad, thankfully we were able to get her out of the vehicle and to the hospital. This is just one moment in my life where I believe my brain chemistry just changed FOREVER. I’ve lost my ability to trust anyone or get too close to anyone because of this incident and a few others that I feel don’t need to be mentioned. I’ve never really been close to my family or my extended family because my parents always had an issue with EVERYONE. I also lost literally every single one of my friends that I knew for years because of my anxiety and the fact that they all had things going for them and I have nothing going for me, so that made it hard to face them, I felt like a failure. I became comfortable with people I’ve met online, I considered and still consider them some of the best people I’ve ever met. Going back, after my season in Dallas ended I came home and went to a community college online for two years, due to my anxiety problems I simply couldn’t gain the courage to go to class in person. Being that the classes were online, this basically meant I was still gaming all of the time. Fast forward to now, I’ve had probably 5 or 6 jobs that I can never hold for more than 3 months. I feel like such a loser, I have no job currently, crippling anxiety and depression, no credit score, I don’t pay any of my bills, I just do not know what to do anymore. I’ve been in and out of counseling and I can’t go back on medication because I won’t be under my parents insurance anymore soon. I feel like time has caught up to me and my only way out of this pain is to just end it. I stay up until 5-6am just thinking of how I can turn my life around and I can’t think of a reasonable path. Thinking of going back to work even makes me anxious, it’s that bad. The worst part is my parents just think I’m lazy, but I’m not. It’s the opposite, I want a normal life where I can go to work and feel like I’ve contributed to society, but my mental issues have quite literally never allowed me to work without being overwhelmed and most of the times walking out of some jobs even on day one during training. I just don’t know anymore.. my laptop and pc were taken from me, as sad as that sounds at 25 years old. Those were my outlet where I felt at peace and had people to talk to for the last 10 years. It’s been two weeks since I’ve had those taken from me and I just feel like there’s just nothing left to live for anymore. The last two weeks I’ve laid in my room with only my phone all day to avoid my family until they go to bed, then I get up and eat something. I can’t believe I am where I am, I used to be fit, motivated, and had friends. I’m just so lost and alone."
depression,"I've had to move back home with my parents due to a mental breakdown I had last year... I'm severely depressed and having regular suicidal thoughts. I moved home with my parents because my Mum was worried about me and I needed support, and I've been working from their home for the last 10 months. 

But last night my Dad made a comment about him ""keeping me"" (that's a joke, given I pay my way) and ""when was I going to get my act together because I'm being a drain on them both"". It made me feel like shit and vocalised my fear that I'm just a liability to everyone. And whilst my Mum tried to assure me that she does not share his opinion, the damage was already done. 

Do you know what, Dad - fuck you. I'm hanging on by a thread here and having a really shite time. Do you think I've moved home for the fun of it? Do you think I enjoy living with my parents again at my age? Fuck. You."
depression,Can you have depression without feeling sad? I have been questioning if I have depression but I haven't really felt sad about anything but I feel like I'm in a slump. I also have ADHD but I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Does anyone happen to know? Thank you
depression,i hate this life this life means nothing to me
depression,"How do I take care of a dog if I cant take care of myself? Next year im going to college and my parents had said if I'm going to be going away theyre going to get me a big dog like a pitbull or a german shepherd to protect me and as much as I love dogs and I like this idea, I dont think I want a dog yet.

My depression gets horrible randomly or sometimes when the slightest inconvenience happens, and then its impossible for me to take care of myself let alone a dog. Not to mention my bouts of anger during my depressive episodes can get aggressive and while I probably wont hit my dog, I dont want to scare my dog or accidentally throw something that hits them unintentionally. I just dont know if I'd be able to care for a dog properly. I dont think I can talk my parents out of this unfortunately, and making money to afford therapy as a college student is iffy. I think if anything my best bet would be giving the dog away if I really cant take care of them but thats not fair to my parents or the dog...

I know some of you have dogs, so how do you handle your depression while also taking care of your dog? Does it help having your dog around? Is it not as much of a problem as you thought it'd be?"
depression,"I absolutely fucking hate my life I have had 0 friends, acquaintances, or even casually pleasant coworkers for the past 3 years and it is driving me absolutely insane My family doesn't really talk to me either. I have become so detatched from social interaction that I can barely keep it together when interacting with strangers (not that I put myself in that position if I can help it). It's like my social muscles are atrophied. All I ever do is sit and reminisce about my youth when I had plenty of good friends and we all got together and had tons of fun all the time. The present isn't even worth living in anymore, my favorite activity is to sleep and dream the same few fully coherent memories I've retained from the past over and over and over and over. It feels like I die when I wake up, and I just live every day in limbo. Id love so dearly to be able to enjoy my life, but I'm slipping more and more every day."
depression,"i’m unhappy with who i am i am a lazy , non motivated person who’s awful with money and constantly see others my age doing so well for themselves. I feel like all i want to do in life is sleep. I don’t see myself succeeding in life because of my lack of motivation and that destroys me mentally. How did some of you get out of the lazy non interested mindset"
depression,"I don’t know what to do I’ve been battling depression since I broke up with my first wife almost 10 years ago. It was an emotionally abusive relationship, which I didn’t see the full extent of until I was out of the relationship and it hit me like a wall.

I’ve been on medication on two occasions since, each time feeling that I’m better and coming off the tablets. Obviously I wasn’t ready.

My current wife is an amazing, patient and kind person. We have had a wonderful little boy together (as well as our step kids) and I love her so much, but years of my mental health effecting her has taken its toll and she has finally had enough.  She wants me to move out, but I can’t right now so me are converting the garage as a place for me to give her space.

Yesterday was hard. She has been trying to make me see that we are over, but I’ve been telling her that I want to get better (or at least not have my mental health effect the household) and that I will try to give her space, improve myself and see if we can then move on. Two days ago she told me that she has no love left for me whatsoever and that there is no hope. It dove me deep into a depressive state. I couldn’t get up, let alone go to work. I felt suicidal. I still kind of do but won’t follow through because of the kids.

Her response was to phone the crisis line to get me help. I told her that I appreciate her helping, but I can tell that I’m just stressing her out and being a nuisance.  I agreed to see a doctor and (for the first time) have therapy too.

I want to get better and be the husband and father that my family deserve, but I don’t see a future right now. If I lose my wife, I just don’t see the point in anything.

I feel likei need to make things right, but she isnt interested. I feel like I need to work to earn money, but I just can’t face it while I feel like this, which in turn will make me seem less appealing to her. I feel like I need to prove that I’m a decent person, but like this I’m not.  I’m just a waste of time and effort. A middle aged man with nothing accept a family that I’ve lost. I just don’t see any point in anything anymore. I hate myself and the life I’ve made.  All because of my abusive ex, still ruining my life when she’s moved on to her next victim, living a happy life while I’m stuck her, destined to be alone and unhappy.  I honestly wish that I won’t  wake up one morning.  That way I haven’t abandoned anyone and  they can move on without me."
depression,"Life, pain, loss, sadness, realization, loneliness, surreal, consciousness I wish I could go back to being a kid and start all this over. I could make my friends and family happy to be around me. I feel disconnected and hurt, reality seems dreamlike. Everyone is awake and I’m dreaming, I know they think somethings happened to me since I’ve had to struggle so much recently and it’s really put me to sleep. Can’t really show myself anymore."
depression,It's no sign of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick system Always remember that. It's the latestage capitalistic system we live in that makes people depressed. Fuck wageslavery.
depression,"Please someone give me a coping mechanism which isn't alcohol. Seriously, that stuff is fucking toxic (literally, it is just slow acting poison). I ended up screaming at the top my lungs in public and making a big scene at my share house which has fucked me over, more than I already am.

Coping mechanisms, please?"
depression,"I get insanely depressed when i hear certain words, sometimes they're echoing in my head It might sound like a ""wannabe outlaw kid"" ish problem, but i just want to stop getting depressed when I hear certain words. ""(anything related to) normal, future, past, my own name, drool, dream, reality, hopeless, gossip"" are just a brief explanation. Whenever these words haphazardly comes to my mind, I can't stop thinking thoroughly. No matter what I'm doing, I reluctantly stop doing it and also reluctantly start 30 min-1 hour long of imagining session. When it happens, I mostly see these images in my head. 

When I hear the word ""normal"", I see myself in a looney bin. Only some of the people there has their looney tshirts untied. I'm not there, but I can see the room.

future:I can only see a suicide attempt by rope hanging. Most of the time, there's a written letter, but it's nowhere to be found.

past:Actually, I can't see an image on this one. No words going through my mind. Even though it's pure silence, I DEEPLY feel the guilt and self-hatred inside my left chest and upper back of my head. There isn't a thorough way that I'm capable of explaining it.

my own name:I always hated my name. I was unnecessarily way too obsessed with how the meaning never fit me. The name meant ""proud, honorary, never lies and shit"", meanwhile I'm a slacker, marabout who's all bullshit and lies.

the rest doesn't have much of an image, but even coming across those words, let alone hearing them, makes me uncomfortable enough to go to my bed. 

I stopped going to psychologist 4 months ago(after 7 years/weekly therapies),since I cut my ties with my father. The clinic was the cheapest, but my mom is pretty much broke. Got no friends, a family that constantly tries to make me give up on things that made me feel a bit alive, and they did it in a way that I won't even feel the same even if I wanted to do those stuff again. Got like 2$ in my back pocket. I just don't understand how a weak-willed person like me just lives on.
Sorry for the mess, reddit was the only place I could write these stuff."
depression,what the fuck is up with my life why am i so fucking lonely? i haven't seen anyone but my immediate family for about 16 and a half months now. i hate being in my room all the time. it's driving me crazy. can't even go outside because i shifted to a new city in the middle of the pandemic and my country is one of the worst hit countries. i hate my family. they drive me crazy. i hate online school. why can't i have one fucking happy day what have i done wrong. can't seem to die either.
depression,"How do i tell my mom the reasons for why i have lost all my confidence. So a bit of background, i turned 17 last month and am an immigrant from india. When i was small or perhaps only until a couple years ago, i was easy going, fun to be around, optimistic. etc those are just some of the things my family and friends would use to describe me. But now i can barely hold a conversation together, have lost all my confidence to go anywhere at all be it store, gym, bank,trying to make friends in school or simply put anything at all, i can't do anymore. I have lost contact with all of my friends , in india and from the USA, and have been extremely lonely and alone ever since we (me and my family) moved together here in the US 4 years ago. The reason for this extreme downfall... well there are many actually . Some of those started right when i was born and others, only when i came here in the US. So you see i have been born with extremely weak immune system and have spent a lot of my early childhood in hospitals and waiting lines to get to hospitals (oh and FYI i was in india till 13, so this whole part is in india) and in the times i wasn't in the hospital i was with my friends, getting bullied and discriminated because of my weak immune system . Even though i mostly got used to this sort of discrimination very earlier on, it actually left a lasting impact on my health, i think because of this and some other things my family had to go through when i was a kid,i actually developed insomnia and mild depression very earlier on and it has kept like that ever since. Now i can tell you all day how much i hated my friends that bullied me but they weren't the only problem then and they aren't the only problem now. So you see as i got older my health started getting better and i became an overachiever, as in always getting A+ always the leader of class, always the head student etc. You see this, overachiever as yo say put me in a cage made by my family , they would treat me differently if i wasn't able to live up to their expectations, they would constantly micromanage me because they saw me as a trophy , a trophy to show off to other people of what a great student and son should be like all while being completely blind to their son's struggle and problems and bullying that he would often face. They would constantly remind me of my imperfectance and tell me to fix it because obviously trophies can't be dented otherwise they aren't worth showing off. I started developing hate towards my parents but did my best to never show it, to simply let them live in their delusioned reality of their son loving them , for his parents trying to use him as way to feel less guilty about their parenthood. Now all of this i got through almost completely fine because of my grandparents, both from the very  start have always been there for me. They have always loved me unconditionally, never expected anything from me. They have always been there to pick me up whenever i fell and always been my best friend so i never feel lonely. They are the only 2 people i have felt parental love with, the kind of love that i never felt from my own parents ever. In 5th grade my aggi (grandma in marathi) passed way. It felt like half of me had been taken away and lost forever. For the entirety of 5th grade and a bit of 6th grade i felt so depressed and almost killed myself in some swimming lessons. But eventually i got through it because of my of my grandpa who was in an even greater pain than me , and if i had to guess one person who definitely lived a life much worse than mine, it would be my grandpa . Even tho he lived through such miserable time , he was always smiling ,being happy ,almost impossibly so . I guess he was always hiding his sadness by constantly intaking happiness and constantly just pretending to be happy. But that pretend certainly worked , if you had just met him without knowing who he is you could have never guessed the kind of life he lived. But just 2 years after grandma died , i find out that we are going to the US leaving my grandpa behind completely alone all by himself, i was shocked with this news, fearing for my grandpa and for myself . But i had no saying in what we did, i had no choice but to agree to leave my grandpa behind forever. Now coming to the us i was completely unprepared for the kind of bullying that happens here. The kind of bullying that would destroy me defeat me until i can't stand anymore. One day in 8th grade in the us, i was in the cafeteria line to get food ,minding my own business , outta nowhere suddenly this kid who's a bit shorter than me cuts line right infront of me so i confront him  and right of the back he starts speaking so aggresively loudly, so i start speaking loudly too but then we agree to let him be infront of me, and i think that's the end of that. Boy was i wrong. A couple days later in the library we accidently meet each other but this time he's with his gang. He starts the converation with i think i met one of yall( saying one of yall because because i was with my twin brother) and then i say ,no i don't think so  and then he say nahh, you that bitch in cafeteria . Then his big brother who physically js much bigger than him but age wise, probably one or 2 years older, starts speaking and says you got a problem with my bro, lets settle this outside the library now , now after this i try my hardest to peacefully resolve this just let him walk away and not get me killed. And i do thankfully because my speech skills were superb back then but i do get hit in the knee once, but its nothing too much i guess. Now even though after this physically i was mostly fine, mentally was terrified and paralyzed. I never once in my life thought that if i m being careless and happen to stumble across a maniac who doesn't have self control i can easily get killed. This thought seemed so crazy to even think about yet this was the reality i was living in. That encounter silenced me for that entire grade, for all the remaining entirety of 8th grade i was completely silent , almost invisible, only speaking when spoken to by the teacher. And yet despite that just that year so many bullies came that abused me physically and mentally, scarring me for life. Now the horrors of 8th grade finally passed and i was ready for high school , this time i made a rule for myself , to be as invisible as possible. Which sorta of worked actually, i was almost completely bully proof the entire year and even made 2 or 3 friends over time. But in 10 th grade, i got too confident about myself and well..., disaster struck , i was living through the horrors of 8th grade again. After getting through that torturous year of being bloodied a couple times in school backyard , being threatened by a real fucking gun once and being verbally abused by groups of people many times i finally got through it. And then covid happened, i can't tell you how fucking happy i felt when it happened because now for the entirety of 11th grade i did not have to go to school , i could not have possibly asked for a better gift. Oh and if you are wondering how i got through all there horrofying years, its coz of porn and video games , i know its a bit embarrasing to admit and probably inappropriate for me since i am underage but its the truth and i have to admit it at one point or another if i wanna have any hopes of a better life. This covid time was the loneliest time of my life but i almost started feeling happy again simply because i started feeling safe again . Its very possible that it covid hadn't happened i could have died from suicide or by someone else. Now to the main question at hand, yesterday my mom asked me why have you lost all of your confidence . What am i exactly am i supposed to say to that, that you are part of the reason mom, that tour cage of perfection left me feeling completly lonely and isolated, mom. That the massive amounts of bullying is part of the reason and the depresssion and insomnia i've had since forever is also part of the reason and the lack of parental love and emotional support is also part of the reason mom. Am i truly supposed to say all of this or do i simply not answer her question and let her forget it. Maybe i should just wait until i am 18 and run away from this house and start a new life and accomplish something more than just happiness because truthfully i've pretty much already accomplished happiness, yes ironic coming from me posting on depression subreddit. But i've found a very sad way to overcome sadness , you see my struggle for beauty is kinda sorta paying off because if can look beautiful i can feel narcissistic about myself , which means i can start to feel less sad while being lonely and more happy instead because i'll be too full of myself to care about other people. Or atleast that's what my logic is , it does seem to work rn since my struggles for beauty are sorta of paying off aswell. Which means checkmate depression , i can feel completely happy just being with myself all while being completly isolated from , given that in the future if i look beautiful and perhaps then accomplish something more than just happiness.

depression,"How do I stop overthinking and creating horrible scenarios in my mind ? Hi, I'm an overthinker, I just think way too much about something, and my anxiety clearly doesn't help. And I also create scenarios my head, I have really vivid dreams about a lot of things, either seing my family getting killed in front of my eyes, or simply just creating scenarios including my ex or traumatic things for me. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety since I can remember, so this is probably affecting."
depression,"Yesterday night I got beaten up in one of the safest cities on earth I just need to vent and write this down. I feel really really anxious right now and I don't know what to do about it.

Yesterday I was drunk and looking for drugs dealers and one of them beat me up pretty heavily and stole my wallet and all of my money. I was tricked and humiliated. One of them palyed the ""nice guy"" until the ""bad guy"" came and dragged me to a dark corner and punshed me several times in the face. Then they ran away. Immediately afterwards I filed a police report at 3am. 

I never thought that getting beaten up would cripple me emotionally. I am extremely anxious, I m scared to tell that anybody because I feel like it was my fault (drunken and looking for drugs). I was tricked and in hindsight I should have noticed the warnings. The physical pain is nothing compared to the emotional pain. 

I don't know what to do. I just can hope that time will heal my wounds..... I need a friend right now and I don't have one. I am crying as I write this."
depression,"Rumours I'm with who you think I'm with.

depression,"I'm envious of people who are depressed because of something It feels so much like I'm just attention-seeking. My depression went untreated for almost 4 years, because... Why would I be depressed? There was nothing wrong with my life. I was going to middle school, learning pretty well, having a lot of friends. Needless to say it's all gone now. I'm now almost 20 and I've been depressed for 6 years. These years have ruined me. I'm a different person now. I'm supposed to be an adult, but I barely take care of myself. I have no friends. Routines, like university or jobs, scare me senseless. I feel I will never be normal again. And all of this... For no reason. Just, at some point, at 14 years of age, I became broken. I was tired every day. I didn't feel good anymore. And so many people told me it's not real depression. That I'm just growing up. That it's just my personality, because I was always so whiny. That it's impossible to get help. That someone's sister went to a psychiatrist and they denied her medication. That I will never get better. Because... There is nothing to fix. I'm normal. Nothing happened to me. During the worst time of my life, when I was self harming and planning suicide, nobody noticed me. Because why would they? I had good grades, I was just weird for crying every day during classes. There are people who are homeless. Who got their lives ruined. Who got kicked out of their family. Who had their significant other die. Who got their hearts broken. Who watched their children perish to cancer. Who miscarried. Who got assaulted. Who got scammed out of everything. Who are jobless, almost to get evicted and who don't have family to fall back on. Who are complitely alone. There are so many people in such deep pain. And I dare to be depressed? It feels like I'm just pretending. My mother had depression for a period of time, because her husband divorced her and lied about her to everyone so she almost lost all of her support, and she was about to have her children taken away. My father had depression for a period of time, because he had to see horrors on the job, had to look at broken homes, murdered people and still be efficient. My brother had depression for a period of time, because his parents were getting divorced, and he was lied to so much that he hated his own mother, he was then faced with his father mistresting him and then was bullied for years.
And I'm just... Depressed. For years. For no reason. How dare I?"
depression,"Sertraline Has Helped Massively I'm on about week 7 of sertraline now and I can honestly say it has worked wonders. I'm 22 and 23 in a few days, i have been depressed starting from like the age of 13, 14, struggled with anxiety too and a bunch of other things that turned out to be adhd which i was diagnosed with in January. I tried the 3 main types of adhd medication including both types of stimulant, to no avail. When i was on the stimulants i was out of work, not in a routine and depressed, my mood was so up and down but mostly down. I stopped taking them as they were having no effect and decided to try anti-depressants for a while. And oh boy have they helped. So at first i felt no different and maybe a bit more suicidal in the first 2 weeks or so but by tye 4th week i could tell the difference, and now in week 7 I feel good for once. I never have the super low lows i used to, i do have low mood sometimes but not as often. Week 3 to 6 i felt pretty numb, not bad, but also not good. But this week has been good so far i have a lot more energy to do things i feel like. I have started going to the gym again 3 weeks ago and am enjoying it again like i used to. If i forget to take my medication for a day,by the end of the day I can tell. So I'm not totally fixed yet, but I finally have some progress.

I have far less negative thoughts. I used to have intrusive thoughts that were almost obsessive as well. It was always a downward spiral, like thinking about my girlfriends rape or other things that really upset me. I'm I finally have sorted out my room after years, and actually enjoyed doing it. As i have adhd i still get hyperfixated on stuff and obsessive thoughts, but recently it has been about decorating my room and finding new furniture i like for it.

Idk it was tough, I'd feel bad even when nothing was wrong, i coudl think about nothing but just feel bad like there was some negative energy possessing my brain. But i don't have that anymore.

Also having sex and things with my girlfriend has been a lot better in some ways. I feel a lot more sensitive down there and get stronger sensations which is great. The downside is I am finding it hard to climax and have only managed to by myself a couple of times in the last 4 weeks.

The adhd issues still bother me and upset me sometimes, but i think it would be good to try the stimulants again in the future when my mood is more stable, and I'm in a position where it is only the adhd symptoms affecting me"

depression,"sinking back into a bad place idk where to start, ive been stressed and depressed ever since i started this new job in the beginning of july. my sleep is terrible, i rarely get good sleep at all in workdays and on days off i sleep during the day. before i started work, id be working out consistently and i lost motivation because of my schedule. because of no sleep and work, i feel like i barely eat and feel malnourished. i feel like i lost all the progress i gained from working out. i also feel ugly. whether its my body or face. and i was starting to feel a little confident too. i feel like im not at my best. i miss how me and this girl used to talk. i applied to school and now i have to follow through and im not sure how im gonna balance all of this out. it wasnt even that bad but my breaking point was a few days ago when i had a rude customer say some dumb shit. i told a coworker about it and we kinda laughed it off, then i told another coworker who i thought would be cool but then he sided with him and that ruined me. i didnt even mind the customer until that. exactly last year around this time, i had the worst time of my life for a few months because of depression and anxiety issues, and i feel like im reliving it. i was doing good before this job. im starting to even feel nostalgic for the time i had before work when i was just chilling doing nothing at home but i dont wanna quit because its probably one of the better environments to work in (other than that dumb coworker and some customers) as well as being well paid. i just needed to vent this out, i hope someone reaches out."

depression,"I have to go back to work tonight, and I'm dreading it  This is my first job, and I've barely been working a week, but it already feels like it's wearing me down. I make about $1450/hr, but it just doesn't seem worth it. I can't seem to work as fast as my peers, and the pain from being on my feet constantly slows me down even more. I feel horrid, but I can't even quit. Not only is it payday, but everyone else would also be so disappointed in me. I felt so useless and guilty for so long for not doing much with my time, other than drawing and playing video games. Now that I have a job, my family is mostly proud of me, but I still feel guilty and useless, like I'm just a burden by existing near other people, like I'm dragging everyone down. Now there's physical pain and a lack of free time on top of that. I've been crying rivers before and after work. I was even told that I looked as if I were dying from depression. It's such a struggle. I might get fired soon anyway for working too slowly, but that would just be another disappointment. I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. I never asked to exist, so why does it take so much effort just to keep existing? Why do we spend so much of our lives just suffering?  I'm supposed to finally start college this year too. I don't think I can handle it. There's already so little time and energy left for the day when I come home from work. I don't understand how people live happily like this. If there was a way to escape this and live a happy, fulfilling life, I would. My brain just doesn't seem wired for this world. It's not fair. I didn't ask for this, but I'm the one paying for it. I just want to sleep and dream."
depression,"Understanding the Triggers of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  The entire world can feel like a minefield if you or a loved one battles with episodes from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms can erupt without any warning. No matter how erratic they may be, usually, symptoms flare up from internal and external ignition known as triggers.

Although life with PTSD can be devastating at times, you don’t have to go at it alone. Here at I Got U, a psychotherapist is always available to help. By working with a [qualified mental health professional](http://igotucorp.com/team/) who can assist you with understanding your triggers, you will, in time, learn to manage symptoms effectively and healthily so that healing from your trauma can begin.

### Where Do PTSD Triggers Come From?

Our bodies have a built-in defense mechanism called “fight-or-flight” that kicks in when we’re in a dangerous or life-threatening situation. It’s an instinctual survival mode that revs up our heart rate, pumps adrenaline into our blood, and puts our senses on high alert.

Being in a state of elevated awareness and intense vigilance lets us absorb as much detail about the situation as possible. Still, it consequently causes the brain to suspend some of its normal functions like short-term memory. These physiological enhancements help us cope with perceived or real danger in the immediacy of frightening circumstances. However, in the long-term, they can make it extremely challenging to process the events.

Unfortunately, with unprocessed trauma, the brain keeps the original incident alive and present for months or years, even when it isn’t. That’s why the appearance of any subtlety or trivial aspect connected with the memory of that trauma can trigger PTSD symptoms and make you feel as if you’re living the unfortunate experience all over again. With the guidance and insurance of a [psychotherapist](https://www.melaninandmentalhealth.com/directory-therapists/listing/vincente-mozell/) at I Got U, you may be able to see many of the triggers that kick you into overdrive that you didn’t realize were adversely affecting you. They can be any people, places, things, or experiences that bring to mind the traumatic event.

#### Classifying Internal and External Triggers

There are two basic categories that PTSD triggers can fall into: internal and external. An internal trigger deals with all the things that happen within your body like your emotions, thoughts, and bodily sensations. An external trigger can be a particular person, a certain place, or specific situations that occur in the environment around you and outside of your mind that disrupts your mental health and makes you recall the trauma you experienced or evoke feelings you had during a distressing moment from your past.

**Internal triggers can include:**

* Feeling out of control, overwhelmed, abandoned, or vulnerable
* Memories associated with the traumatic event
* Muscle tension
* Anxiety
* Pain
* Sadness
* Anger
* External triggers could be:

**External triggers could be:**

* The anniversary of the event
* Running into someone related to the trauma in some way
* Seeing someone who has physical features that are similar to someone related to the trauma
* Hearing or reading certain words or phrases
* Distinct smells, like fumes, associated with the event
* News articles, TV programs, movies, or videos that remind you of the trauma
* Visual cues linked to the traumatic experience like a street sign, a particular color, an article of clothing, or a building
* Specific sounds that may have been heard during the event, such as sirens or screams

#### Being Mindful of Your Triggers

Not all PTSD triggers are apparent. That’s why getting help from a [mental health services provider](http://igotucorp.com/about-us/), like the one you can find at I Got U, can be a beacon shining its light across the ocean after being lost at sea. A psychotherapist is that empathetic observer who can help you see what’s there, even if you aren’t able to. Sometimes it can be tough to determine what triggers you if you can’t be objective.

If you cope with post-traumatic stress, think back to times when you showed symptoms. Can you remember what was going on near you or where you were? Can you recall the types of thoughts you might have been having at the time? It’s possible when you were symptomatic that exposure to recurring triggers caused the PTSD episodes.

You might not be able to detect all that arouses you on your own. However, by working with a mental health professional, you can gradually explore and discover your internal and external triggers in a safe and supportive environment. Your psychotherapist can then teach you to recognize how these triggers affect you and provide you with coping strategies you can perfect with time.

You’re not alone in this. Remember that “[I Got U](http://igotucorp.com/).” With the proper help, you can improve your daily function and eventually regain control of your symptoms and, subsequently, your life. You can either ride the waves or be drowned beneath them. Don’t waste another second, contact us today if you are ready to restore peace in your life."
depression,"I don't deserve friends. I can't understand or show simple emotions. This has led my doctor to suspect I might have autism, or that I'm on the spectrum. Honestly, I believe it more and more. It would explain why I'm like this. I don't know, I hate that I can't just be normal."
depression,"im 13 years old and im already too close to death i cant do this much longer.
My family is broken. divorce has ruined it all.

My mom is a controlling abusive manipulative homophobic piece of shit. I've been dreaming of getting HRT for years ohh the beloved hormone therapy..

im just a fucking.. i dont know im useless. im weak and tired, im never healthy. i haven't seen a doctor in 2 years because my mom says i never need one. everything i do just has to heal by itself. My mom LITERALLY MAKES MY DAD PAY FOR OUR HEALTH CARE BUT SPENDS THE MONEY FOR HERSELF AND REFUSES TO LET US SEE A DOCTOR EVER
im going to hang myself if i get rope. or if i don't id probably starve to death because of my self diagnosed eating disorder. my mom doesn't care. i cant do anything. i cant go to my dad or else my mom will just take me back using her lawyer to make my dad give me to her.
im going to die one way or another. either i kill myself, or my body stops functioning. i can notice my heart beats are sometimes more painful than last weeks."
depression,"I'm 19 and my life is a fucking mess This is just going to be a massive messy rant. I'm sorry if half of it doesn't make sense.




I just lost my job I worked SO fuckinf hard to get!! I have no money to pay my bills I live in a very small town in the west Midlands so it's near impossible for me to find an easy job, my nan is terminal with cancer, my mum is very ill at the moment and it sucks seeing her struggle all the time, I've already tried to kill myself twice since I was 12, 
 my brother and uncle are severely autistic and house bound (neither of them have left the house since they were about 3 and 5) and my brother is mute. Both older than me by 2 years and 3 years.

 I'm the only one in the family my mum has that will support and look after them now until I or them die. I know it may be selfish but sometimes I wish they were normal, i have never and will never have a normal life I've never had the fun teenage years that most do, and now for the rest of my life I have to make sure its perfect to care for these two, I can never relax and everything I always wanted to do like go to college and become something, isn't possible.

I feel like I just mess up everything, I have NO friends, not a single one, my family live 2 hours away from me, i tried so hard with my job, I worked double shifts without getting payed, I worked from 7am until 12am at night and had to walk 30mins + home and I never complained, and then they fired me because I didn't answer my phone for one day because I was with my nan on my day off.  Nothing ever fucking works out. 

I don't know how to fix things, I've started drinking cause why not? Life's a mess anyway and I have nothing else to help me with it all. I've already had an eviction notice cause I can't pay my rent, I just fuckinf give up.


This isn't an advice post or a pity post, if anything I'd prefer if people didn't comment I just need to get it all out, I have no one to talk to about anything"

depression,"i give up, not on life, but in trying to fit into a friend group and society as a whole. if theres a god out there, i hate them with every atom of them fucking being, i dont know whats wrong with me, but my entire life ive been cursed with being so mentally ill that i dont fit anywhere in society and let alone any friend group, any effort i make results in NOTHING.
I like to think im a good person, im not racist, homophobic, transphobic or just hateful in general, im not quick to judge, and despite all that, there are people with those traits that succeed in social groups more than i do, despite how hard i try to be a good person, it all results to nothing, i fucking hate whatever higher power cursed me to be this unimaginably unlucky.
ive never asked for being the favorite in a friend group, just to be IN one and feel accepted, every friend group ive been in has always resulted in ending quickly due to me or someone elses bullshit.
i cant stand when i vent to someone about this shit and they say ""just try and be more comfortable around people!"", guess what? i was once comfortable around people until EVERYONE i thought i could trust just left me for something or someone better, all i want in life is some friendship, yet im easily replacable as always."
depression,"I am ending my life. 40 year old male. I have nothing left in me. *trigger warnings* I am absolutely done with this world. I have spent my entire life and suffered homelessness, child abuse that involves incest, rape, molestation, beatings to the point I could barely move, bleeding, etc. 

I have endured a life of pure hell and its not getting easier. I also struggle with morbid obesity and fought with it for over 30 yrs. I am on a shit ton of meds that don't help for anything in the world. been denied 15 times for weight loss surgery.

Living on disability getting 800 a month to live on and in debt where 200 of my check goes to paying back the government from where they said they overpaid me on my disability check I owe them 9k, for the next 4 years. I have 3 credit cards I had to take out and use to get dental work and other things done medically that insurance wouldn't cover. 

I have no extra income. there are days I can barely get out of bed because of how badly my body hurts because of the weight and the arthritis I have in my lower back, knees, feet and ankles. 

most of my family are dead, my mom died when I was 25, my real dad when I was 23. I spent 10 yrs being homeless doing day labor for food or a bed to sleep in that night. 

I bought a car 4 years ago that took me 5 yrs to save 2k. got scammed by the dealership. still can't save any money to try to buy another vehicle to live in.

Bought a gaming laptop that got damaged during shipment with the first stimulus check a couple years ago and sent it back, the shipper accused me of the damage and refused to refund or replace the laptop. 

spent the past 12 years in the dating scene and all I get is rejected because of my weight. told I am disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone or a relationship. laughed at, mocked at, made fun of and even told to kill myself because I am a joke. 

since I was 18 all I have wanted was a good woman to love and build a life with, now here I am 40 and only had sex once via a hooker and found out, I do not enjoy sex without feelings or emotions and can't get hard because I didn't have feelings for her and don't enjoy casual sex. 

I have spent over 20 yrs without being touched, hugged, or anything by anyone. I went to the dentist about 4 years ago and the assistant did a cancer screening on me, which involved feeling around my neck, skull, jaw line etc and I ended up having to leave and broke down crying hysterically because it felt so amazing being touched by another human being for once in my entire life. 

I can't keep living a life like this fighting and struggling and for nothing in return and being treated as if I was some kind of monster. I am done living and done with this life. I can't keep living being alone and single, unloved, uncared for missing out in having a real relationship with a woman who I love and care for and her love and care for me. both of us being intimate with each other etc. 

I just can't live life anymore. so I am done, and I am about to end it. goodbye."
depression,"I’m so fucking sick of my bedroom We all know the stereotype, the ‘depression room’, well al of these people online just show some light clutter with a few clothes on the floor, but mine is fucking DISGUSTING and I can’t do anything about it.

There’s moldy food and packets and rubbish everywhere and I can barely walk in it, I feel sick just looking at it and I can’t ever find anything.

Does anybody have any idea about how tf I can clean this without losing motivation?"
depression,"I think I'm a terrible person and I really wished I wasn't alive I'm a terrible person and I know it. I'm shitty towards my family, my friends and to myself. I honestly don't want to be alive because I feel like everyone I come in contact with will eventually become miserable like me. I think this started ever since I was a little girl. I've always been a really highly sensitive person and anxious person. Whenever someone treats me badly, I hold an enormous grudge against them. I desperately want them to feel the hurt I went through when they did that to me but you see, that always goes really badly. Whenever someone does or says something mean to me, I never tell it straight to their face but rather keep it inside until one day I explode and cry to someone about it. The person always ends up finding out and honestly each time I feel really shitty about it. For example, recently, I had a group project that really stressed me out because I felt like I was the one putting more effort and time into it, so one day I couldnt take it anymore and I started to break down and I ranted about it to my teacher. I wasn't going to name names but then my teacher asked me about it and I had to answer because one way or another, she would've figured it out. I told her and today, she scheduled a meeting with one of the groupmates that I pointed out. So basically, this groupmate is know for not doing her work and it was true, I did assign her work to do but she never done it and always said that she has no time. Out of all my groupmates, I felt like she was putting in the least effort and because of that I didnt really have anything nice to say about her to my teacher. However, after speaking with my teacher, I learned that she is really struggling with her work too and that made me think that I shouldnt have said anything about her at all...but thats too late...she's also really close to my close friend in school but I was too scared to say anything because I did not want it to end up in a huge fight and I was certain that it would. Thus, I always resorted to being fake with her and agreed that she did a lot of work and even gossiped about my other groupmates behind their backs... But, my teacher end up telling her what I said and I think that her and my close friend hates me now...I also ended up worrying and crying about it to my mom and we ended up in a huge fight because she says that I always do things like this and when it blows up on me I end up breaking down. She also says that I'm in the wrong for ranting to my teacher but I only did that because I know she's tired of listening to me rant and honestly I felt better after talking to my teacher about it. My mother and I said really mean things to each other during the fight and it really felt like I was stabbed in my back. I genuinely think that I'm a terrible person that for being the way I am...and I feel like the world would honestly be a better place without me..."
depression,"I’m so far away It’s like tomorrow I’ll be dead but the day never comes…why would it matter if I’m going to die anyway

I remember thinking that while I was younger..I could’ve saved all that time dealing w unnecessary pain when all I had to do was let go.

I always knew it was bs from the start. There’s no need to make a big deal now. I just need to let go. I don’t need to pretend anymore..it’s funny"
depression,"I dont feel like doing anything at all. How do I get out if bed, stop using my phone so much and do something? I do the bare minimum to get by, I have a job that I hate, but I dont feel motivated to actually do something about it, I don't want to kill myself but I dont wanna live like this anymore. I usually smoke a lot of weed and that helps me not notice the mind numbing grind of everyday life, but of late, I haven't been able to get any (its illegal in my country). I don't feel like doing anything, how do I make it stop? I just want to feel like a normal, driven person. I have so many things that I want to achieve, but dont feel like even taking the first step towards it. 
I want to get better. How do I get through this?"
depression,"Where do you go when you belong nowhere? I was diagnosed major depressive disorder 8 years ago (when I was 13) it’s been a never ending battle since. I remember one day someone said to me “you look happier lately” and that was a good summer I was about to turn 18, and life was looking like it would start being better. Then my mom died 3 days before my birthday and I found her. Instead of acting like a total wreck, it was more of a shock and I was extremely numb and closed off after that for a long time. It’s been 3 years this month and just this past week I finally came to terms and realized just how hurt and deeply embedded in my depression I’ve been. Having a job, car, place of my own, it was like a front and something that convinced me and others that I’ve been fine. But I’m so not. Depression has taken my energy, creativity, personality, I’m so antisocial it’s just anxiety and fear to be around people sometimes. My boyfriend has been wanting to break up and told me this morning he made out with some random at a bar last weekend while wasted and that he had sex with 2 different people in the last couple years. My cousins daughter who is more like a niece to me and only 9 has cancer and goes for her second round of chemo today. I just started a job 3 weeks ago and today is the 5th day I’ve missed. I don’t see how I can do this anymore and I don’t even think I want to."
depression,"I feel like time is just passing by So I’m 19 and honestly I always felt like I’m older.. I turn 20 in a few months and it’s just the same shit everyday like everything seems pointless and the fact that we’re all just living to die is just depressing ..sometimes I just wish I was never born. It’s like when I achieve a “goal” I made for myself I’m just like what now? Life is a joke and a game to me honestly, I don’t even care for social status and lately for me everything has always been about money. Like everything is just pointless and just watching my mom get old and thinking of how she has to die, like we all have to go one day it just seems depressing like I’m grateful to be “healthy” and everything but idk I’m just tearing up typing this. Like what’s the meaning of life. I don’t even care to be in a relationship even though I’ve had many chances to. It’s like I know people just for them to become a memory. Everything is temporary and the fact that one day im just gonna be bones is ridiculous. I wish I was never born. I remember just being little now I’m literally a grown ass adult now basically meaning more responsibilities. I’m tired of this planet."
depression,"Things can get better! I understand sometimes people post on here to vent. But, based on when I used to use this Reddit a lot, people also look for a bit of hope.

You can see my previous posts. Before I was suicidal. I self harmed a lot. I was unhappy and didn’t feel secure in the friendships I had. 

Now we are 8months into the year and I’m doing really well. Self harming less, I’ve been productive with my time, I have better relationships with everyone around me, I’m taking my medication properly and I’m back in therapy. I’m not going to pretend it’s been plain sailing. I’ve slipped up a few times. I have days where everything is too much and I can’t concentrate and feel overwhelmed. But those days are few and far between, and they seem more manageable now. I’m finally learning to look after myself and set appropriate boundaries, while also now being able to be there for my friends too because I’m in a better place.

I’ve had issues with my mental health for ten years. It’s difficult. And maybe I started getting better for the wrong reasons. But it’s turned into me realising I’m the only person that’s 100% there for me. Other people encourage and support, and that really helps. But it’s only you that will save you.

I’ve started wanting things again. I’m finishing my education and becoming a teacher. I’ll hopefully be moving in with my partner next year. I’m enjoying living. 

I hope this gives you hope for a brighter future."
depression,"I leave a trail of destruction everywhere I go..the belief that I am a horrible human being is the source of my depression. I’m trying to believe I’m a good person but as I reflect on things I did in the past, I can’t continue to lie to mysel. I  am starting to see that I’m a wretched horrible monster. Last year, my landlord got obsessive and wanted a relationship, I didn’t want anything with him and made it clear. It didn’t stop me from taking 25 grand from him and leaving him in debt. I also met a guy and we spoke here and there but I wasn’t making enough at my job and he gave me 2 grand during the course of us knowing eachother. I met another guy, he was in a relationship, I knew this and continued to have an affair with him and I ruined his relationship, knowing that I had no intention on being serious or forming any kind of situation with him. 

All of this is killing me. My depression makes me numb and unable to really feel much and I’m afraid I maybe a narcissist or have some kind of personality disorder that I am unaware of. I don’t want to be this way, I don’t want people to have bad thoughts when they think of me. I can’t forgive myself."
depression,"my heart is breaking. my second favorite grandma broke my heart. she blamed me for my mother abusing me when i was ages 7-9. she told me i acted up, “painted my nails before the bus came”, and “went home with a boy once”. i remember everything from then, i never did any of those things. my mother was doing cocaine and she was mentally abusing me. i told my grandma that my mom threatened to put cameras around the house because i was “acting up”. i wonder why? my mother was terrible to me, and so was my stepdad. my grandma told me all of this yesterday, because i started a new medicine and explained how my depression came around when i was about 9-10. i’ve had it ever since. i told my grandma why, i told her it was because of my mom and trauma that i acquired at that time. but she didn’t believe me, and for her to make me think that it was my fault for my mother treating me that way; well, that hurts. i started a new medicine a few days ago and i tried to talk to my grandma about what i went through and why i need medicine now, and she blamed me. i am sorry for anyone who has gotten blamed for their depression. please keep going, we got this. &lt;3"
depression,"It's been a year since I've been put on the waiting list for therapy. Is it okay to ask her when I'll be able to start or is it considered rude? My depression and other symptoms are manageable, but my life is pretty meh.
While I'm staying functional (go to work and see people), I lack deeper connection (I have avoidant personality disorder with depressive-anxious episodes). I have a really low motivation and only do things because I have to. I am so ready for a change, but the waiting is killing me. I'm constantly thinking how everything would be better if I'd start therapy sooner, but the time never comes. I feel like I'm floating in the middle of nowhere and don't have experience much joy except occasional laughs, but not much of the longer lasting happiness. Even if I'm traveling with my friends I feel like I'm living my life behind a curtain and don't fully experience anything.

So to stop the venting... I feel pretty hopeless and would like to get a piece of hope. I really want to see this specific therapist (she seemed fine and it would be covered by health insurance). I don't know where to go instead - therapy is too expensive for me since I'm just going month by month.

I also want to know to know that she didn't forget about me, as crazy as it sounds. Or that they didn't lose my contact by mistake. She did tell me, a year ago, that I'll probably have to wait a bit, but she couldn't tell me how long because her clients are all in the long-term type of therapy so they need to take their time, which is understandable."
depression,"I think I am running out of time guys Most days nowadays I want to be gone. All of my problems just keep stacking up and I’ve been trying real hard but it’s just not working out. Honestly I don’t see what’s so bad about not existing. I don’t know, somedays I want to give up."

It makes me just want to be near my husband but knowing he isn’t happy with me is just killing me inside.

depression,"Can depression makes you lack empathy? It's been 2 years that I was feeling like I didn't care about nothing at all and always feeling sad/meh. I didn't know what was wrong with me. I hated myself because sometimes I lacked cognitive/emotional empathy as if it was too much energy for my brain? Like if someone would talk about something that made them sad I would know that they were sad but I would still feel ""meh"". Like I couldn't touch any emotion.


Now that I'm on antidepressant it's all coming back and I'm so glad. I don't feel like a monster anymore and I'm normal again. I didn't know it was depression that could have caused this? It's nowhere in the dsm that it can cause lack of empathy?"

It was just 08-15 was very bad, I had thoughts of giving up, and now my mood suddenly improved, but I don't know if this is a normal mood or maybe be hypomania. I just feel recovered from depression right now, but at the same time I am worried it might be hypomania. And it certainly can't be BPD because it happens spontaneously. In unipolar depression, is it normal for a sudden onset of optimism and good mood? I'm sorry I haven't been diagnosed with bp2 and I'm here to be here, but I need a little help."
depression,"How do you manage when you have absolutely no energy? Hello,

I'm not sure where to begin but I figured this would be an ok place. I have been dealing with quite a bit and you are welcome to read my previous comment I made in another thread that goes into detail.

While I am figuring things out, I'd like to ask how you all cope with depression as I lose motivation EA h day that passes. I dread waking up, the drive to work, talking to people. My energy and will to do things are nonexistent as I don't even enjoy doing what I like doing. My free time is spent playing games and reading as that is how I like to unwind but I have not been in the mood to do either of those things.

I would like to make it clear that I do have any intentions of hurting myself and I am still coming to terms with depression and PTSD. I force myself to manage the day but it is extremely tiring to the point where I don't do much on my time off. The most I do is laundry to make sure I have clothes for the week. I have been eating once a day which I understand is not healthy but I have no appetite and do not want to force something I may not hold down.

It seems I am doing the minimum to keep doing and realize that I cannot do that for long or it may get worse. I am stressed, depressed, anxious and reaching out for help while I am still somewhat rational as it is hard. 

I take B12 as I have a vitamin deficiency though it doesn't seem like it helps. I do also take some heart medicine as the VA still hasn't figured out those issues. While I am not in a relationship, I am seeing someone though I am not sure how long that will last either as my sexual drive has been nonsexist for a while as I know stress and anxiety can effect it. I have been talking to my doctor and it seems I am showing signs of ED though so there is more to add to my plate.

Regardless of it all, I am reaching out to get your input to better myself and thank you for any information."
depression,"My father is having an affair and my mom doesn't know about it I over heard him talking to the other lady on phone.

The conversation confirmed that he is having an affair.
This is killing me inside. He is not the man I knew. I am not even sure why he is doing all this.
Please help. I am 26 male. My father is over 60.

Please please help me. Please advice on what to do."
depression,"I hate myself 
I hate myself. I’ve been saying this to myself several hundred times a day lately. I’m 37 years old but still think and behave as I’m in my early 20s most of the time. I have two children but am not with their mother because she cheated on me in probably the worst way imaginable 8 years ago when the kids were still in cribs. I’ve had a few girlfriends and friends with benefits since then but have never felt any connection with any of them. I broke up with one girl I had been dating for a few years because she wanted to move in with me but I like being alone most of the time. I’m not seeing anyone right now so kind of lonely but I still wouldn’t want someone around me all day. 

I have a job that pays very well yet I make poor financial decisions and find myself in money problems sometimes. I’ve lost 10k in the stock market the last year and habitually buy shit I don’t need. I know this but yet I keep doing it. My job is actually the only thing keeping me somewhat sane, if you can even call this sane. 

I don’t hang out with my friends much anymore because they are mostly married or in long term relationships and I feel weird usually being the only person at the gatherings that is by themselves. They all went on a trip to Mexico this week and guess what I was doing? I went, alone, to go get another huge tattoo on my inner forearm that I’m already regretting. Two really brilliant people I was aquainted with recently died tragically and I’m here alive doing stupid shit like getting tattoos. Why cut those people’s lives short and keep me here doing stupid shit?

I’ve been talking to myself a lot lately and having extreme emotional swings going from feeling like I’m the king of the world to why am I even alive?  This happens in just a span of a few minutes. I started riding my bike 20 miles every morning and jogging 3 miles in the evenings. This helps while I’m actually doing this but not when I’m back home with my thoughts. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m about to cry then just start laughing at how stupid I can be. This isn’t normal and I don’t know what I can do to make it better."

I know it is the best choice cuz she is 16 and I'm 19 but I really love her but I don't want to go to prison. Even so it makes me really depressed cuz I don't know what she will do when I tell her this. She has some mental shut going on as well and I don't want to make her feel that way. After all I really care for her but the law doesn't care about that. 

The most difficult part is that she cuts herself and I helped her so she wouldn't cut herself anymore. I'm afraid that she will begin to cut herself and maybe even tries to kill herself.

depression,"I Wasted High School I wasn’t socially prepared for high school. Depression didn’t help. I talk to people in high school who are way younger than me and holy shit they have done so much more than me (in terms of relationship stuff and just general social stuff). For context, I just finished a terrible freshman year of online college. I hated almost all of high school, and as soon as it got good in senior year quarantine happened.

Idfk what I’m doing. This is probably just a rant. Advice on how to get out of this social hole would be good. I have friends but we don’t hang out as often as I’d like and I have no larger social group. I just want to have a high school experience without being as young and stupid.

I was on desvenlaflaxine (generic Pristq) 150mg, which is a higher dose for this med. Should I go back to 150mg? Or start from scratch at 50mg? Or meet in the middle at 100mg?

Thank you in advance.

(I know I should not have weaned off on my own but my GPs (plural, I've seen multiple) understanding of mental health treatments are basic at best and I thought I could manage it myself. I was wrong. Moving on now)."
depression,"I don't see the color in the world anymore. I don't do anything all day. I wake up and sit at my computer on the lock screen. I've hovered over video games but I cant bring myself to press play. I don't talk to my friends anymore. I don't leave my room unless I have too. I only eat and workout because of the basic human need to. It gets to me sometimes, I've never cut but ive gotten really close, sometimes I'll take a dull knife and run it across my wrist to feel the adrenaline. But yet I feel like I have nothing to complain about, I feel like I don't have the right to feel like this. I have amazing parents and a roof over my head but I'm still like this. I don't see the color in the world anymore, everything is just black and white. I wish I could've stayed 12, when everything was amazing and I would go to school with a smile, and my face would light up when I see my parents or my sister, when I would play basketball for hours on end with my friend. I wish I could talk to 12 year old me, ask him if his proud of me or if he resents me for ruining his life. The sparkle in my eyes faded ever since 7th grade and in the brief moments of laughter and happiness I get are only a few seconds of vibrant colors compared to the hours of monochrome."
depression,"Bipolar What are the symptoms or bipolar disorder?
I think I may have it. I  have extreme happiness and sadness and barely in the middle.I had so many toxic relationships. I self harmed and had no self respect for my body.I was told it was depression no one would check if I really had bipolar disorder. I have spouts of anger and madness for no reason and there might be more.
Does that affect me having tulpa?"
depression,"I have lost all motivation I apologize it’s kind of a long post and kind of a rant to get it off my chest.

I’m 25(m) and have no idea what to do. I feel like I’m in a stalemate with life. 

I’m married to an amazing woman who I can’t make happy anymore. And it may be due to her post-partum depression. But like I have lost all motivation to try and fix things because I feel like they can’t be fixed. All we do is fight and argue and it feels like we’re both walking on eggshells 24/7. I’ve recently gotten help and gotten on medication to help me but all it does it help me hold in my emotions more instead of express them which ends with me blowing up every couple of weeks. 

I’ve lost the motivation to take care of myself. I’ve put on weight. Started smoking cigarettes even more and struggle to do normal things like dishes and clean the house.

Also I’m working myself to death it feels like. My body is destroyed from my younger years and I have a very physical labor job but I can’t leave it because it pays to well.

It feels like the only things that make me happy right now are my 8 month old son who I love so much, and my little alone time I get to myself to play video games.

I just feel like I’m under a ridiculous amount of stress and I’m depressed af and just don’t know what to do."
depression,I am 22 from Soul before she went to earth except I still don't feel anything. I just watched this movie and felt really identified with 22 before going to earth. I also felt identified with Joe since he's alone and feels like a loser. Soul is a great movie.
depression,"I feel like a dog with a shock collar on but the collar is just part of me, and I can’t figure out what sets it off I am sickened by things. Repulsed. Most of them are memories of mine, thoughts of the future, realizations and insights throughout the day that just jolt me.

I used to self harm and sometimes I suspect that my body never really stopped self harming- without a blade, my brain just figured out how to hurt itself, and now I just mentally stab myself as an impulse response to things.

My life is a mess. I can’t control myself. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed by a random thought that I will be paralyzed, in fetal position on the ground, for an hour or more. 

I have long, tedious calls with mental health care providers, answering question after question, none of it matters to me. It’s like so disconnected from what’s actually going on.

I have day dreams, little impulsive thoughts, about being hacked to pieces. An axe swings down, takes off a piece of me. My bones break, my body crumples, but I don’t even have the will to groan in pain or move. I’m just totally resigned, maybe even grateful.

By any sensical account my life is not only good but intensely privileged. It is a fluke of chemistry that I am the horrible creature that I am."

I hate being such a loser and a depressed fuck up. Everything I try to do ends up failing. All I want is for someone to at least LIKE me let alone love me for who I am. My friends have all gotten tired of me, and they don’t respond to any of my texts, and most of them will just leave me on read or block me. They don’t even just say “yeah I just don’t like you anymore you’re just hard to be around.” At this point I wish they would. I just want someone to talk to me. But they won’t. What’s the point of even being alive if you have no one? I just want to kill myself and save myself from the pain in my future. I guess that makes me a coward but if that means I’m dead soon so fucking be it. I’m just really sad and no one cares. I want to die everyday and it’s never going to stop. God help me."

depression,"Falling slow-motion off the ladder back into the dark abyss Severe physical, emotional, psychological abuse, PTSD, addiction, depression, s*****al ideation, self-infliction and multiple attempts for a culmination of 15 years. 

I have read Reddit for many years but made very few posts, so I hope maybe by the end of this something will come of it that may help another reader. 

After over a decade of struggling and being afraid to come forward, I finally started seeing a doctor, therapist, and psychiatrist about a year ago. Two days ago was the 1-year anniversary of when my siblings found me hanging and cut the rope. 

I have tried so many medications, multiple therapists, and different new-age attempts at rewiring my brain through the psychiatrist. 

I still feel as though I know nothing, despite being in my final semester of a bachelor’s degree. If you asked me anything from any class I’ve taken, I couldn’t tell you a thing. On paper though, it looks as if I’ve passed everything with As. I feel as though I can’t retrieve any memories, can’t formulate any conversation, and have no desire to make friends. I just want to be alone. 

Recently I can feel that I’m falling back into the black. My thoughts dwell on my longing for death to peacefully take me away from all of this pain. 

The people around me view me as stupid, a klutz, an idiot, I’ve even had people tell me they thought I was “r*tarded” or mentally handicapped before. I often wonder if I am, and if people are playing along with me. In my heart and soul I know something is wrong with my brain, I just don’t know what it is. And doctors refuse to listen. I feel myself falling back into wanting to hurt or cause pain. Wanting to indulge in darkness. I don’t know what to do. The doctors, psychiatrist, and therapist are not available when I can see them, and their responses have basically been “Oh well, guess you don’t want to see us bad enough.” I have no money and can’t afford to take one day off to see them.  I feel like I’ve exhausted all branches of help. 

TLDR; PTSD, anxiety, depression, addiction, used therapy, doctors, and medication, falling back to depression and su**idal ideation. 

What helps you? You, reading this, personally? What suggestions do you have that might help someone falling back into the pits of despair and hopelessness? 

Thank you"
depression,"How long do olanzapine withdrawal symptoms last? I was prescribed 5mg as an adjuvant for venlafaxine, but it didn't help and made me hungry all the time (and my appetite before was normal).

I started by taking 2.5mg for a week, then 5mg for 6 weeks, and before stopping I was on 2.5mg for a week (overall 2 months).

The first week after stopping I had reduced appetite. After that, my appetite went down to 0 and has been like this for 2 weeks. Not even my daily mirtazapine (45mg) managed to give me appetite (and it used to before).

How much longer would I have to deal with this? I have never been prescribed a med that fucked me up so long after stopping it, especially not after only taking it 2 months (and I've been prescribed *a lot* of different meds)."

depression,"Help My depression has turned me into a shell of the person that I (22F) once was. I’ve been through several episodes of severe clinal depression.

I used to consider myself very intelligent. I was a gifted student, winning awards and ranking in the 99th percentile on standardized tests. Now I’m in community college struggling to pass the same courses I took at an AP equivalent years ago. Perhaps most alarmingly, I can’t learn anything new. I try and I try to retain what I take in, but the honest truth is that I’ve cheated on most of my coursework.

Aside from my deteriorating intelligence, I was unbelievably creative. I used to draw, write- create-with such a level of detail and vividness I was consistently told my art and writing felt real and touched people at the core. It’s been 7 months since I’ve seriously tried to draw anything. Longer since I’ve written.

Also, just generally Im slow in conversations. This is something I noticed develop during quarantine. I started living alone for the first time in my life after a breakup. Now I say utterly /dumb/ shit when I do speak to people- it’s like I have no filter and my brain is at 10% operating power. This has made it difficult for therapy to be effective, because I’m so self-conscious about how I communicate.

I’m terrified. If this is the course of my life- I don’t want it. If Im stagnating, to solve this, I feel I need to go on some sort of journey to find the lost parts of me, or at least a place where I feel more at peace.

I try to practice mindfulness, but without fail I prioritize work and school- which stress me immensely- the 2 things my psychologist recommended I throw myself headlong into. It doesn’t work for me though. I need time in a day to just exist, I can’t be mentally stimulated all the time- it’s exhausting.

I have one close friend. I don’t see him more than once a week on average. He’s busy with 3 jobs. I would love to have more friends, but I never seem to connect with people anymore.

Why am I like this? And is there any advice you can offer?"

When I get rejected by people I think that love me, I get extremely sad and feel heartbroken and betrayed altough rejecting someone is very OK. I dunno why man, I am like this...

depression,"Can’t afford to see a therapist or psychiatrist Unfortunately in the great U.S. of A., one needs a solid job with benefits to be able to take off one day, or even one morning, in order to see a doctor. These jobs are getting harder and harder to come by, even if you are fortunate enough to have a bachelor’s or master’s degree. 

For those who are simply unable to afford the time or money it takes for one day off to see doctors, what do those of us who have that ability have to offer as advice? Or what has helped those reading who don’t have the abilities to seek professional help? 

Say someone is dealing with severe PTSD, depression, anxiety, no longer has a will to live, or make connections with people. The typical response is therapy and doctors, but many people just simply don’t have access.

I had a horrible childhood, my mom was horribly abusive, both mentally and physically, i never had any friends, quite literally, because of how scared of people i am, and school has put even more of strain on my mental health. Even with good grades.

My mom has diagnosed BPD and depression. My sister has diagnosed bipolar 2, social anxiety, ptsd and depression, so what are the chances of me having these same problems?

I want to go somewhere to try and find out whats wrong with me, get a diagnosis for SOMETHING, and at least try to figure out my problems, but i have no way to do so.

It just hurts that she is already dating and it makes me feel like we never had love to begin with. She tries to give me help and advice about love but then she contradicts herself by doing something that is the opposite of what she told me. It makes me question if I was truly loved or if I'll ever be able to form a relationship with someone. 

And she wants me to talk to her bf when she brings her over. He is a nice guy and I there's nothing wrong with. I just dont wanna talk to him because of the situation with me and my roommate.

depression,"Kinda a rant? I feel stuck and don’t know how to move forward. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety quite bad for the past few years (I’m 18f) and as a result I feel like I am quite behind in life I guess. 
I left school early to do a beauty course which I enjoyed and thought I would like to go into that industry but towards the end of it I completely lost interest which negatively impacted my mental health, then I worked in a hair salon just as an assistant for 6 months and I finished there about a year and a half ago now and have not worked since. 
Since I finished the course I did, I have not been able to find any sort of career that interests me for longer than a few months which just really puts me in a rut by not being able to decide on something and formulate a plan to work toward. It also feels like I let myself down.
 I’ve pretty much been living life by myself since I finished school as I don’t really have many hobbies or any friends to really talk to or hang out with, and as a result of this I never leave the comfort that is my room and it’s really hard for me to go out anywhere in public. One thing that I think would benefit me greatly would be getting a job but I just can never seem to keep any positive thoughts towards finding one, in the last two months I have applied to about 5 (which takes a lot of effort for me to do) and not heard back, but the day after I apply I end up having a major panic attack over it and hoping I don’t get a call back because the thought of going to an interview is terrifying to me (and I’m sure a lot of others). 
I’ve spoken to my mum about my worries and she is very supportive of me which I’m very grateful for and she helped work on my resume for me and explained my skills and things to me but even with this support it’s still so hard to find something. I found a reception job which seems like an alright thing for me to do and I have written a cover letter for it but I’ve talked myself out of applying and can start to feel the negative thoughts tumbling around me already. It’s hard to find something as I have very minimal experience and don’t want to work more than 25 hours a week (I know I’m picky). This might seem like a silly thing to be distressed about but it’s a topic that has been my biggest worry for a while and I would like to be making money so I can help with bills and be able to have money to spend for myself, I have things that motivate me to want a job but I just feel so stuck and like I can’t make myself take any steps to actually move forward.  It’s something that if I haven’t been keeping on top of supporting myself, I end up spiralling and having a breakdown over and getting very worked up about. 
I’m not sure if any of that really makes sense of what I’m trying to say but I’m just so over feeling this way and being afraid of something so simple as applying for a job. I think it’s more what comes after I’ve applied like getting a phone call for an interview and then what questions I’ll be asked at the interview and meeting new people, and then if I do get the job what if I mess it up or don’t like it? 
I think that a part of me holds myself back because I’m scared to be doing normal life things, I stay home pretty much everyday and don’t really do much other than be in bed and read or watch tv, so it’s scary to think about going out and having something to do even if it is only a few days a week. 
My apologies for the long post but I’d really appreciate any advice or something, even just if anyone has felt/feels anything similar."

My therapist said that I talk more in person when my mom’s not there and so he told me I should say less.
depression,"I can't make any sense of my thoughts or emotions This post is pretty much me trying to put abstract thoughts into words, so this may not make much sense or be in a logical order.

I can't make any sense of my thoughts or emotions. 

For as long as I can remember my general mood has been following a set pattern, where for a few months my emotions would generaly be happier and the next few months sader. It wouldn't be an extreme difference, but noticeable at night while trying to sleep. Since I started high-school (2019) every few ""cycles"" there is a period of about a month where I feel sader than a normal ""sad period"". I originally attributed this to the increased stress and left it at that. 

But midway though the great year that was 2020 I began having a small, very faint feeling that I just didn't want to exist anymore. This was during a particularly bad ""sad period"". This would cause alarm bells to ring in anyone, but I knew I wouldn't act on these thoughts due to my life philosophy. 

My general approach to life is to impact other people's lives positively, and to try and limit any/all negative impact. 

Now here is the main problem with everything. I will not tell anyone like my parents I have had any form of suicidal thoughts, because that would cause them pain, and if I did act on it, then they would feel like they failed and should have done more. It would cause them guilt that they didn't see anything before. I just don't want to risk them being hurt. For that same reason I can't risk hurting them if I act. So I can't do anything.

Now I have just left my current period of sad, so I feel I have the ability to prosses my thoughts a bit more rationally. This period felt worse, and for about a week I couldn't draw my attention away from the feeling.

But I might not be REALLY suicidal (like I said, bad order) because almost every time I imagined or dreamed myself jumping off a building there was always someone else there, trying to talk me out of it. This is what confuses me, and why I can't tell if I am really depressed/suicidal or this is just some twisted attempt my subconscious is devising to draw peoples attention to me.

I would never attempt anything currently, I don't want to hurt anyone around me. But I am just worried if the current trend continues I don't know what I might do.

Because I have no idea if I'm blowing nothing out of proportion I have not told anyone. I will not drag anyone else into my issues. Councilors would tell my parents due to the potential severity.


So to summarize, I might be depressed yet can't act on it, or I could be not and just attention seeking. I don't know if putting my thoughts here is also me just attention seeking. I just don't know.



Can anyone relate to or prosses these thoughts better than I can?

Am I mentally ok?"

depression,"If I die No intro, straight to the message on this one. 

I had a dream the other day. I was in a tall building with my parents, we all went to an event like a wedding or something. We were laughing and joking on the parking lot. We go upstairs on an elevator and get to the event. For some reason I had to go to the parking lot again, so I took the elevator again. The doors open on the first floor and I just see this beautiful young woman (around my age) with the most beautiful energy that I’ve ever witnessed. I didn’t knew her, but I needed her, no more and no less. She smiles to me and I smile back and I start a conversation with her. We both needed to go to the third floor (for some reason it was that specific floor), but the elevator didn’t worked. I asked if we could walk together and she smiles and says yes. We talk for what I felt like minutes… but in reality we have spent a couple months together! I could just not believe it. We still not found the way up… so I said to her: “hey, what if we just… go home?” She thinks about it and says yes. O know were both scared but we still start going to the exit and we go to the street as we head home… our home! 

We open the door, and our families are meeting each other because we were just married. I speak to my parents and she tells me to go to the bedroom when I’m finished. I end up talking to my parents so I’m headed to the bedroom, and she tells me to chill for a while with her so we cuddle in the bed. Then she tells me to check on “you’re daughter” just in front of the bed. I check on her and she’s the most beautiful thing I’ve seen just as her mother. We cuddle again. And there’s when it hits me: it was like I’ve had the Titanic in the chest. I’ve realized that I had as much as I could ever asked for. I had a beautiful wife, had a daughter, a home, family… I was happy, I had peace, I felt a fulfilled life. And just as I cuddle with her, close my eyes and tell her that I love her so i could be happy forever… I woke up

My smart watch detects my sleep. I checked out as usual and… during the REM phase my heartbeats went extremely lower than usual and i couldn’t breath. This dream, this dream specifically almost kills me. I think it was the last part, I was going to simply give up. I had everything I wanted, I felt fulfilled as I always wanted to.

I think there was a war inside me in that moment. The part of me that wants to give up ve the one that will do whatever it takes to survive for “something better”. And I almost lost. I’m not sleeping with the watch anymore so…

To anyone reading this: 

If I lose this battle against myself, do not worry for me because I was happy and fulfilled. In my last moments I experienced love, satisfaction and the peace that I needed for so long. I’m with the ones that I’m missing on this earth, catching up and taking care of my loved ones even from far away."
depression,"Citalopram effecting my fine motor skills Hey all, as the title suggests I’ve recently (last 3-4 months) been taking Citalopram. This is my first time being on Anti-Depressants. Anyway long story short, as an avid gamer I first started noticing my aim, reaction time and concentration starting to perish. 
Followed by troubles articulating words more than usual and now I’m noticing that other little things are perishing a little and it could be anything, picking something up only to lose it a moment later, troubles using tools efficiently, kind of fumbling on the keyboard rather than instinctively hitting keys."
depression,"Want to just hide Everyone around me is happy. I made a life choice to try and bring some happiness to those I love around me and now I’m a big depressed mess. Every time I go to talk to someone about what I’m feeling the conversation starts with how happy they are to be in a better place and thanks me for being apart of that. Knowing what they have been through and yes doing all I could to make sure they get to a better place, how can I ruin that? How can I tell them that their happiness came at a cost and every day I sit here sucking down all the crappy feelings. I know they would want to help me but it’s not easy to ask for knowing it will effect them in negative ways."
depression,"I feel like 99% of things are meaningless, immoral or just bad Sorry for the rant, but I just want to get it out and maybe get someone else's opinion.

I feel like most things are messed up:

* wealth inequality (fueled by technology, inheritance and corrupt politicians)
* disinformation and lack of education - from antivaxers, QAnon but also average people not really understanding science, biology, technology, etc
* high property prices in western world
   * for most places in Europe you need to cough up 10 years' worth of annual salary for a place to stay ([source](https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/region_rankings_current.jsp?region=150))
* technology fueling disinformation and mental health problems (see [Centre for Humaine Tech](https://ledger.humanetech.com/))

I just feel like it's very difficult if you want to live a 'good' life:

* want your own place to stay?  Need to pay interest to the bank.
* want to earn a lot so you don't have to take huge loan?  Throw out your morals and work for Facebook or any other tech company that's making money from sucking the soul (read big data analytics and advertising) out of people.
* want to live in a nice city?  Contribute to inequality by renting.
* want to go to somewhere not so expensive?  Then you'll face the following:
   * integrating in the society there as an expat (unless you only care about yourself).  Good luck if you don't have people skills / are more introverted.
   * potentially higher corruption / lack of jobs / longer commute (which leads to other problems)  / other hidden costs

So I ask... what other option is there?  How is feeling depressed about this an irrational reaction?

In any case, thank you for reading!  Hope you are doing well!"
depression,"Doctors are difficult to deal with (rant) I've been trying to get help for awhile now and recently I went to hospital and they helped me a lot in planning what to do. But since this morning my GP has passed me to a mental health team which then passed me back to the GP, I've been on the phone all morning dealing with this while I had a whole plan to discuss this with my GP and resolve all this but it seems no one wants to listen to me and the only help I get is when I'm in a desperate moment (being in the hospital). 

I just feel no one cares when I need help and only help when they see something has happened."
depression,I don't have anything much to say.... I just really feel alone and hopeless -\_-
depression,"Is what I'm feeling 'normal'? How do I proceed from here? Hello r/depression, 

21M here, I have been meaning to create this post for a few days but have spent sometime collecting my thoughts before I proceed, my primary objective with this post is to see if anyone can relate and whether what I'm feeling is 'normal' or something more.

For some background, I was a relatively happy child with my most fond memories being around ages 10. For some reason around this age is permanently burnt into my mind, so vivid where as everything else is quite vague. If I really think back this is most likely the last time I felt true happiness in my eyes, just after my father &amp; mother divorced so my mother, brother and I living together. Not that I personally feel like this had any major impact on me, just something to mention also.

Up until 2017 which was my last year of high school things were okay, nothing that would really stand out. Just going through the motions like most teenagers I suppose, by no means was I a social butterfly or anything but I had a few friends with whom I would play WoW with after school / on weekends.

February 2018 is when I can pinpoint the first time I felt the feeling of malaise. I remember it distinctly, sitting on the couch thinking ""wow this is really strange, maybe I'm just tired. should just get an early night"". My family had gone on holidays and I was home alone so I narrowed it down to just being a bit lonely.

\## There was some more background I was going to add, but I don't want to bore anyone and understand this isn't a therapy session. ##

Fast forward to 2019 / 2020, I started feeling this malaise more often maybe once or twice a month for a week or so. It sounds bizarre but I could feel it coming, my eyes start feeling heavy and I can feel pressure on my forehead. I wouldn't say I feel sad at all, I just feel nothing or emptiness. My father passed away in 2019 and I felt nothing, so much so I felt obliged to put on an act so other people wouldn't think I was a psychopath.

Still at the time, it wasn't too hard to deal with as it would go after a week or so, October last year they seemed to become more intense and longer lasting. To where I took up smoking pot again to help, I work and have a lot of study outside of work so I stopped as I knew deep down what I should really be doing.

As I see it now everything is so pointless, I don't enjoy anything anymore the only thing I really have to live for is my family and even then I don't really communicate. I just spend all my time inside my own head, an eternally one sided dialog to try and help with loneliness &amp; emptiness.

Even when I feel something, anything it puts me into a bad mood. Last time I can recount is walking past a KFC and the smell provoked some sort of feeling and then again I feel like shit. 

I don't even bother hanging onto anything for hope anymore, while studying I took a long break from gaming. What got me through was the thought of playing again, once I got there no enjoyment.

I think sometimes life just isn't for me, not everyone can enjoy or find value in everything.

Is this me being overly sensitive, I understand there are people who have it worse than me but I just can't shake this feeling of emptiness, loneliness, indifference, hopelessness.. I don't even know how to describe it, I'm supposed to live for another 50 years, I just can't see it happening."
depression,"Im just poor? Im 20 years old i live in California and i can barely afford to make rent to the ROOM i am renting out. 

I feel like im just poor because theres plenty of people around me doing very well for themselves with 5x my amount in bills and yet im struggling with mine.

I crave to live alone but i dont see a possible way to be able to afford a $1800+ rent payment alone, it blows my mind that so many people can afford that.

My life is doomed already, i dropped out of hs and i fucking despise doing anymore construction like when i look at the bigger picture my life is over, i feel like such a waste of a human, theres so many better people that could do amazing things with the life i have and im just waiting to die.

How did this happen 

i never thought i would be the 20 year old failure but i am and the reality of it is eating away at me.

had to rant a little ty for reading"
depression,Being hospitalized 3 times broke me Being hospitalized is like being in jail they take your freedom away and if you do or say anything they don't like they'll restrain you to a fucking mattress this has happened to me many times and every time It broke me more i was it the hospital for 9 months then 2 weeks then 43 days each time was hell i can't live with this anymore i want to die
depression,"Jesus Christ I want to kill myself My grandparents are gonna drug test me so I have to stay sober for 6 months. I feel like everyone hates me, but I have literally no-one anyway. My heart has been torn out a million times. I am incapable of working a ""shitty job,"" I am struggling to do the work necessary to get through uni despite having rather large ambitions. And I decided today I wanna try write fiction but here I am bullshitting and complaining on Reddit :("
depression,"Urges when things get bad Today was my birthday, and I couldn’t stop thinking about hurting myself. Had a horrible panic attack 10 minutes into break and ended up leaving my friends to sit in a toilet cubicle alone all lunch. 

I used to self harm years ago, but it isn’t a significant aspect of my life at all anymore. Now things have been getting really bad, the urges are here again. I’ve barely been eating, sleeping either 12 hours or not at all, only attending a few classes a week, being generally reckless on purpose.

It’s like my brain is on autopilot, I don’t have the energy to be fully present anymore. I’m exhausted, trying so hard not to spiral."
depression,"Life is definitely the hardest game ever And the most infuriating thing is that a lot of people refuse to acknowledge it. They act surprised when I feel hopeless, but honestly, how can you be cheerful and motivated when you keep losing ever and ever ? 

Nobody can find a game fun when they lose relentlessly despite doing their best. In such a situation, people usually rage-quit the game. 

Unfortunately, life is not a game one can easily rage-quit."
depression,"The voids keeps sucking back into misery no matter how hard I try. I, 24M am a fat stout(5'7) balding piece of shit who has a traumatic injury to the left eye and degeneration related changes in the right. Along with my childhood diagnosis of ADHD, for quite a long time, I have lost the will to live on. Can't hurt myself because it would hurt my parents but the desire to be alive and do anything worth at all keeps on lowering down further and further like drowning into a bottomless pool with light eventually fading out. The numbness is both painful and comforting at the same time.

I am in a field which I love and respect and can't complain having fared the pandemic relatively easier in comparison what horrors others have faced. Feels most the time I don't even exist. Just a substance less body floating through space goalessly. 

How do I regain this ever escaping will to do something, or anything with my life and actually feel something other than this mindless pain? 

It feels like I have lost something important a very long time ago essential for the desire to keep moving ahead and cant seem to relocate it."
depression,"Feeling Depressed All The Time Hello there,

I feel genuinely stressed all the time and i can't explain it properly as i am not comfortable about it but i can't stop being triggered by the smallest things linked to my childhood (one of them being WWE as my biological father loves WWE) and i tried to explain it to someone close to me recently and they said these exact words ""it's funny how i have depression and now all of a sudden now you have it"" and it's really cut deep into my brain today. It just feels like whenever i open up to people i consider family and friends IRL, they just push me away and then because I feel like I am melting, I end up leaking my feelings and thoughts on social media where it gets screenshotted and used against me and like I really cannot handle this stuff anymore. 

I screwed up my one chance I had to go to university thanks to losing intrrest in my college course thanks to losing my great-grandfather and I just fell so hard and if I am honest with the exception of a few months in late 2019-early 2020, I haven't really ever got over it.

Another thing that has made me angry is that imy coping mechanism for severe depression (eating) has now became my cause of it, it's fucking unfair and I am so fed up with it. I am 22 years old and feel like no matter what happens, i am always gonna be unemployed, always gonna be lonely and always gonna be living with my mother and never actually do anything with myself."
depression,"My psychiatrist is leaving me He’s excellent and will be perfect in the public inpatient unit but he’s been such an amazing support for me. I’m kind of in mourning. I’ve never had such an attentive and understanding psychiatrist. I’m a bit lost. 

I hope I can find someone who can be slightly as competent."
depression,"I feel so useless, depressed and like a burden to everyone around me, how do I continue from here? I feel like trash to say the least. I dropped out of university last year, I quit my job yesterday after only a month because I couldn’t do it anymore, I am severely depressed (about this and everything else) and it feels like everyone is screaming at me „you’re a failure, you can’t do anything“... and i feel like a burden to everyone. I’m 24 now and I have accomplished nothing since I finished high school. I’m so done, I’m on the verge of crying 24/7 and keep having nightmares. Everyone keeps telling me that life is hard for everyone and so on but that doesn’t help me, it just makes me more depressed. Can someone relate? I don’t know what to do. 

I keep wishing I was dead but I don’t wanna kill myself because deep down I still have hope that someday I might find a life I’m happy with. But I don’t know how to get there, I have no energy left in me."
depression,"Why is everything so boring, dull and meaningless? Hello to whoever's reading this. Just a little something about me:

HI, I'm Noah- I am 15 years old. I live in a place outside of a city called Manchester in the North-West of England. I don't have any hobbies, I just sit in my bedroom all day. Bored- wondering if this life is even worth living anymore. Where I live is dull and depressing. I live in a small box house, shit weather nearly all year round, it isn't particularly clean. People don't seem to have a smile on their faces at all. My parents are both clueless and don't understand how I feel when I gain the courage to come out to them about my emotions. The old activities I used to do no longer interest me. Gaming, photography, going to watch a Football team called Manchester City play, going on walks. I sometimes drink or cut to relive some of the pain but everything just seems black and white. Everyone else's life seems so much better than mine. Everyone seems to have hobbies, success, wealth, loving and understanding parents / family, very rare occasions where they're in a bad mood.

My girlfriend (Farrah) has helped me through my depressive episodes.

Just a little about her: She's 15 years old. She lives in the US, Tennessee. In a huge house with a large, loving/ supportive family. Her and her family is full of success. She has hobbies like basketball and softball, she is very sociable and understanding, she is going to the best high school in her state. She's very lucky to live the life she has but I think she just takes it for granted. She is so precious and beautiful. She's perfect to me. She is the reason I am still alive today. Sometimes, (possibly due to my depression) at an instant I can just- Turn off- even at little triggers or at random sometimes. I feel my emotions can sometimes hurt her due to her living such a perfect / ideal lifestyle. She already had a car by the time she was 14 so I guess that puts it into perspective how amazing her life is. We both live in completely different areas, we are opposites in personality so I just sometimes think she doesn't understand what its like to be me. When I cut myself. it hurts her. When I drink. It hurts her. When I talk to her about my emotions, she says it doesn't hurt her but deep down I feel it does- I don't want to be the one ruining her mood or life when it is absolutely perfect to me. I don't want to spoil that for her. 

I just really need help. I can't stop worrying about how I'm possibly affecting her. I need to find ways to stop making shit so boring, I just need help because I don't see myself living any longer with these kinds of emotions affecting me. I need a way to find the colour in life.

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Sorry if this didn't make sense or if it sounded rushed. I just wanted to get it out there and for someone to listen to. Thank you."
depression,Empty I feel totally empty ! At  55 wife ghosted on me  she keeps hoovering dropping bread crumbs my employer doesn't respect me everybody wants something from me but nobody wants to give everybody wants to take I woke up this morning feeling empty completely hopeless numb and sad! It just seems like nothing's going right in my life anymore. I've always been a caring giving loving person. I'm not suicidal but there are days that I would just wish that I didn't wake up and have to do with this world. My friends aren't even available anymore I don't have any family I have my dogs but my older dogs she's not well. I can't keep up on my bills I'm just tired and just really really tired
depression,Depression/Anxiety and Job My anxiety and depression is getting so bad that’s it’s making it extremely difficult to near impossible to work. I need this job to support myself but I can barley get out of bed and my constant intrusive thoughts makes it too hard to concentrate.
depression,I’m just unenthusiastic It feels like I can’t do anything right no matter how hard I try. Every year I tell people that l’ll do better with school but every year I just keep doing the same thing. It’s like this cycle of screwing up and no matter how hard I want it to end I simply keep going back to it again and again and it’s only after it’s ended that I realize how bad I’ve screwed up. I have people around telling me I’m making mistakes but I don’t end up listening when it’s most important. It’s summer and I wanna change for the better but I have no idea if one month is gonna change anything about me. I just think I’m gonna fuck up my next year too. And disappoint everyone around me. Every time I’m trying to have fun or do something else these thoughts of inevitable failure are always in the back of my head. I don’t feel enthusiastic anymore and I just want this cycle to end. I may not be as depressed as others on this sub Reddit but it’s really taking a toll on me.
depression,Do people ever get out of this endless loop completely ? Yeah it's my question and I am going through it too . I don't know what one week I feel so energetic and be productive and the next week I get too negative and stop doing things . Does anyone ever get out of this cycle completely ?
depression,"I really fucked up. My depression has made it so that trying to finish everything before I start college in the fall extremely difficult. I've been having so much anxiety about finishing forms and the like that I've been putting them off, especially since I'm having trouble doing them because I don't understand what to do. I had to submit a picture of my driver's license to the tuitions office by June 30th. I didn't know there was a deadline and missed it, so I won't be considered for in state tuition meaning I'll be paying thousands more. I really don't know what to do. I'm crying because I'm such an idiot and now I'm going to have to pay more when I can hardly afford tuition in the first place. I submitted it anyways in hopes they'll maybe accept it but I doubt it. I can't believe I did this."
depression,I don’t know how much more I can take I’m 29. This year my dad (late 80s) was diagnosed with dementia. Last year my dog died. I’m unemployed. My entire life feels off. All I’ve done is made mistakes and I’m scared to make any more. I seem to just constantly choose the wrong path or make the wrong move. I want to do and be better but I’m stuck in the dark. I take on more then I can handle then crash and let everyone down. I’m shit scared of my future but haven’t the energy or faith do anything about it. I don’t know what to do for a career anymore or what makes me who I am. I feel completely spent. I know depression is an illness but I can’t help but take responsibility for my part in anything that has gone wrong in my life. Then I beat myself up more. I’m at a point I just feel like I have no answers. I had so much potential and so many options and I feel like I’ve blown my future before it even got started
depression,Waking up early Does anyone wake up early around 4:30 or 5:00 I’ve been doing it for 3 years to cope with it and I like to be up at ease
depression,Hurting myself I’ve been suffering depression since I was 19 I’m 22 I feel in a deep state and lost a bunch of weight I’m underweight 43kg suffering body image issues and low self esteem I can’t get the image out of my head that my breast look huge when there not I’m c 14 there not big My boyfriend tells me I’m fine and is trying to help me get better same with family but I can’t seem to want to do anything
depression,"I'm now at the hospital waiting for emergency care. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 14 - so 12 years now. I was with my partner for 6 years. he never understood my depressive episodes. he often would leave me alone at night crying in the dark.
we broke up in April. I broke up with him because of his bad communication but later regretted it. he said he didn't want me back but wanted to be friends. I found out tonight he has a new girlfriend he started dating 2 weeks after we broke up. he said he didn't love me because I was told frustrating and didn't listen. when we broke up I lost the house we built together, our dog, our garden. everything.
my grandma was diagnosed with cancer in January. she was overseas and I couldn't see her. we were told she had a year left. she had a stroke after one month and died.
after the break up, I moved into a sharehouse. it was an awful place to live and I was living with alcoholics who would constantly have domestic disputes. 
I now live with a housemate, but I am alone most of the time. none of my friends live close to me. I have no family nearby.
my workplace is toxic and manipulative. they put too much pressure on me. they ignored my health issues and made me go without pay, even though I had leave. they fired my supervisor without notice.
I accidentally got pregnant with a rebound fuck buddy and then I had to have a medical abortion. it was the most painful experience of my life.
I am $10k in debt and can't get out of it.
I feel alone. I don't have anything worth living for. I try to be a good person, and I try to do things that are good for me, but it doesn't work. I am not worth it. I am not worth loving and I don't deserve good things. I want to die."
depression,"hi I am(12m) and life just sucks I feel like my dad is putting me in my room all day learning and I had no fun, I am working very hard but I feel like my dad is putting me in jail, I am very sad."
depression,"Giving my all while out of energy, and empty 36 (m) here. 20 years of major depression, GAD, OCD etc. due to bad childhood and trauma. I grew up raised by an alcoholic single mother who emotionally abused me, even when i was already an adult.

Now, I occasionally realise that I am out of juice and still trying my best to please and emotionally support my wife. She has bipolar (and BPD although that is well in control now). I work and study in order to better support us financially, since she can't work. I do chores and try to energize her to help. Today i sat with her at the kitchen table, eating food i had made just her in mind, and her silence and empty stare into nothingness just broke me. I suddenly thought of how I am fighting a battle I can't win, and that whatever i do is useless, she is not emotionally present and she will abandon me eventually. All of a sudden I wanted to kill myself although everything is ""fine"". Nothing I do will ever make her take the same initiative that I have or make her go through shitstorms to please me like I have done for her, and I will have to either live with this or abandon her (which is the last thing i want to do because she is very vulnerable). I wanted today to be a nice day for us, it is my day off and now all I do is hold back my tears and feel like shit.

Just today's thoughts."
depression,"Over everything! Literally. I am so stressed right now. I feel like I'm in up to my head in bills right now. Can't afford groceries for my daughter and I, rent isn't paid, zero bills paid this month. I have an Etsy shop that is completely dead right now and it's my only income. ( I've just finished school for the summer and I don't even know where to begin. My relationship ended this week and I feel like I lost the only person I had to talk to. I feel like a failure and I'm just over it all."
depression,"Time is going by too fast I'm 32 years old. It seems like just yesterday that everything was still possible. I was a young person with my whole life ahead of me. I was looking at some pictures of myself on holiday 8 years ago when I was 24, and it feels so recent. In another 8 years I'll be 40! I can't believe I'm half way between 24 and 40. It's so depressing."
depression,How to stop overthinking when you’ve never got anything else to do? I can really go from “I love my friends; I’m doing really well at college; I’ve got my whole life ahead of me” to “no one would notice if I dropped dead today; I’m doing well for my standard but not compared to anyone else; I can’t see my life going anywhere because I can’t do anything right” in a matter of minutes huh
depression,"Does depression make you sensitive to pain and other things? Ever since I had my current depressive episode, I find myself a lot less tolerant of physical pain from injury, and feel negative effects a lot easier by other people's words. I know that for people who had opioid use disorder, they become a lot more sensitive to things with their five senses. Could this also happen to people with depression? Physical pain hurt a lot more than it used to, and I find myself complaining a lot more than how I used to be. Is this normal? Anyone else experiences this too?"
depression,Crying I feel like I’m on the verge of tears 24/7 but I can never actually bring myself to cry.
depression,"what can a thirteen year old do with their life tldr: what can a weak 13 yr old kid do to help people

I'm almost done with middle school, im graduating in around 10 days. I'm a fairly smart kid, but get typically Bs and Cs on account of my lack of effort the problem is, what have I really accomplished? what is there in my life that I can really claim to have done? I don't have any sort of significant other or even a crush on account of being ace-aro, and i only have 2 close friends, but they are damn good ones. I'm short, I'm weak, and constantly dipping underweight, and my solution is to just eat junk food until I've gained enough weight. all I have going for me is above average math skills and being able to take a good amount of pain. I don't even have a hobby at this point. I spend all my free time playing video games for a few hours, trying to go to bed, masturbating to make myself tired and then passing out, while reaping no enjoyment out of any of it. I've been struggling with clinical depression for most of my life and im mostly just stewing in a pit of my own boredom and melancholy. I desperately want some sort of meaning in my life, but there seems to be nothing I can do period right now. I can't even get a summer job 'cause I'm too young. I want to help people but I dont know how. I'm not even suicidal because of my paralyzing thanatophobia I just want something, anything to protect or at least call my own. how can I accomplish that?"
depression,"i just want to be physically and mentally healthy this is the fourth time i’ve puked this past month (not from forcing myself, i get nauseous randomly and can’t stop it). i’m chronically constipated and i would probably not even poop once a week without medications. i’m literally a teenager and my parents didn’t have stuff like this ever. idk why this is happening. 

also i am crying over a guy i’ve known for nine days. i like him. why? what the fuck is wrong with me? how does this happen so fast? as soon as i find a decently attractive guy that treats me with respect and empathy i get attached and it’s so sad. i’m tired of hurting myself emotionally because of this. it’s my fault. i hate it. 

i have been clinically depressed for almost three years now and i just don’t feel like it’s getting better. i’m able to perform well in school and maintain like 2 close friendships but other than that i’m miserable and have no sense of purpose. my happiness comes in short spikes out of nowhere and then goes for so long and i just want consistency. 

also i’m extremely sensitive. i get so upset over things that don’t even involve me or loved ones and it ducks. like obviously empathy is good but this goes beyond that. i just get so deeply sad from issues going on in the world and it sucks. and if some random is mean to me on the internet it genuinely upsets me which sucks.

idk i just want things to get better"
depression,"I feel like I want the world to erupt into nuclear chaos, just so I can say ""I told you so"" and nothing matters. DAE get these feelings? In a way, it's like I want others to feel the pain and anxiety I'm experiencing. And then my disgust for the world is validated. And people can all feel as hopeless as I feel. Life means nothing, and I'm just surviving. (I'm NOT saying I want to lash out, I just feel like it takes something apocalyptic for otherwise blissful people to see the horror of the world which is all I can see)

I am legit anxious about nuclear war though. There's so much conflict in the world right now. All it takes is one blast, and then it's mutually assured destruction. I seriously feel like it's a clear and present danger, and I need to be prepared to jolt out of the city at a moment's notice. I should stock up on survival equipment."
depression,"Am I a bad person for scoffing at those depressed in Quarantine? I have an emotionally abusive family, am terrible academically, and have never had an IRL friend (only 2 online ones, both of which have multiple big circles and I'm neither's best friend, despite knowing one for 4 years) and a lot of the time I can't help but roll my eyes at people saying they're depressed and lonely because of Quarantine, because they can't hang out with their friends or family or whatever, but I know they'll go back to normality and completely shrug off their 'Depression' once they can go out again when lockdowns fade in a few months (hopefully), in a way I'm upset not at my life changing because of COVID, but rather, because it didn't.

Does anyone else feel like this? I know it's wrong to make light of misery and act like 'MY suffering is worse than YOUR suffering' but I'm a terrible person so I can't help it lol"
depression,"Just had the cops round So someone I knew online was concerned about me... they called the cops at 3am, now my mum knows about the helium and how I have actually been feeling,  did not want this one bit"
depression,"I refuse to believe I’m depressed I don’t honestly know what is wrong with me and every time I see or hear about the tell signs of depression it makes more and more sense but it seems I almost refuse to believe I am miserable because I believe I’m generally happy. (Never has the thought of committing suicide crossed my mind.)I feel practically numb sometimes when I get into deep thought, tired ALL the time no matter how much sleep I get, my apatite is reduced to only eating once a day or else I’ll get sick. Doing anything that deals with taking care of myself is a Nuisance wether it be hygiene related or actually feeding myself properly.. I’ve even lost most interest in my hobbies and I love drawing and writing, though I can’t find the motivation to ever do it unless I really force myself to. It feels like I’m on a never ending cycle of work, sleep, work, sleep. I want more out of life but something is stopping me. I also don’t want to lose my girlfriend, but I also don’t want to bring her down with me.. I know I can be miserable to her sometimes as well with my family. I don’t mean to be but sometimes the day hits different.  

I’ve seen doctors about it a couple times each time I was only told it was anthrphobia and anxiety, maybe seeing the wrong people? My family also refuses to believe I am anything but lazy.. but I’m always exhausted and not motivated to do anything unless it HAS to be done. It would just be nice if I could do more then work and sleep.. I have no friends and my relationship is long distance, what can I do? I even snapped at my girlfriend earlier when she suggested I go on call with her friends and her while they were camping- I immediately shut the idea down and refused to join. Why? Maybe I was scared, maybe I am a lazy jerk and mean. Or maybe it’s depression? Just really looking for some similar experiences.. I don’t know what to do. I just want to be happy and not mean."
depression,"I don’t know if I am faked being un-depressed or I really recovered...I feel pathetic After a time of receiving depression treatment, my condition got better. I have a boyfriend now who cares for me and I really want to try my best for him. But I still feel what I felt. I can’t get out from depressed feeling. I thought I was better but sometimes like now, I still feel extremely depressed and hurting. I’m worried that I would be burden for him and one day he would leave me. I tried to control my emotion but I still feel so so so sad, depressed and anxious. I’m scared that one day I came back to depression again and I would lose myself forever."
depression,"Help Ive attempted twice, the first time i failed and the second time someone stopped me from running into traffic.

I need a foolproof and preferably painless way to die

The only person that helped me, my old therapist at my iop, legally cant talk to me anymore because i need a higher level of care

I have the therapist i had before the iop which ive had for awhile but she just always doesnt seem to understand. Shes great, really. But my iop therapist i felt like was the only one to help me make those breakthroughs. I cant fucking take being without her.

No one around me knows what to say or what to do, all they do is keep me locked in because they are worried about my suicidal thoughts

Its driving me fucking crazy 

I just cant do this i hate feeling so fucking alone

I swear to god i dont care how long it takes ill convice them im fine and then fucking die

I hate this legal bullshit where im not allowed back to the iop

Like im supposed to be okay without the only thing that gave me any hope or happiness to get that thing back?
I don't fucking get it

Please help me"
depression,"Phone Addiction, no motivation Does anyone else have a crippling phone addiction? I always thought I checked my phone a lot, but ever since quarantine happened I feel like I’m glued to it. I check it constantly, use it during any movies that are on the tv, use it to do all my online shopping and bill paying, I even pause playing video games to check it. 

The worst part is that I get even more depressed while on social media. I seem to always get into arguments in comments with people and then I feel awful about it later. 

But I have no motivation to do anything else, really. I force myself to play games or watch tv. I barely leave the house, to the point where I get winded just walking up a flight of stairs. Every day feels the same, like my life is just passing by while I sit and do nothing.

I do take my meds regularly, but I can’t even tell if they’re helping me. 

Any advice at all?"
depression,"Hey everyone I don’t like to talk about how i feel, because every time i do I feel like no one gives a shit and I never really thought I’d do this but here it goes. 
 Ever since i was  little  my mom and dad always told me that if I saw someone upset it was my job to make them smile and to make them happy. so for the last 20 years of my life that is what i’ve been trying to do. It’s harder now tho, i feel like a sponge that sucks up other people’s sadness and then walks around with it. And it’s weird because making others happy is the only thing i’ve found that really makes me happy but I feel like i’m getting close to my limit. I’ve never been this alone and my depression has never been this bad and i really just need someone to tell me it’s going to be okay. I’m tired of being sad but i’ve honestly never been anything else and idk what to do."
depression,i'm scared of growing up I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 recently. I am scared of growing up and doing things on my own and taking responsibility. Suicide is the only thing that goes in my mind and I dont know why. How can I cope with these feelings?
depression,"Idfk I should be a happy guy,  I have my own place, a good job, a loving SO, but I hate my life. Every night I drink myself into sleep with a combination of xanax, wild turkey, aND high life. I constantly feel like my peers hate me as well as my co workers. Recently I've rebuilt my relationship with my folks. I fist fought my dad when I was 17 and let my mom wail on me with a ring on both hands at 14 (that really stuck) idk guys I think tbeybstill resent me for everything. Same with my peers thinking I suck. I'm a piece of shit."
depression,Has anyone here tried ketamine therapy? Is it worth the hype? It is very expensive. If you did how was your experience?
depression,"I don’t know what to do and I hate it so much This girl I’ve been friends with for a while is going to Korea to study abroad and I don’t have the guts to tell her how I actually feel and it’s killing me, and I’m really upset she’s leaving. I love her. We’re really close and she’s my best friend, and she had a family party (She leaves on Monday and we had the party Saturday) and even when we hugged, I quickly let go and tried to leave. My eyes started to water and I didn’t want her to see me crying, and then she said bye to me at least 3 times I think in an effort to try and get me to turn around and say bye back, but I literally couldn’t because I couldn’t control my tears and face I was holding back so much. Today’s now Sunday and I’m not sure if I should send her a message to ask to quickly meet up to get drinks (cause she still has to pack) and tell her, or if I should tell her I properly wanted to say bye or if that’s a bad idea. I’m so confused on this and even about our whole relationship. She means so much but I’m not sure if she feels the same way and don’t want to risk ruining it, or would it be better to do it now before she leaves and have this trip serve as time apart if things go south. I guess I’m more here to vent because I really don’t know what to do and don’t know if it’s a bad idea, but thank you whoever for listening to me. She has the smile of an angel, and not seeing it in person for the summer is going to hurt like nothing else has..."
depression,"Want to just relax Did work the whole day, just wanted to play some few games. But either I get tilted or my friends get tilted. Then I just can't enjoy anything for the whole day. Didn't even have a proper meal. Today sucked."
depression,"depression from school Hi i am a 17 yr old almost 18. I got severe depression. It mainly started when my family moved to a new city during the pandamic(about August 2020). I wasnt really sad about my friends being away because I talked to them while playing games and we would have a lot of fun. Then I started school which was online, the pace of the studies in online school was faster than i was used to, I tried to catch up but i just couldnt(I am in  Grade 12 so its my graduations year). I had a sevre anger attack somwhere around January when i was tired of doing schoolwork. I got on to play some games but my mom was in a bad mood so she told me turn off my ps4. I told her i had a hard day at school but she angryly turned off my ps4 and I just had a anger attack. i had never felt so angry in my life in that second. I took my controller and smashed it on the carpet, and i had this sharp pain in my heart and for a few seconds i couldnt breathe. In return my mom threw my phone across the living room and it broke. I went into the

little office right beside my kitchen where i studied and just cried for a while and the pain in my chest was getting more painful. My mom came down and gave me water and calmed me down and i got better. I shouldve gotten help then but I kept saying to myself that everthing will get better. I ended up dropping my Physics class and just focused on my English class. Now keep in mind that in my English class in Grade 11 i got 96 percent overall and it was a Pre-AP(Adavanced Placement) Course. This years English i kept getting 40 and 50 percent in assignments. And overall I got 30 percent. I never had that low marks in any subject in all my life. I was devastated. Due to the change of provinces my courses changed a lot. I made a High School Plan in Grade 9, for Classes till Grade 12 and now it was all in drain. I was supposed to have a really chill year for grade 12, because I worked hard from Grade 10 and Grade 11 for the last year to be a calm and chill one. People were enjoying thier spare periods while I was taking extra classes just so I don't have to go thru this pressure in Grade 12. Now i had 1 semester left to do English, physics, chemistry, social and maths. I made a hard choice of taking an extra sememster. my school counselor arranged me semester to be only English and Social which were the only subjects left for me to graduate, she also told me to finish physics work from where I left off last semester. I got a lot better after that but still mad at my parents for moving for a new job as it ruined my future and made things harder for me. Now what they started to do was close off the internet after 12pm so it would make me return to my sleep schedule which was really upset from all the pressure on my brain for this crazy drama. Now from there is when it all started again and this time it wasnt going away in one day. i had multiple fights with my parents about closing the internet, I would argue that i am almost 18 and i should feel independent and not like a 10 year old who needs to be restricted like this. they also have a history of taking away my phone at night from me, obviously now i didnt have one. I would try to figure out how they closed it so i can open but nothing worked. Now i started to have suicidal thoughts and I tryed making things better. And agian it didnt work, i was again doing bad in school and my mom blamed me for it, i tried to explain to her that i cant deal with school and i dont understand anything and she would just tell me to work hard and kept telling me that i dont even attend school and play games on my pc all day thats why i cant do any work. I would usually cry in my bed at night. And i just wanted to die or just jump off a building. I cant really tell my mom that i have symtoms of deppression cause she probably doesnt believe in deppression. i know that because i have a fear of deep waters and swimming pools where i cant touch my feet and she doesnt believe me. Now there is 5 days left in school and i have to finish half a term of work in social including 12 exams and a mid term exam, and in english i have to do multiple Essays and assignmnets. I dont know what to do and its guaranteed i will have to repeat the year. I cant deal with this stuff, a few times i had a thougt off crashing my car but i dont really do it. I have gained a lot of wieght, i am always sad and tired now, i dont remember the last time i genuinely smiled and laughed. i look back at my photos from a year ago and cant recognise myself anymore. And my parenst keep mocking me that if i keep up like this i wont be anything in life. This was the condition uptill now as i am writing this. Sorry if i made some errors in the post, its 2 am and i am having a headaches."

depression,I literally only have like 8 assignments to do and I will get out of school with only As and Bs. But I don't have the strength to do it. I have like 3 days. What the hell do I do? It's so hard. I don't know what I can do to get myself to do the work. I am so damn close but already out of gas. Someone help.
depression,"I need to vent 20M I have nobody, I’ve never had anybody. I’ve always been the one that’s there for everybody but I can’t remember a time where I’ve had somebody there for me, I can’t remember a time when someone has asked me if I’m mentally stable or just mentally okay. Ever. I’ve been there for everybody, practically raised my own mother and siblings, helped people out of depression just for them to use me as a stepping stool, never to be thought of again. I’ve been used, I feel neglected, I feel like nobody understands, nobody has tried to understand, nobody has loved me enough to actually look into my eyes and want to know what’s going on. But then again no one has ever known and will never know because I’m the light in too many peoples lives.  the only thing keeping me going is the fact that I know I have an out at any moment I want it. I’m a survivor of more attempts than I’d tell anyone. I just don’t wanna be here, life is just a constant up and down and I’m just tired of it, keeping my karma clean, dealing with everything accordingly, being kind, being compassionate, spreading positivity, staying positive, being strong for myself and those around me. But for what? To go through it all over again in due time? I’ve learned my life lessons and I don’t want anymore, I purposely break everything down to a life lesson so I don’t have to endure it again. The question is when does it end? The answer is it doesn’t. It’s come to a point to where I think everyone just loves what I do for them, I’ve never felt loved. I don’t have friends, literally not a soul, I don’t talk to my family for reasons, I have a girlfriend and a child on the way. Being how I am I don’t like telling people about myself because I feel it’s pointless nobody can help me but myself, I’m not somebody who’s new to this I’ve dug myself out of depression alone my whole life time and time again. Attempt after attempt. And I’m just tired. Realizing I needed someone I’ve been trying to tell my girlfriend/mother of my child but I don’t get it, everything goes in one ear and out the other, I’ve even brought up my depression upfront and my failed attempts to her, of course not telling her numbers but it still didn’t work, we never ended up discussing it, the only person I’ve ever been able to open up to isn’t here for me, she doesn’t care, she too has never asked about my mental state even with all I’ve told her, not once, I’ve always fixed everything with us, she’s constantly putting me down,  draining me ,has constantly threatened to leave me over little things, she’s one to let anything come out of her mouth with me having to push an apology out of her later, sometimes I don’t bother . it’s felt like she’s never loved me for me, it just feels like she loves the way I love her and I now have a child on the way with her. I’m tired, I’m confused, I’m lost."
depression,"Where you get emotional support? Hello, everyone  
I finally found public, that probably suits for my question)  


Currently, I don't have people who really understand me and can give support (I know it can sound too selfish, but still).  


After thinking for a while I concluded that emotional support should be the key for starting to work on big goals and acquiring them. (It's not mean that I couldn't create a goal, because of support missing, it's about the possibility to work on a different level in goal creation, e.g. create a company or similar)  


If anyone faced with such situations:  
1. How can you cope with missing emotional support?  
2. What did you do for getting emotional support?  
3. Did you eventually find this emotional support?  


Maybe these questions are trivial, but I really need to speed up this.  


Thanks, hope you have emotional support)"

I won't take my life tonight, but fuck, if I want to talk myself out of it, it will be like trying to get me to a specialist at a company?

Only reason it hasn't happened is because I know it will destroy my parents, and maybe... maybe my brother. That's the only thing stopping me. It's not a great reason, but a reason. Maybe I will create my own happiness in that time. Maybe not...

I can't work, because of that she left me, we're still friend, I still love her, she started doing only fans after we broke up, and it hurts me so much but I couldn't tell her, she keep saying people are sexual harassing her, but I couldn't do anything but just comfort her and listen to her, I can't even give her a hug since we're long distance.

I really hope I have the power, so that I can save her from her family and she can also stop doing only fans content, but I couldn't, because I have social anxiety and couldn't go work, she's in pain, and now I'm.

depression,"About nightmares Ultimately nightmares are getting so real and terrifying I can't even understand how they can be so real.

Last night was that in which all my past traumas and all of my worries really manifested through.

I vividly remember the dialogue between me and the shadow of my father.

""YOU ARE LIVING ON BORROWED TIME""

""YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE""

""HOW COULD YOU BE 28 YEARS OLD AND STILL NOT HAVING A STABLE OCCUPATION? LOOK AT YOUR SISTER!""

I can recall his face, while screaming the words I put in between the brackets, turning to smoke and ashes.

Sometimes I have a recurring nightmare about suicidal ideation, each time it is about me jumping off a cliff while riding my car.

I don't really want to share these thoughts with anybody. I fear they will take me to the mental ward.

I can't bear the thought of being alive anymore."
depression,"All of my friends are growing up and becoming boring. Is this how being an adult is? Im a 26yr guy and have pretty much had the same friend group since high school or even younger. When I was in high school and early 20s my best friends would always call me to hang out randomly and we would have fun all the time just doing nothing. We would play Pokemon go until 2am, watch scary movies all night, walk down to the beach while we gossip about boys or school etc. When we became college age we would spend nights drinking or going out.

This was all great until a couple years ago when literally everyone became so boring and old acting. Its like all of my friends are different people now. I understand that life changes and people get into relationships, get jobs etc. But I also have a boyfriend who I live with, have a good job, commitments etc. yet I still feel and act the same as I always did. Its not that I can't hang out with my friends, usually if I call them I can set up plans (although not even half as often as before) but when we hang out its so different. Now it always has to be a double date with my boyfriend and there's joining too, instead of staying up all night having fun usually around 9 or 10 they tell me they are tired and are going to call it a night even though its a weekend. It also has to be planned out in advance. Before almost every time we would hang out it would usually be following a random text asking what im up too or if I want to go grab ice cream or drink. Now we have to choose a day and be sure there's no work or school in the way. Im a spontaneous person but now I don't even bother randomly asking my friends to hang because I know it will be the usual ""Im doing blah blah blah with my boyfriend tomorrow or im too tired but what about next weekend?"".

Maybe im just refusing to grow up and immature for my age. idk but its making me feel so anxious and depressed about my life lately. Whats the point of life if its all boring? I find myself always trying to make friends with people way younger then me just because they actually want to have fun. I always find new friends who are 18-21 because our energy matches but at the same time we don't totally get along because they are so young. Can anyone here relate to this? What is your normal social life as an adult?"
depression,"This is far less emotional than I expected. Honestly, I thought it would be more emotional. I have been on verge of break down for quite a while now, I dropped out of university I hated, let down my parents, who let me know how much effort they have put in me and how I can't do anything right. But now I'm calm. I don't cry anymore. I don't feel anything anymore. I just want to die, plain and simple. No dramatics, no tears. Just a simple solution to make everyone's life easier. Including mine, you can't have problems in life when you don't have one, right? Bad jokes, sry."
depression,"I'm tired of being my worst enemy. I feel so hopeless. Usually, I act and feel like I don't care, but sometimes this feeling of guilt hits me so hard, and that anxiety makes me feel suicidal again. 

I don't know if anyone can relate, but I am my worst fucking enemy. I lost everything because of me. I used to be such a good child, only good grades. I was such a nerd, studying, writing, and reading all the time. Then, in my last year of high school, I couldn't hold it together anymore. I was feeling depressed for a long time (eighth grade or sooner), then in my last year of high school my relationship ended. I went to college, but I couldn't focus, and I didn't care about anything anymore. I didn't have a goal, and it wasn't something specific I could put the finger on. I just stopped enjoying living from a young age. Then, I think I thought I'm going to die soon, and I stop caring. But I didn't. I don't know why my instinct told me I was going to die at 20. But years go by, and I'm still here, unfocused, tired, sad, and anxious. The problem is that I realize that I lost so many opportunities, like literally just closed my eyes and pretended there's nothing out there for me and ruined everything. I could've gone so far, but I took some stupid, irrational decisions, and now I feel trapped, lost, and start to feel like I should've listened to mom, which is the worst feeling. Now I feel like even if I want to start over, I just can't move. It's like I can't get over my past, of how many mistakes I made. And, in my mind, I feel like I don't have time anymore. I wish I had a fresh start, but maybe being born again, cos I feel like I just can't fix this, ( I know, I ""feel"" a lot, sorry).  I'm so disappointed in myself, every opportunity I have, I find a way to make sure there's no way I'm taking it. Why am I doing it? I just can't stop. I do it in any area, but especially when it comes to jobs and a fucking career. I know I'm in a bubble and can't step out of my comfort zone, but my comfort zone sucks, and I'm starting to feel pity for myself. How can you be your worst enemy? I swear to God sometimes I just want to punch myself. How stupid can someone be to not want to thrive in life when opportunities come to you? Why am I a fucking idiot? See? That's why I want to kill myself. That's a good reason. It's like after high school, every single decision I took was the worst way to handle things. And I can't stop sabotaging myself. Love, jobs, friendships, you name it. I ruined everything. And the worst is the fact that I know how much potential was wasted. I just wanna disappear, make it look like I was never here. It wouldn't matter anyway."
depression,"I need help OK so I'm sad like very sad I always stay up until 5 and wake up at three  I have a small resemblance of a social life(one friend online) i have what I believe to ,be a eating disorder  I am full of hate and anger and I'm kinda a douchebag I admit so I wonder what's strong with me am I depressed.

depression,"Lowest sex drive you can imagine In the past year I got really depressed. With higher lows and lower lows but all in all depressed. Lately it has been even worse due to personal problems and I have to re-evaluate my whole life, since I think I might have done some choices that made my life harder. 
Also in the last year and a half I've had sex 4 times. I never enjoyed it too much, the last time was the most ok tho. 

But I remember being so excited for sex and ""perpetualy horny"". I have almost no sex drive, which holds me back significantly in my few dating attempts and even if I try it anyway and get slightly aroused, it's not the same. It's just not enjoyable. I hate it, that I literally can't have fun anymore in any way, I officially lost interest in everything including sex.

I also don't get excited for people anymore. I just hang around in my room browsing through reddit or instagram and waste my time. The last thing I can somewhat enjoy is food, which is also bad and I try to restrict myself, so I don't go overboard with it. 

Can anyone relate?"
depression,"I wake up with something heavy in my chest I’m still in bed and I wake up with something heavy on my chest. It’s hard to breathe. I don’t wanna be here, this is just so painful and hard. I hate pretending that I’m ok when I’m not. I just woke up and I’m crying, I don’t wanna start my day like this because it sets the tone for the entire day, I just wanna be in bed. I can’t talk to anyone about this especially my family."
depression,"Please take this seriously:Why quarantine isn't healthy at all? Guys,please don't stay at home for more than 2-3 days.It can cause you improve unhealthy habits and also lose motivation.(as far as i've experienced)

It's bc when you stay at home for more than that,you may begin to feel socially awkward,stressed and anxious and low motivation.As you continue spending your days like this,you may not be able to sleep on time(bc of lack of physical activity),focus on what you want to do,control yourself,calm down for a moment,achieve your goals,even remain the healthy habits that you've had.As a result,your life may change seriously(i guess we've all experienced this on the first month/months of quarantine) and you may just feel deep regret after feeling that you just wasted days,weeks,months staying at home.

Short words:i mean just think about the previous years of your life,when were you used to spend all your time at home,with no social connection and physical activity and fresh air and were still mentally and physically healthy and were doing well?

Hope it helps you."

depression,"Restless and feel sick Recently I had to go to hospital because I thought I had issues with my heart after a frantic 111 call. My chest was heavy and I thought I was going to die. I've had tremendous issues with alcohol, and I was honest with the doctors about this. Anyway, turns out (after numerous tests) that my heart is totally fine. 

But this was due to stress and anxiety, and depression. I'm so down about what happened, and I have friends who encouraged me to drink last night (they don't know the extent of my struggles). Today I feel sick and restless. I dont know what to do. My job is killing me, I'm burnt out and I cannot sleep. I've contacted mental health services and heard nothing back yet....I just can't stand it all any more."

depression,"I don’t know if I can do this anymore It’s a constant battle. These thoughts just never go away. I almost lost a friend because I couldn’t deal with these thoughts. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I just can’t. I’m hurting the people I care about for what? For nothing. For these stupid thoughts that won’t go away. They deserve better than me. Someone who doesn’t suffer from mental illnesses. I’m sorry world, but you deserve better than me"
depression,"I don’t understand why, after over two decades of severe mental illness that I will almost certainly not recover from, that I am still expected to “suck it up” and keep pretending that I am alright. I simply don’t want to keep doing this every day. The chances that I am going to “recover” are negligible. I am likely going to be in a near constant state of suffering for the rest of my life. The severity of my mental illness is such that I have pretty much no chance at even semi-decent quality of life. Why am I expected just to work harder to “fix” it? 

It feels especially cruel given how physical illness of comparable severity is treated. I am exhausted, and I feel like no one really cares - especially given the duration of my illness. 

I’ve picked myself up off the ground countless times and continue to do so. I force myself to work and pretend to be “ok” for the sake of others. Even so, it’s obviously not always believable and I think most people close to me gave up a long time ago.

I’ve been desperate for a very long time, and I often don’t know how to cope. I’ve sought out and paid for (at great expense, financial and otherwise) every type of healthcare I can access. 

What do I do? I don’t want to die if there is a chance to get better, but I am in my 30’s and my depression has only gotten worse, never better. I have periods of remission, sometimes lasting up to two years but never longer and every time it returns, it is significantly more severe and difficult to manage. 

I’ve been able to accomplish some things in my life, but there is nothing I can think of that makes the severity of my suffering “worth it”. I sincerely just don’t want to be alive anymore if this is what my life is. I’m not actively suicidal per say, but I also don’t know how to keep going and it has escalated to a point where if I don’t perform at a normal level, I will end up without a job or home in a few months or years at best. 

This is just the reality. It isn’t getting better no matter what I do, how many doctors I go to, nothing. It only ever deteriorates. What am I supposed to do? Is there a point where this is just a terminal disease like any other?"
depression,"Pregnancy and Depression - feels impossible I’m starting to lose hope. My husband and I really want a baby but I am on a high level of antidepressants for severe depression. (Zoloft, Lamictal , Lithium, and biweekly Ketamine infusions) 
I know I will have to go off those of the meds and I was told I could take different ones but I’m terrified that they won’t work as well. What if I can’t do it? 

Has anyone else had to come off antidepressants - how did it work out? Is it possible, because right now it seems like the scariest thing in the world?

(I know I have other options like surrogacy and adoption, but I very much want to get pregnant)"
depression,"Major episode, marriage separation, soon-to-be divorce, how to cope? Regular reader, first-time poster, in need of some kind words and support. Long one ahead.

Pre-pandemic, I had some mild anxiety, primarily surfacing in the workplace, that was well-managed through an EAP therapist. That anxiety took on a new form once the pandemic hit, as did full-blown depression, exacerbated to some extent by some poor coping mechanisms (i.e. alcohol) during isolation.

My wife and I married in late 2019. Things were about as great as they could have been, something straight out of a fairy tale. Don't they all feel that way at first?

I had my depressive moments on and off leading up to this past March, but we managed through them. The lowlight of this tale started with a fight at home that escalated quite quickly, and ultimately instilled a real fear in me that she was going to leave me. In my extreme low, and in an attempt to turn the focus away from the argument and towards my feelings, I threw around empty threats of self-harm. I would never, in a million years, harm myself or anyone else, but I needed something that would change the conversation.

She quickly left, for her own physical and emotional safety, for her parents' house. That night, the police arrived for a wellness check, prompted by my continued empty threats over text, and took me to the ER for an evaluation. They didn't keep me long. I was back home by morning.

Three months later, she still hasn't returned home.

In the first month or so, I would regularly have depressed moments when I would send endless threads of texts her way, some in sadness, others in anger or resentment, and others that were uncontrollably hateful or threatening. That only made things worse.

I decided I needed to get serious help. I spoke (and still do) with a psychiatrist, I upped the therapist visits, we did some couples' therapy, I've increased my mindfulness habits (meditation, journaling, exercise) and things started to stabilize. I've significantly cut back my drinking. I started on medication -- first Lexapro, which I didn't handle that well, and now gabapentin. It's no miracle drug, but it turns the volume down on the anxiety, which is what I need most right now.

We talk almost daily. We see each other occasionally, maybe a few times a week. We have good days, and we have bad days. The bad days are usually affected by my sadness, my fear of abandonment, and my regret. It's hard to put those feelings aside, particularly when the one you've hurt so much is right in front of you. She had planned on coming home on a few occasions now, but bad days prevailed.

Yesterday, ahead of a big gathering on my side of the family to welcome a new boy to our clan, she decided to tell me that she's considering leaving me. Talk about bad timing.

I'm not giving up my fight to get her back home, but at this point I feel like any additional efforts are going to be futile. She, and her family, all recognize that I've made *huge* strides since that event, but it's still not enough. Everyone tells me that what they saw is not the true me, that I was dealing with a sickness, and that I am a good man. But if that's the case, why even float the idea of leaving?

To use a school analogy, since she's a teacher, I feel like she needs to see an A+ effort from me. I used to be an F. Now, I'm probably at a B, but time for getting my grade up is running out. 

How do I deal with the sleepless nights of regret and self-loathing, knowing I can never undo all of this? How do I deal with the thoughts that, maybe if I were to just disappear from her life, she and her family would be better off? I feel like I can never face any of them again. Where do I go from here?

I suppose this may be more of a r/relationship_advice post, but I wanted to float it by people who understand the mental health aspect. Thanks all."

depression,"I need a way to see the world before I get old, I don't want to spend my youth doing the same things over and over again in the same town hoping to have enough money to travel when I'm too old to enjoy it. As I said in the title I need a way to get out of the monotony of a go to work - get back home and repeat life which may kill me. Is there a way to travel freely without being an expert in coding or blogging or stuff like that that allows you to work remotely? I'm 100% sure I'm not smart enough to make it and also it may take years to get a 100% remote position, so I need other ways to do that as soon as possible.

depression,"Uh oh 😳 I have this ""don't care"" attitude which I'm starting to see the double edge sword. It's great in a way because I don't care anymore (helps me a lot) but it's bad because whenever something happens NO MATTER HOW BAD, SLIGHTLY OR NOT I just go ""ok well it doesn't matter"" and it's just irresponsibility and a bad coping mechanism but idk how to probably use this mindset aha


Basically I'm either breaking down because I feel everything or I'm a mess because I stopped caring about anything"
depression,I just need someone to talk to. Please for the love of God I need someone to talk to.
depression,"Depression hides and adds up like and invisible weight on your shoulder I have been depressed since I was 9 years old. I first tried to kill myself when 10. I couldn’t do it in the end. but I just have been cutting a lot. nothing that was going to kill me though. Recently as in the past 3 months I have been great. I got all my grades to an A, I got a girlfriend, My best/only friend has been gone for a year and is finally moving back, I came out as bi to him. but just earlier today my parents told me they were separating. Now I realize all of those good things don’t matter. 3 months of no cuts. and today I tried to kill myself 5 times. Depression is like an invisible weight on your shoulder."
depression,I can't take it anymore. I want to go back heres my life story and venting I want to start from the very beginning. I was the first son and grandson. Always had attention while growing up. Family was working so i was raised mostly by grandparents. I missed my mom every second and cried for hours. Mom stopped working when i was 4 and i still remember the time mom said we will be together now. I was so relieved.  Had do start to school at age of 6. Kept crying because i didn't want to leave my mom. I wanted to stay home and play. This kept going until the 3rd grade when i got used to it eventually. Everything was ok until in highschool i had to work at a factory as a trainee. I was humiliated and worked hard and exhausting hours for a month. That experience didn't help at all. I cried in the work but was told to MAN UP and got humiliated for crying. I felt like the time i was in kindergarten. I wanted days to end. When i came home i snuggled my mom and cried. It was horrible. Just a month but it felt like years. Tried my best to get into the university in my hometown so i wouldn't be alone. Did it. Finished my bussiness administration school with bachelors degree. I had a life in front of me and i was ready. So i tought. Struggled to find a job for a year then the pandemic started. At first it didn't matter since i didn't like to go out. Found a remote job. Didn't pay well but i was home so it didnt matter to me at that time. Was supposed to work part time but worked overtime instead. And got paid 1/4 of the minimum wage. Got depressed and developed a panic attack. Had to quit. I feel like a dissappointment. At age of 25 living with parents and afraid of change. Took antidepresants and felt ok after a long time. I tought i was better after 3 months. Started searching for jobs again. Couldn't find. Same dude from the old job called back and i accepted. I wish i didnt even pick that phone up. I worked for 4 hours and after i was done i felt a click.. it felt like i was dying. Intense emotional pain. I was scared i was panicked i couldn't control my feelings and had to quit same day. I tought i would get better because i quit but no. I feel like trash. Im a burden. Cant live without parents. A literal man child. Im still on my meds but no help. Im scared for no apparent reason. One minute i feel numb another minute i start crying. I don't want to live but i dont want to die. I want to go back to my childhood. I want to be a kid again. Im not ok. Im not ready for anything. I want to go back to happy old times. Play with my toys. Run after a ball in the park for hours. I didn't thing this far. I didn't plan this far. God please stop this
depression,"Tired of life and emotions I cried when i went to bed last night, and im still crying when im waking up. I dont think i will be able to get out off bed today. I was suppose to go to my nephew birtday today - but i cant. My eyes r swollen and im crying non stop. 

I found out some weeks ago i have borderline, and r waiting for treatment. The last few days my feelings have been so intense that i dont wanna live anymore. The thing is, i would hurt my family so bad. Im feeling trapped. Im living to make my family happy, but i dont wanna live. I love them to death but im so tired. Ive had depressions since i was 14, and everybody always said «it gets better», but it never did. If a had a good periode in relationship, it got so much worse when it ended. I cant take all this feelings anymore. Im tired of living."
depression,Do i have to be an asshole to survive in this society. My parents are a bit overprotective and i live in constant fear of losing them which became unbearable after i grew up. I want to stay with them don't want to spend my life making maney for an asshole. I want to spend my life with my mom dad and brother. Whenever i want to speak to someone about it they tell me how they got bored off of their parents and living alone was perfect for them. They tell me they had to work when 8 years old. So what. Because i wasnt traumatized and didnt got beaten by stangers for money i cant function in this society. Do i have to hate people i love or dont care about them? I wish i can go back and be a kid again forever.
depression,"The Rules And Ideas I Live By For Staying Out Of Everyone's Way My depression is mostly rooted in the fact that I'm not good at being a part of regular society.  I am not a criminal.  I am not a malicious person and I don't hate anyone or feel any negative feelings towards anyone.  I'm simply just a complete idiot who has failed in his 31 years to successfully cultivate a proper life, a social circle, a support system, and anything worth being proud of.  

It just feels like everything I do and every decision I make is just a net negative for everyone, and that no matter what I do, I can't do anything right.  There's a line from the movie 'Hitch' that I live by, when Will Smith says ""I don't like to go past a certain point with people"".  At this point, I'm just trying to do as little damage as possible and hopefully find some little semblance of happiness away from everyone.  In a perfect world I'd disappear to a small, quiet town, and live out my days in peace.  Hopefully, that comes to fruition sooner rather than later.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Here are the rules and ideas that I reiterate to myself to keep myself based in reality, so that I don't cause any further damage to anyone:

**Disclaimer: These are NOT for anyone else but myself.  I am not advocating that anyone live by my self-imposed rules.  They are for ME and ME ONLY so that I don't cause any more damage to anyone or embarrassment to myself in life.**

1) Keep to yourself ALWAYS

2) Don't drink.  Nothing good has ever come of it

3) Leave everyone else alone.  They are living their lives.  You don't get to be a part of their lives.

4) Before doing anything that involves other people, consider how to do as little damage as possible.

5) Do not attempt to insert yourself into anyone else's life

6) Do not fool yourself into thinking you deserve to be in anyone else's life

7) Do your best to not affect anyone with your actions or words

8) Don't talk to other people for any reason than what is absolutely necessary

9) Do not try to do good.  You will only make things worse

10) Do not go above and beyond.  You will only make things worse.  You always find a way to.

11) Do not make decisions beyond the basics.  Do not improvise.  Do not try to be someone you're not.

12) Leave people the fuck alone

13) If you are absolutely required to be a part of someone's life, do as little damage as possible so that you are nothing more than a footnote.  

14) If someone has given you the time of day in any capacity, it's because they don't know you.  

15) You are not a good person

16) You deserve to rot away in your own sadness.

17) Do not try to be happy.  It's pointless for you and will only lead to disappointment

18) Never be anything more than a fly on the wall

19) Do not initiate anything with anyone

20) You are a net negative for everyone.  You are a vampire who sucks the life out of everyone.

21) Limit the decisions you have to make, because you always make the wrong ones.

22) Other people do not exist for any reason that has to do with you

23) If you have the choice, exclude yourself from anything that involves other people.

24) Do your best to be invisible

25) Nothing can change who you are

26) Don't ever feel confident enough to be a part of anyone else's life.

27) Do not try to get close to anyone

28) Everyone who gets to know you thinks there's something 'off' about you.

29) You are nothing but a bother and a burden to everyone you've ever met.  You leave everyone with an awful taste in their mouth and you have never been an overall positive to anyone you've encountered in life.  Everyone who remembers you exist thinks you're an awful person and you've spent your entire life doing everything in your power to prove that they're correct.

30) You can find happiness in things that don't involve other people.

______________________________________________________________________________________

This is what my flavour of depression looks like.  I feel this way because I've realized that I'm just not a proper fit for society.  I've tried and failed so many times and I'm just done trying.  I just want to stay out of everyone's way because I'm so tired of being disappointed and heart-broken over not being able to ingratiate myself into the real world."
depression,"Is there hope? For years, even pre-pandemic, I've really struggled to do even the most basic things outside of work- cook for myself, clean, check mail- it's like I can keep up appearances during the work day, then my brain completely shuts down and I can't even get out of bed. I've been avoiding that this is my reality for the past few weeks by staying with my parents, but they know nothing of this and I can't tell them.

Things have been getting worse over the past few months, I feel like I've completely ruined any chance of a life with any point, because I've let this go on for so long, and there's so much I'd need to do just to start unpicking, that it feels too overwhelming and pretty pointless to even attempt it.

Yesterday, I hit rock bottom. I'm in the UK, I tried to go to friends but for various reasons couldn't go through with telling them enough (they just think I'm a bit stressed with work), as a last resort took myself to A&amp;E around 8pm.

I spoke to 3 different people there who all gave me the spiel that I had taken a brave first step, it would get sorted/better and they referred me to a mental health hub immediately, I wasn't feeling great having to go over and over my failings, but I at least a bit optimism at this point that I get some answers or the start of a solution.

It was about 11pm when I got to the hub, I was exhausted from the crying and explaining myself previously. I went through everything with them again. They listened and I was told that they were sure I had 'classic depression and anxiety' which was an illness 'just like diabetes is'. A doctor never saw me but signed off on a prescription for 2 weeks of medication, but I was told it wouldn't work for at least 4. I was then handed a pamphlet and told it was all done. I've never attempted mental health help before, maybe this is standard,  but it felt like that could have happened hours before and saved me some of the pain of going over and over it, if that's all they could do.

At this point I'm hysterically crying. I know that none of this is their fault, and I don't know what I expected them to do, but it's 1 in the morning, just hours after I considered taking my own life, I have no support network, I'm going alone back to a house that's not really habitable (because I haven't been able to take care of it), I'm not currently sighed up to a GP (have been trying to work up the courage/mentality to do it for the past few years), all because my brain has stopped working and I can't function like. And the only advice they could give me is 'sit in your car until you feel well enough to drive yourself'.

Dark thoughts started again and I didn't feel safe going home alone, so I checked into a hotel. I've had to check out of there but I feel like I can't let myself be on my own, so I'm about to sit in a cinema. It sounds stupid but it was the only thing I could think of to do. Tomorrow, I'm expected to log back onto work and carry on with the facade I've built up, but I don't think I can do it. Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who might have been in a similar situation, I think I ned to hear that it's worth the exhaustion and shame of trying to get through the day hour by hour."
depression,"Unable to be at home I've found myself wanting to be outside as often as possible, be it an expensive trip or just a simple walk. 

When I was younger I was totally OK with staying indoors for weeks, and now I'm not.

Perhaps, some people would consider it as a nice change in personality, but I'm not sure about it.   
It's more like I don't feel at peace with myself anymore. Maybe I've stopped believing in that I could solve important life problems or trying to find my place in this world. Instead I just keep wasting money in an attempt to fill some void inside.

Does anybody have the same experience?"
depression,"I’m just so fucking mad I’m fucking angry, I have so much fucking hurt in my heart, and I’m trying SO fucking hard to just get back to a calm place…but EVERYTHING reminds me of it. I’ve literally NEVER felt this before, I’m so god damn sad, and it fucking SUCKS. I was doing so well, I was literally holding myself together SO W E L L. and now I’m fucking FUMING, I’m triggered. And I need someone on my goddamn team but no one is here. No one is willing to talk me off the edge. 

I fucking hate this, I just wish my brain would be normal. ):"
depression,"Is it possible for depression to vanish? For about 3 or so weeks I've been feeling different mentally and physically, like as if a weight has been taken off of me, for the past 4 years I've had depression and peaked about a year ago, I was constantly suicidal and didn't want to be around anyone and gained a lot of weight during that time and on top of it I felt horrible physically and was having complicated health issues. For about a year now I've been in somewhat of a haze mood where I don't feel much of anything, I'm not particularly sad or happy about anything just average I guess, about 3 weeks ago something clicked inside me and been feeling a lot different since, I've had a lot more energy to do things and my anxiety has toned down quite a bit where I can drive again, my mood has been more on the happy side and not feeling down or just empty. I've been feeling a lot more social and will even sometimes talk to people in game chats and even have small talk with cashiers and people I see on the daily. A year ago I struggled badly with socializing and always stayed away from people and only spoke to others if I had to like when going to my bank or buying groceries etc. My life itself is still in a bad spot as it was a year ago just this time I dont feel depressed all the time and have been feeling really inspired/motivated lately to get things done. Over the years I've never really had a normal life, my childhood was really traumatic and I feel it's affected me greatly in my adult life, I lost most of my family these last few years and dont even have my parents or anything, it's just me. I dont know what clicked inside of my brain but I'm happy it did as for years I've thought I'd never get out of it and now it feels like I have the chance to as if someone shoved me in the right direction. I've made a few life style changes this last week too and even finally starting my diet this week and even getting my GED. 

In short I've spontaneously been feeling great these past few weeks and feeling really inspired. I dont know what's going on but I'm all for it.  Any idea on why I feel like this all the sudden ?"
depression,"Medical treatment vs ancient therapy Hey All,
I am working with many people who are going with mental illness .but when we come to think about treatment we have two main way strem to treat 1st is by medicines and 2nd by different ancient techniques like yoga , meditation etc.
i use meditation and teach them to other because I use it on myself aswell as it work for most of people I suggest .... current I am going throw a case of a person who is taking medicine  for depression from long time but not getting any relief .when he practiced my meditation techniques he got better but he got attracted to medicine ....even he can control his depression now he still take medicine ....it really hard for me to understand and write his case study because I am not sure is medicines working on him or meditation .....
 Did anyone face this kind of situation or have experience like that ....further whats everyone opinion medical treatment treat it better or meditation?"
depression,Depression Anybody lost their subvocalization due to depression.  I can’t talk to myself in my head or read stuff silently and hear myself do it in my head.
depression,"I will never understand this I will never understand why everyone hated me for showing signs of bad mental health, if i was too scared to talk to someone i would be yelled at to ""just do it"" and get traumatized by the experience even more than i should or when i wanted to be left alone ""we're never gonna leave you alone""... So on and so forth.... 

But the thing that hurt me the most is being myself and then getting yelled at with the ""who tf are you trying to be!?""..by multiple people 

I'm not a person, a character or a human

I guess I'm no one

I am sorry for trying to express my emotions, my likings, my hobby, my personality, or anything human.

I want to shut down my emotions and live as a sociopath, i want to be no one but be seen as someone in people's eyes."
depression,"Today everything goes here What I want to do today is set out all of my shit feelings here so I can walk away from them.  I am anxious about work. I am anxious that I didn't follow proper procedure or that others will be angry at me. I am anxious I am not doing what I need to do, that I am not good enough, that I will be ""discovered"" and my pathway to stability will be taken away.

I am anxious I am getting dumber. That I am not as good at expressing myself, that my thoughts are all focused on two or three topics, that I am less capable than I was five years ago. I am anxious that I will remake the bad decisions of the past, and that means I am unworthy of the things I have. I am anxious that I make the lives of those around me  worse, that I am an endless blackhole of negativity and selfish need.

I worry that I'll always feel this way. That it won't get better, even if I change jobs, even if I get everything I ever wanted. That I'll still hate myself. I worry that I'm a worse partner, friend, everything because of the thoughts rolling around in my head. I feel like my partner is carrying me. I sometimes feel that I don't have the same feelings others do. Like everything is muted. I'm not worried about that. I wish the feelings that have broken through had not, and that I could keep my insecurities at arm's length like I did when I was younger. Except maybe that's a lie and I never did. I hope I can learn how to do that. To set these things aside and let them stay on the page.

Stay here."
depression,"Unable to find a job no matter how hard i try and ignore my emotions to get in just to break down afterwards... I'm trying too hard, i wanna give up, but i want a house for us, i wanna contribute to the relationship, but it's not working out and i feel like a parasite, a fucking roach. I went to so many places asking the fucking manager if I'm welcome to work there with no luck... 
I broke so many barriers of my anxiety just to be welcomed with more depression

I broke down today while washing dishes over this... I just ... I want a good life for us.

And yes i changed my paper job thing multiple times like everyone recommends, nothing worked out.."
depression,"I don't know what is this feeling. Maybe its stupid but all the time for years I feel that I miss something. Some ""thing"" that if I had it would give me happiness. I don't know what this thing is. 
No matter what I achieve, it is not enough for me. I still lack something to be happy and I don't even know what. it's so frustrating. 

I feel as if someone has locked me in a cage with a key that I can see all the time but that I cannot reach. every time I reach for it, it is too far only a few centimeters"
depression,"My family is falling apart My mental health has already been a low place and now it’s even lower, my PTSD is coming back with a vengeance and my depression is going on overdrive, my parents are fighting more and more and I’m scared they’re going to split up. My friend is in yet another toxic relationship that I can’t help her with and I feel so useless and done with life... I just want to die"
depression,"Office job is making me even more depressed Going to work after a 4 day break is driving me crazy. Office job is getting the best of me. Doing the same repetitive thing over and over again 8 hours a day's turned me into a zombie. I hate my job, but I need the money. So I haven't got much of a choice. I don't know what to do. I just turned 30 last month and I see no future ahead of me. I used to go camping and hiking a lot before Pandemic (I was unemployed). Now that I'm stuck with this job and not being able to go out venturing is just really hard to bear. I always considered myself as a free spirited person. I don't like staying at a place or working the same job for long. 

How do I keep going to work without feeling miserable? How do I overcome these negative feelings?"
depression,"Smile today please I love you I read your post each day and it breaks my heart even brings me to tears some days. Those three words some of us don't get to hear much anymore. I want you all to know I love you I miss hearing those words more then you could ever imagine. So today I wanted to tell all of you I love you and if your having a bad day don't worry it can't last forever, just remember I love you."
depression,Happy people Can't stant happy people anymore :(
depression,"i’m so grateful for my cat if it weren’t for him i’d probably be dead. every time i get a bad grade or when i feel worthless petting him just makes my day a bit better. even if it isn’t much, i don’t know what i’d do without him."
depression,"I thought about suicide last week. My life has been full of failures and disappointments, let downs and setbacks. Last Sunday morning I woke up at 5:30am and was just thinking about all my screwups and disappointments, and failures. Then the thought of suicide crossed my mind. I thought I could end it all right then and there. 

The depression that morning was so heavy and suffocating that I almost let it win. 

I think the only thing that stopped me from ending it was the pain that it would cause those family members closest to me. My mom, sister, and dad. I talked to a friend and that was helpful. Over the week I’ve started feeling better. I’m definitely not as depressed as that morning but the depression is still there. I still need to change things and make my life easier to live, not harder. 

Reach out to your friends, you never know how close they might be to ending it all. 

Anyway I just felt like getting that off my chest."
depression,"Reasons not to die pls Go go gooo

Pls 🥲

Also this could be cute for everyone"
depression,"LET IT HAPPEN! Am 20 old guy from morocco! Am suffering and struggling with social anxiety and I don't know how to handle a conversation with someone,even depression some times and those bad thoughts that come to my mind.the point is am learning English and I wanna see if it possible to use that to recovery from this shit and making friends to kill that emptiness! By practice with some native speakers or someone talking fluently in English. If you're interested and willing to me out pls DM and think about!"
depression,I just can't do it anymore. I'm so tired of everything. I have a test tomorrow and loads of incomplete work to finish yet all I'm able to do is lie on the bed. I'm just an annoying piece if utter shit. I'm a failure.
depression,"Its like life doesn't want me to be motivated or productive So for some random reason I felt motivated this morning. I wanted to work on one of my personal projects that I haven't touched in a while. Sure in the grand scheme of things it's a stupid little thing I started to pass the time, but it's better that doing almost nothing, just sitting in my chair or lying on my bed staring into space. 

But then my pc of course has to freeze several times for no reason despite never really doing that before. And all the while, half of my fucking programs want to update, and the other half just constantly crashed.

So I couldn't work on my project, and here I am, lying of my bed, doing basically nothing. No more motivation. I know no one's at fault here but honestly, why do I even try?"
depression,"Reminder You'll never know what happened to the people here. While you were supporting someone here, maybe your support didn't work, maybe the person you were supporting didn't survive and took his/her own life and you'll never know. That thought is depressing. Let me know you're alive. You're important! Just wanted to say"
depression,Can somebody please explain to me what a “mental illness” is or can me? Literally I don’t understand it and just trying to get a understanding or some understanding on it
depression,"How to deal with being negative and bitter, friends are annoyed A friend told me a while ago that I am very hateful and negative, this is not the first time someone from the friend group has told me that, it’s been a ongoing thing that I’ve heard for years from them

What am I supposed to do now, do I just bottle everything in and keep it to myself? It’s like nobody actually likes the real me, I feel like I have to put up a facade now :/"
depression,"The only way to grow in this society is to take meds I have OCD and was diagnosed with severe impulse control disorder. I have been in psychiatric treatment for almost a decade and am given medications to control my  emotions and prevent any harm to anybody.
I am thankful to the psychiatrist who has several years of experience in the treatment and has cured many people. May he live longer than me.
After several years I am happy to say that the medications have brought me to a functioning person though I won't say I contribute to society. I have a job( it a basic job and I don't earn much), a family and have what you would ""call a functioning life"".

I used to rebel against taking meds always critising other people, but I failed to see the real fault that is me. I mean it's common to have an abusive childhood, telling lies to save you ass, bullied by those whom you call "" friends"". These things are normal and the immature me could not understand it and "" trying to fix everything"" not knowing he is the actual culprit who cannot understand the society. I mean lies, betrayal, mistrust is common and it's normal. Virtues are things that you only see in "" superhero movies"". I have done it to others and you get what you do in return.

I have learned to accept this, and am really sorry for what I did. I have understood the fact that "" it's me that needs to be fixed""."
depression,"I need help but I can’t afford it Hi everyone... after many years and after guessing a lot what’s wrong with me, I found out I’m bipolar, it sucks just a lot, and it’s because of the genes or so, it doesn’t have a cure, so that means I will always live with this in my brain, I can’t afford a treatment right now and I don’t know what to do, I was the best student, hard worker, didn’t drink or smoke, sometimes I feel I’m good and this will never happen again but it ends up getting me, I end up feeling like shit sometimes... some days I just wanna die but that’s selfish so I can’t, I said I’d never but I started smoking, i feel unmotivated, low, I’m not paying attention at university, I just go into the class and that’s it, I like my job, but when I go home my life’s back, all the negative is back, and I don’t know how to explain to others, they see me quiet, not happy, and I end up arguing with them sometimes bc of it, I wanna just die but at the same time no... I’m just tired of myself, I’m so tired of not loving me, hating every inch of what’s me, wishing being someone else... wishing being better for others instead of stress.. wishing to my head to shut up forever and yeah.. that’s how I feel today.."
depression,"Ruined 5 months of no SH (TriggerW) I had been so proud of not self harming for so many months, i keep a day counter on my phone and when it reached so many months i deleted it, i was so proud of myself..

Then an ex who i truly believe now never loved me triggered a meltdown, he degraded me and himself, making me feel worse and worse, saying things i never said.. That i thought he was disgusting and horrible.. At the time i didn't abd i hysterically cried beside him as him thinking that destroyed me. I adored him.. I believed in him and had faith a good person was in him somewhere...

He broke me that night and i ran to the bathroom to cut myself.. I heard him follow me so i stopped as he asumed i was going to cut... That gave him or a decent person a chance to fix the situation with me.  So i got tissue and wiped my tears and returned to bed with him..

But he simply started again... I never once insulted him.. Or said anything harsh... I used to.. But this time i was just broken... And he degraded me to the point i hysterically cried yet again..

I went to the bathroom again, this time filled with no hope and completely defeated... I locked the door... I emotiobally surrendered and cut my arms... He broke me...

He destroyed my spirit.. He acted like he cared.. Then behaved like nothing ever happened.. But it happened for me... He brushed it away like most things in his life.. Then a week later he left me.. Even though i was understanding.. I was trying to fix things.. I was calm.. And he just dropped me like i was nothing.

He thought i was dumping him at first and degraded me for doing it online.. But i wasnt i just thought space was sensible... But then he did it.. He dumped me online.. I wasn't allowed to do it to him.. But he was allowed to do it to me..

That was the moment that the things he said about himself became true... The insults i never said rang totally true.... I stopped believing in him.. I no longer have faith in him.. And i don't believe there's anything good in his heart.. He will continue his games and find someone else to hurt..

Whilst i drink.. Smoke and stare at my arm... Regretting i ever let him hurt me like that again.."
depression,"My partner (25M) is depressed and I (20F) do not know how to help him. I have tried to be a rock emotionally, mentally, and financially. I love him very much but this year has been very hard for him and there isn’t much I am able to do. My life went back to normal after the pandemic, if anything it’s going quite well and I believe he has started to resent me because he has been struggling. I have given him a home, helped with his bills, helped take care of his child, and been there for emotional support. Our lease is up and my father offered to have us stay with him but my boyfriend refuses. So now he is saying he is going to be homeless, doesn’t have a job or any money and he cannot see his kid everyday the way he wants to. He said he has nothing to live for. He is threatening to kill himself, and he has been saying it for a while. I’m worried he actually will do it.

Over the last few months he has been borderline emotionally and verbally abusive, saying he hates me, wishes my mom and I were dead, wishes he had never met me and cannot wait to never see my face again. He has threatened to break up/leave me multiple times (he lives with me). He even said that he would kill himself in front of me so I would “get it”. He later says he doesn’t mean it. I know he is just in deep pain and is lashing out at the only person he feels comfortable communicating his pain to (ME). Everyone has told me to leave and that I am in over my head, but I love him. If anything ever happened to him I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself for leaving him alone. I feel like I am drowning and I know I am unhappy, I just want my old boyfriend back. 

He said if I ever called the authorities he would never forgive me and he would just kill himself when he got out. And I know if he didn’t end up killing himself he would still be deemed unfit to see his child. I love him so much and I myself was baker acted as a teenager so I know first hand how that can fuck you up. I just want him to be happy. I don’t want to hurt him further. But I also don’t want him to hurt himself. I have encouraged him to reach out to his friends and family but I don’t believe he has.

What should I do? Do I have to report it (legally). I don’t know what to do anymore."
depression,"How can I be an advocate for people with mental illness? 29 F, Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder

I am currently on an upswing and I'd like to become an advocate for mental health in my community, but I don't know where to start. The only opportunity that I am aware of is volunteering for a suicide hotline but I don't know that I'm quite ready for that yet. I am great at meeting people and public speaking and I am able to form connections with almost anyone and I'd like to use my experience with mental health to help others.

Thank you!"
depression,"Notice Im pretty sure, if i died in my sleep, no one would notice for a couple days. I could be dead in my bed, and not a single person would realize anything happened to me for at least 2 days, if not more."
depression,"Don't know what to do. So I am not sure what is wrong with me, just know that there is something wrong. 

Here is what I have been feeling.
I feel tired a lot, I don't seem to enjoy doing much other than watching a show and sleeping, I feel like because I don't enjoy anything that I won't ever find a purpose or a career. I just don't feel motivated to do anything.

I watch a couple shows but even then I really only get attached to one and then when it ends I get more sad. I have friends but I have had covid and missed out on my last weeks of school. Now we will be graduating and I am afraid that we won't see each other much.

I have so much but feel so little. I used to enjoy videogames but my enjoyment there is fading. I enjoy music and I used to try and play a lot but I can't learn what I want as far as playing instruments so I am starting to lose interest there. I have so much stuff that I used to like or still kinda do but don't actually do them or enjoy them. I tend to give up like with music. I just find it too hard to learn theory or practice certain things. I don't know how to do any of it.

I don't usually vent about this to my friends and I had one that I used to tell everything to but she recently stopped talking to me for a stupid reason and so now I have lost the only person to vent to. I am avoiding being in a relationship for that reason too because I don't want to start a relationship and then bombard her with all this shit. 

I don't know what to do, my friends tell me ""oh its ok"" or ""oh yeah I experience that sometimes too"" but I don't care how many other people experience it or that I am not alone, that doesn't help with the fact that I am struggling with it."
depression,"My therapist tells me that i need new friends and a girlfriend but i have no clue how to get that I do have a couple friends but they are not that kind of friend you know the one that text you and go out and do friends stuff, i think the right word would be a ""close"" friend, the kind of friend that is always there i guess, i think i know what my therapist means with getting new friends, going out and socialize and all of that, basically stop being lonely lol

Same thing with a girlfriend, it's been a while since i had one, like 5 years, i have tried getting another but it just never works and im tired of it, probably heartbroken but im just not interested in that anymore, i wish i had one, i miss all the hugs and cuddles and all of that stuff but yeah I've tried and it's not working so im gonna stop trying and focus on something else

But yeah i get it, i should be doing all that stuff, i should be living my life and im too young to focus on boring stuff, but i really have no idea where to search for new friends and possibly a girlfriend, i have tried tinder and dating apps but again it never really worked so i stopped doing it and i don't think im going there again, also im not in optimal mental/physical condition to do that i think there's more important things to fix"
depression,"I think i'm going to kill myself today I just end my high school and i can't see myself in job or uniwersity. My parents say that i don't have any other options. Because of my deppresion i often can't go out of the bed and i get tired very quicly and because of that my parents and teachers say that i won't be able to do that at work or university. I think thers no other options for me other than just kill myself. I'm sure that even if some People would cry after me they soon get over it. Today is the first time ever i stay in house by myself, my parents heve to go take care of my grandmother. I stay becouse i say i already make plans with my friend. I wasn't lying, but my friend write mi that she can't go out today because shes sick. So i think that i will do it when my parents go out. I don't know if i realy want to, but i don't see any other options."
depression,i just want to be present i want to stop  thinking about whats going to happend 1 2 5 years from now on. i want to enjoy the moments of the present rather than giving myself anxiety thinking about the future or the past :(
depression,"dont read this i have every reason and excuse to be depressed but i put my self-defeating pity party thought patterns on the back burner for the sake of earning money and being successful. but now and then in the quiet of the morning i feel the despair and rage. this is a universal experience that i'm sure many people can empathize with. 

i made a couple good investments a couple years ago and now i am wealthier than i ever imagined i could be, but i'm still often preoccupied with childhood traumas and trapped within things of that nature. within me is a bottomless and deep rage that i keep under wraps with alcohol, sex, and general distractions but i fear for the day when the coping mechanisms no longer work. thanks for reading this."
depression,"Do you think its feeling completely defeated after the smallest of setback/ inconvenience/ remark that proves to you that your system is indeed just depressed? Some may call it hypersensitivity, but in my situation for instance- there is someone asking me for a sum of money that I know they don't deserve/have earned. (also asked for it in cash , so already it shows they want it off the books)

Even though I know I am in the right I am feeling really anxious about the confrontation soon, my intention was to ask to breakdown the costs/ say how its too steep for what i got / is daylight robbery lol (basically am getting charged for a service I didn't even avail of)

In addition to this, any mean remarks/ comments from my family just throws me into the gutter. It's like it sucks any remaining energy left and I just crash on my bed wanting to sleep forever. They know how I'm feeling as I am in the midst of a mental breakdown after 4 years of denial how I was feeling and numbing myself with binge watching/eating or either getting dismissed by so called mental health professionals, (for either being too severe to be able to help me or not severe enough to be able to help me) .  I also have the bad habit of replaying unhappy events in my life or even smug remarks from shits laughing at me at school, whom knew nothing of my circumstances- I'm 21 now and hindsight is 20/20 and I acknowledge a lot has happened in my teens so I should cut me some slack for having 0 motivation/ being perceived to be dopey I realize my system was still depressed!!!!

I also find it hard to even be happy over actual positive things - like getting predicted grades in my country to progress to 3rd level. My lack of happiness over such potential good things like a real opportunity of actually getting accepted into  a college makes me just realize how much I must be depressed and in a sad negative head space.

 I think get real anxious about 3rd level as I have a fear thinking if i couldn't handle 2nd level how am I meant to handle 3rd level material, and have the motivation to do so? ?? I wouldn't mind i know EXACTLY what I want to do with my life, I just find it hard to get out of bed or actual concentrate , so obviously my system doesn't match with my true self .  Took literally 5 years to realize this is what it is cause i thought I was a motivated person as I had ambition :(((

All underneath this I feel like my true self is a bad bitch even over the past 10 years there has been a no. of times where I felt genuinely happy, although the vast majority of perceived happiness (smiling, laughing and bublineess was just over compensation) I genuinely feel like Robbin William. I also feel like I am just hidden under layers of depression and anxiety right now, and the isolation isn't helping me. 

Just want to be happy. I will never ever forget the way my family have treated me in this situation and I will be sure to keeo my distance in future when i overcome this hopefully as i dont want 2 be like thd\]is forever"
depression,"I think I might be depressed. Or I am lazy as hell and completely fucked up. I think I am a lost cause. I have no idea what I want to do in life or what courses I want to take in college. My parents clearly want me to be a doctor. I don’t think I am capable of that, at least I dont \*want\* to. I can’t focus on studies anymore, my grades are worse than ever. My parents are disappointed in me and keep scolding me for everything, all the time. Calling me useless, half wit, dumb, lazy etc etc. 

I told them I don’t wanna do it but they won’t listen. It’s “family honor” we’re talking about. Must become a doctor, anyhow. They say I’m not depressed, only lazy and rebellious and stupid. They say I am not depressed, but it’s only a fake excuse to not work.

I don’t want to do anything anymore. Except sleep and watch movies. 

I have no idea what to do. I hope this is rock bottom, because if I go anymore deeper, I won’t be able to tolerate it anymore."
depression,"Am I always going to feel so alone? I long for days in the future where I’m not plagued by my mistakes.
I hope that some day, I’ll feel alright before I go to sleep.
I wish for someone who can connect with me and understand my loneliness.
I want to be understood, no catharsis can be obtained in a life where you walk around feeling like you don’t belong at any place with anyone.
I suffer just from waking up, living with myself is the truest waking nightmare."
depression,"I am tired. I am tired of this life. Working at the job i dont like. Trying to make everyone happy, and acting like i am happy.

depression,I am depressed I am stuck with my life. I want to succeed. But it's taking too much of me. I am losing again and again. I am sad. I don't have energy.
depression,"i just wanna talk dont know if this belongs here but i wanna rant lol.

ive seen posts that r like “i dont wanna know whats up i wanna talk abt the universe” or some shit like that and honestly im sick of it. because i do wanna know whats up. i want to talk about the most mundane things like terrible movies and i do want to know about the meme you saw this morning that made you happy just a little bit. 

i think in order to really talk and i mean fucking talk, you need to be able to talk about the most mundane things too. i find that the lost that affects me the most is the one where its the person i can talk abt the dumbest shit to leaving.

i dont care if it’s not what you read in romance novels or if its nothing like the conversations you read in books written by fucking tolstoy or whatever, i just want to have a laugh and not think about my existence and what it means to be human for a little bit."
depression,"I don't know what to do. I'm going to fail most of or all of my classes in uni tomorrow. First off, I couldn't give a crap about my university grades. I do not for a second believe that a degree will help me where I'm going. I have some pretty good talents in a field people are still mostly naive about and I have an artistic vision that I believe is pretty strong in another field I want to pursue. Most of the famous and accomplished people in that field/industry I want to work in either didn't finish college or didn't go to it. So, I'm only attending college now for emotional enrichment, emotional independence, and because my father wants me to. That brings me to my next point.

My dad is unfortunately a very conservative, harsh and traditional person. He absolutely reviles his own generations for the sex and lsd. He thinks all democrats are evil communists. He hates gay people and trans people and thinks that gay people should be treated for their disorder ""but the democrats got rid of mental care for these gay people."" 80% of the words that come out of his mouth are disparaging about some type of groups of people. Like ""Oh that girls a slut. Look at those awful tattoos."" or ""these gay retards are blah blah blah."" He's like a toxicity machine but he doesn't realize it because he still believes that I agree with all the batshit insane garbage he spews. Spoiler, I don't. My father hates the world. He hates most people. But I still love him. He's an incredibly hard worker and he's been screwed over so many times in his life that I understand his anger. But it doesn't change the fact that he is an intimidating and slightly manipulative person. I personally think he's an emotionally abusive person but I can't confirm if he falls in that group. 

I didn't want to go to college after high school. High school was the worst 4 years of my life and I wanted to take a year and 2 summers to relax and not deal with any assignments or tests. I wanted to get a job and start making a small amount of money in addition to getting work experience. The last thing in the world that I wanted was to go straight into college after HS but alas that is what happened. However, in college, the first semester at least, I started to feel very happy and non stressed out now that I was about 2 hours away from him. I never had, and still never have, done any type of drugs or had sex. But just the separation and the calm felt so nice. I enjoyed my first semester. And halfway into my second semester, covid hit and everything went online. That's where everything started to fell apart. I have had 3 bad semesters in a row. A year and a half of low grades, barely escaping academic suspension, and covid grade. Now it looks like things will finally be back to in person classes coming this fall.

This semester has been my worst. I haven't done a majority of the work. I have been depressed. I have been ""attending class"" this entire year in this house where he is the only other person. It has taken a toll on me a little bit. I just stopped doing the work. I didn't feel compelled to do it. I then said to myself ""Oh, I'll do the late work tomorrow."" But then late work built up and I got into the headspace that I can't finish the recent late work until I submitted the older late work. But I never did either. Tomorrow's my last day of finals. I have accepted the failure and plan on zeroing out all my grades with Covid grades and starting small next semester. Again, I don't care much for college. I just want to go back to that down again. It's such a nice place and my life was calm away from my dad. I was infact so un stressed that I began losing weight like crazy. I just felt good. Again. I love my father. If he were to die I would be sad. He's been dealt a real shitty hand in life and I want to find a way to be supportive of him but also not actually have to deal with him. Living in a dorm 2 hours away seemed to fit that nice balance.

What I'm leading to is this. I fear what he thinks of me and I fear his intimidating talks with me. I don't want to talk to him about my grades. I just fucking don't. I am actively contemplating faking me grades using various means including editing the html of a page and faking my future schedule. I don't care about my grades. HE DOES. I don't know what to do. And for anyone saying ""Oh just tell him the truth. Parents will understand."" Not this parent. This guy has the sensibilities and expectations of someone from the 1950s. He is not understanding. I don't know if I should still just tell him the truth and endure the most likely angry talk he'll have with me or if I should just lie to him."
depression,"We’re all f**ked A lot of nights i scroll through different subreddits. This being one of them. So many people need help and not even one person replies to a post 90% of the time.

I reply to some people in hopes to helped them feel at-least a tiny bit of joy knowing someone took the time to read what they had to say and respond to them.

I know some people come here and vent.
But we really are f*cked. No one to talk to and no help to get us to move forward. At the end of the day it’s us all alone. Regardless of how many people are willing to help us. Don’t even know what I’m saying. But f*ck im tired of feeling like this. 

The only way of it to finally end it is to end it all."
depression,"Lost my Best Friend...? I still don’t hesitate to call him my best friend, but to be honest we’ve barely spoken in the last few months. He told me that he couldn’t talk to me about my depression anymore because he was dealing with his own, and then things just kind of fell off from there. I know we deal with our depression in different ways, but his way of avoiding talking about it just kills me.

He was my confidant, someone I could talk to about cutting myself without feeling judged, someone I could cry to over the phone, someone who convinced me to get medication, to go see a therapist, and now he’s just... gone. I can’t explain how utterly alone I feel now. How I reach for my phone to send him a message when I needed a melatonin to sleep, but put it back down when I know he doesn’t want to hear my shit anymore.

And the other part is I’m so worried about him - is he getting enough food, getting outside, is he getting help, medication, sleep, and yet I can’t ask him any of these things anymore, but I’m just so goddamn worried out of my for him.

So how can I lean on *anyone* if my best friend can just vanish like that? My therapist tells me to have faith in my friends but all I see is them dropping off when they’ve had enough of my shit.

I’m just so fucking tired of having to try everyday. I go to sleep pleading the universe to not wake me up."
depression,i have a lot of issues i know i’m all kinds of screwed in the head but honestly i just crave acceptance and love. my self-destructive behavior is probably the result of deprivation from it and i am aware of that.

depression,"Depression as an Abaissement du niveau mental and how to cope with it .  

Cognitive decline and depression are an Abaissement du niveau mental , the cause of the depression might be due to something repressed drawing the psychic energy form conscious and lowering the cognitive functions , causing an introversion of the libido (psychic energy) .

DR Carl Jung the swiss psychiatrist writes :

"" It is a slackening of the tensity of consciousness, which might be compared to a low barometric reading, presaging bad weather. The tonus has given way, and this is felt subjectively as listlessness, moroseness, and depression. One no longer has any wish or courage to face the tasks of the day. One feels like lead, because no part of one's body seems willing to move, and this is due to the fact that one no longer has any disposable energy. This well-known phenomenon corresponds to the primitive's loss of soul.

.... Abaissement du niveau mental can be the result of physical and mental fatigue, bodily illness, violent emotions, and shock, of which the last has a particularly deleterious effect on one's self-assurance. The abaissement always has a restrictive influence on the personality as a whole. ....""CW9

""the future appears hopeless and empty. But what robs Nature of its glamour, and life of its joy, is the habit of looking back for something that used to be outside, instead of looking inside, into the depths of the depressive state. This looking back leads to regression and is the first step along that path. Regression is also an involuntary introversion in so far as the past is an object of memory and therefore a psychic content, an endopsychic factor. It is a relapse into the past caused by a depression in the present.

Depression should therefore be regarded as an unconscious compensation whose content must be made conscious if it is to be fully effective. This can only be done by consciously regressing along with the depressive tendency and integrating the memories so activated into the conscious mind—which was what the depression was aiming at in the first place"" Jung CW 5

""My patient was a very clever young man who had been intellectually enlightened as to the cause of his neurosis by a lengthy analysis. However, intellectual understanding made no difference to his depression. In cases of this sort the doctor should spare himself the useless trouble of delving still further into the causality; for, when a more or less exhaustive understanding is of no avail, the discovery of yet another little bit of causality will be of no avail either. The unconscious has simply gained an unassailable ascendency; it wields an attractive force that can invalidate all conscious contents—in other words, it can withdraw libido from the conscious world and thereby produce a “depression,” an abaissement du niveau mental (Janet). But as a result of this we must, according to the law of energy, expect an accumulation of value—i.e., libido—in the unconscious.

Libido can never be apprehended except in a definite form; that is to say, it is identical with fantasy-images. And we can only release it from the grip of the unconscious by bringing up the corresponding fantasy-images. That is why, in a case like this, we give the unconscious a chance to bring its fantasies to the surface. .... It is characteristic of the nature of the unconscious psyche that it is sufficient unto itself and knows no human considerations.

Once a thing has fallen into the unconscious it is retained there, regardless of whether the conscious mind suffers or not. The latter can hunger and freeze, while everything in the unconscious becomes verdant and blossoms.

So at least it appears at first. But when we look deeper, we find that this unconcern of the unconscious has a meaning, indeed a purpose and a goal. There are psychic goals that lie beyond the conscious goals; in fact, they may even be inimical to them. But we find that the unconscious has an inimical or ruthless bearing towards the conscious only when the latter adopts a false or pretentious attitude

...when a fit of depression comes upon him, he must no longer force himself to some kind of work in order to forget, but must accept his depression and give it a hearing. Now this is the direct opposite of succumbing to a mood, which is so typical of neurosis. It is no weakness, no spineless surrender, but a hard achievement, the essence of which consists in keeping your objectivity despite the temptations of the mood, and in making the mood your object, instead of allowing it to become in you the dominating subject.

So the patient must try to get his mood to speak to him; his mood must tell him all about itself and show him through what kind of fantastic analogies it is expressing itself"" Jung CW 7"
depression,"Sadness won't go way I am so fucking depressed. I am actually realising it for the first time in my life.

I don't even know why I'm typing this out on this sub.  There's nothing anyone could say to make me feel better. 

I fucking love my Mom."
depression,"I am so tried of judging people or being judged Idk if it counts as depression, everyday people ""force"" me to judge other people,

like my friends would send other friend's selfie to me and bad-mouth their appearance and clothes,

colleague would criticize other colleague's decision(like car's color

Hearing these things everyday makes me feel exhausted.

It also makes me feel like I am a weirdo in the society because everyone is criticizing like it is a normal behavior. If you don't do it, your abnormal.

depression,Trying to keep my head above water I’ve been dealing with depression that got worse postpartum last year and with the pandemic and a pretty wild baby I’ve been struggling to keep it together. I’m fine 2 1/2 weeks out of the month but a good week and a half I want to die. It’s mainly my hormones affecting it so badly. Anyways I recently started confiding in my husband as a safe space but I’m starting to really feel like it’s not. It started during sex about a week ago he made a comment about how I’m not “whining and crying now” and at the time it didn’t bother me but last night I couldn’t stop crying over it. I want to talk to him about it but also feel like it may not go over well. Also he said that he recently talked about my issues but didn’t go into details about what and who and it’s driving me crazy. Half the time I clearly bury my head in the sand and it’s been so hard. My life is good but I can’t stop feeling like this. Antidepressants didn’t work well and the side effects were too much on me. Any advice/thoughts/help would be appreciated. I don’t feel like I’m full on going to end myself right now but I’m so tired of sinking so low and only resisting because my kids need their mom! I just don’t know what to do and every time I talk to anyone I don’t think they understand the depth of pain that I’m feeling inside. I always get stupid comments about how good I have it and it could be worse. I know this but it’s not something I can control and I absolutely hate how this is ravaging my life! I keep worrying my husband will get sick of me and find someone else if I stay broken like this and I hate that I can’t just talk to him and get the support that I so desperately need.
depression,"Life is not for me For a while now (at least 5 years) i’ve felt that I never truly belonged anywhere, never fit in. I’ve come to the conclusion that life isn’t for me. I’m too sensitive, too anxious, too caught up in everything to even lead a “normal” life (whatever that is.) Point is, I’m just not cut out for it. I’m certain of that. Even the smallest things overwhelm me; ordering food at a restaurant, walking my dog around the neighborhood, literally just having a conversation with someone. I stay up till 5/6/7 in the morning every night, putting off sleep because I dread the next day. I dread having to pull the covers off my body and enter reality. It’s all too much. I get attached to people easily as well, way too easy. Once someone is in my life, I never want them to leave, no matter how toxic they may be. I will always see the good in them. When they leave (they always do) god does it fucking crush my soul. It destroys me. It doesn’t get easier the next time, and there’s always a next time. There is always pain. I’m always getting hurt. I’m just so tired. I’m only 21 and I don’t even do anything with my life, but i’m fucking drained. Every day is the same exact routine. I’m either glued to my phone or laptop and I just waste time until it’s time to sleep. This is no way to live and I know that. I feel so stuck and I don’t think i’ll ever not feel this way. No matter how hard I try to change things, after a while I end up right in this exact spot. So yeah, i’ve accepted that life wasn’t meant for me. In the meantime, i’m just trying to get to the next day."
depression,"Having a hard time with life (rant) I know I’m a very intelligent and strong person but sometimes I feel like no matter what I do it’ll never be enough.

I need help. I’m so sad. I feel like nobody can help me but I know somebody can, I know I can overcome these feelings I have been feeling for so long. I don’t just want to be distracted from them I want to really heal these open wounds that are keeping me from really living"

depression,"I’m glad I work nights Security guard for a tech building. It’s *so* nice to work overnights, despite how so many people seem to think the hours are  terrible. I loathe humanity and any job where I don’t have to smile, be polite/friendly for 8+ hours a day or even communicate with anyone is great. It’s outside of normal business hours for the client, so it’s only once in a blue moon that I even see anyone pull onto the lot at all.

It's been about a month without them, and the depressive feeling and suicidal thoughts are getting heavy, but I don't want to depend on medication for the rest of my life (personal choice). 

Do you have any advice on how to best (naturally) alleviate the depression?

depression,"The package and the hole (This is not a confession, nor mine. I am simply curious what people might think about somebody who wrote this.)
I spent years of my life, my primary, my secondary; dreaming and conceptually asking for a lie. The few things that gave me happiness were nothing more than little packages that promised on their surface to give me that which I had not had for most of my life as a student. As soon as I opened these packages I realized all the disgusting things they had inside, it was not only the same indifference, ignorance and impurity that I had tried to disregard throughout my life, but also, it was the celebration and appreciation of all these things I had hated. The worst of the case is that I had asked for that miserable package and I do not know if it was out of fear or the lack of interest with which I had become used to living my days that I did not open the door to receive it until what it contained was irretrievably expired. I wonder if in the future it will be for me, as for so many people that once time passes and the contents of the package are fermented in a substance that causes them the same illusion of happiness that my dreams of the future caused me, that I will finally appreciate the false happiness brought by the pleasant lie that temporarily fills that very hole in which we will end up. The same hole that has been my home for a long time, where I have found some tranquility and calm, this hole has the name of loneliness. It is easier to hide in the darkness of this hole where my dreams and fantasies are perfect than to go outside where imperfections are so revered. Once in a while like a diver whose oxygen tank runs out, I would go outside to breathe, but when I did I was naturally so disappointed that I dug that hole more and more. I isolated myself to such an extent that those who originally saw me dig my hole with indifference, now whispered to each other and began to mock that lonely miserable digging his hole. It is incredible the fear that causes me to get out of that hole to meet the expectations of those who laugh, even though I don't like to think about it, I wonder: if I continue digging this hole will it be my grave?"

also, srry if my english is trash i'm not a native speaker, ty

so

i've been struggling a lot with feelings for quite a long time now, i think it has been almost 7 years since i'm at this weird numbness state and it's SO bad.

i can't properly talk with my friends, my hygiene is getting worse, my parents are dealing with really serious health issues, my health is obviously bad as well, i need to think of getting a job and figuring my life out and etc, a lot of stress basically
 but what makes it worse is the fact that even with ALL of this going on, i don't feel sad(?)

my mom literally almost died last year, and i didn't even know what i was supposed to feel, i still don't know actually

the only thing that i feel is anxiety, from times to times(almost every month) i wake up really angry with this emotional numbness, then i have a bad crisis for the entire day, i sleep, and it loops

you know those small details that makes you smile a little? maybe you saw a cute cat, maybe a funny video, just random stuff
even those things don't ""work"", every single time i smile, i feel like i'm just faking it


oh and i struggle a lot if my relationships, i usually ignore my friends for idk how many days, i have no energy to meet new people, but at the same time i don't want to be alone(this sounds so toxic, sorry :/)
this is one of the things that make me feel like complete shit, i feel like i am only SUPPOSED to be their friend instead of actually being it? i always try to be really kind with everyone, but do i actually MEAN it?
i don't even know how to describe this, it's just bad and it makes me sound like a toxic person(and honestly, i probably am, and i hate it)


it's almost like i don't exist, or like i'm just watching my life going on without having control over anything

so yeah i don't know if this will ever go away or if i even want it to go away(i've been like that for so long that idk anymore)

honestly i just wanted to talk about this"

depression,"I guess, I'm not suited for life. First of all, sorry for my English, I'm not a native. Anyway, I hope I will express myself intelligibly.

Frankly, I don't expect some solution. And I don't think that I'm alone in this trouble. So, I would like to know how you deal with feelings like this.

Where to start?

I'm human. (At least I'm trying.) And as a human, I'm not always good. I know how bad I am in some aspects, and this consciousness is too depressing. When I try don't think about that, I don't feel quite like myself. I want to remember it. It's too important for me. But I feel so bad then that I'm incapable do anything good to be a slightly better person. That's funny how paradoxical it is.

Honestly, I want to die due to this feeling, but I can't kill myself, because of my sister and mother. I can't kill myself when they're alive. I certainly don't want to hurt them. 

It will sound stupid, but I even wanted to start smoking because I would maybe die sooner. And because it's soothing (and I feel anxious all the time). But I can't even smoke because I don't want to support animal testing connected with cigarette production.

The only thing I like to do is writing, but everything I write I instantly hate and destroy.

All in all, I think I'm too weak to living. I deeply admire other people, but I'm also scared of them. I can't stand that cruelty that is so connected with mere existence. My comfort is redeemed by the suffering of others, less fortunate, and I hate living. And it's so unfair. I'm so ungrateful, but I can't help myself. I'm just unable to fulfill my idea of human, and it prevents me from trying at all."
depression,"Why do i get ridiculed almost ever time i try to seek help for myself? For example I've been trying to get therapy and besides the countess obstacles of actually getting it, when someone catches wind of it, you get put down ""there's nothing wrong with you"" and such. Im not trying to make anyone else pay for it or anything. Why does that I'm trying do something set people off? 

Another example is when i got my first prescription and cvs outed me calling the house via robot about a refill even though I never gave them a number. And Don't misunderstand, I don't consider this to be a toxic living situation, most things are normal but when it comes to this particular area is where thing tend to get dicey.

And reddit is no exception but internet is internet i suppose."
depression,"Feel so unlikable and isolated I have no friends - I cut out the toxic ones after a particularly bad argument with them all one night.

I'm always too anxious to speak to my college classmates because I always feel like such a waste of space and energy. I have university to look forward to in September - but I'm terrified that I'll find nobody there, both in terms of new friends and a partner.

I thought things were going well; I've been talking to a great girl recently and we've planned to meet in July and we get on really well. The other day she asked me if I could see us being a more permanent thing - naturally I said yes, as long as we vibe well enough in person and know each other a bit more. She felt the same, but said that she wants to see how things go with another guy across a fucking ocean in America before exploring me as an option. I'm literally a stopgap, second best. The first time things have seemed to be going well with no complications on the relationship front in my whole life and I'm seen only as an insurance policy.

What makes me so undesirable and unlikable? I wish I knew. I wish someone would tell me how to improve myself and fix myself. I hate feeling like I'm missing out on life but nobody wants to give me a chance"

I am new to this subreddit but I am searching for help. I am desperate actually.
I know that healing from depression might be quite a long process but can you guys give me some tips? Unfortunately I cannot afford therapy now and I do not have a lot of friends so basically I m pretty on my own.
I do not have energy of doing anything. After I have one or two productive days (doing chores, doing some workout, maybe study a little bit) I will have a week of staying in home, sleeping 10+hours etc. I am doing almost nothing during the day, cannot find energy even for daily tasks.
If I am not doing anything during the day, I get a little bit anxious during the night before falling asleep.
I had the ""i gotta start now"" and ""i will do it now""  thoughts but unfortunately I had no succes. 
I just feel something is wrong and broken in me and I do not know how to fix it. 
I just feel like I am at the rock bottom. 
I am pretty sure that I can not overcome it alone, but I just need some tips to start, when I ll be able to afford some therapy, definetely I will do it.

I am living alone, I dont have a job, the only hobbies I have are watching TV series, playing a mobile phone game untill I get bored of it and get high. These are not hobbies that I enjoy, just to waste the time.

Please give me some tips guys, how can I have that energy and that sense of responsability? How do you guys get disciplined?"

depression,"Tomorrow will be a month since I lost my mom and I feel dead inside. April 08, 04:24 AM - I received a call at midnight that my mother breathed her last. Upon hearing this I went numb and dead inside. I didn’t know how to react. How does one react to a news like this? 

I lost my father almost 23 years ago and my mother was my world. More often than not in my existence of 30 years on earth, I have struggled to meet eye to eye with my mother, and yet it feels like someone has ripped my heart out completely. She WAS my place of love, rage, anger, pain - she was my place to complain and that’s probably the most propelling beauty of a mother-daughter relationship - she was my place of everything. 

The insurmountable pain in my heart and the grief is too very real to overcome. I feel like I can’t breathe. She was suffering from third stage of cancer, COPD, and slowly her organ shut down. I get calls and messages from people everyday telling me to be strong. But all I want to do is shout at the top of my lungs and telling them that “I don’t want to be strong. I want to be vulnerable and I want to cry” but I cannot because I feel dead inside.

Why doesn’t society normalise grieving even when it says it does? Why does it see being vulnerable even at the worst moments as the sign of weakness? I cannot sleep at night, I cannot cry, and often it is so hard to breathe. My heart aches so much but those damn tears just won’t come. I feel like my life has no purpose and I am alone in this world and that feeling is so scary that I have panic attacks almost everyday. 

I am a 30-year old orphan battling a domestic violence case against my estranged husband and although I have friends and relatives, it is just not the same. It’s those little things that my mom did, even as simple as a phone call everyday to ask me if I have eaten that I terribly miss. 

My father committed suicide and I have been suicidal prone and attempted many times in the past. And with mom gone, I feel like my life has no meaning, no purpose and it is just so hard to carry on. And the worst part is, I don’t even know how to grieve. The sleeplessness, the depression, the anxiety is killing me slowly. 

I have been strong all my life, through my father’s death, through childhood sexual abuses, through getting raped, through a bad marriage and domestic violence, through a heart attack at just 29, and through battling COVID in a hospital - but I can no longer have the strength to carry on. 

I just have no hope left in me..."
depression,"Life keeps getting miserable, I am tired. Got diagnosed with cancer last year because of which I had to quit working. Few months down the line my savings started quickly evaporating and eventually turned into pennies.

Physically unable to work and desperate for a source of income I withdrew a line of credit made available to me via a credit app. I tried to put that money in stock market, to see if I can earn from trading. I wasn't a newbie in the market but only had experience investing and not trading.

Fast forward today, I'm miserable. There are not many job openings because of the pandemic and I am in debt. 

I don't know what I am gonna do. I wish I never got diagnosed with cancer. Life was pretty okay for me before that and everything started going downhill since. 

In the past few months I have often thought that it would have been better if I didn't make it out alive after the operation or from chemo. While on chemo most of the nights I felt like I may not wake up the next morning. I wish that would have turned true.

I feel like cancer has fucking destroyed my life. I always wonder how great life would have been if I hadn't gotten diagnosed. I'm in my early 20s for fucks sake. No one at this age neither expects or is ready for these things. Yet somehow I ended up in it.

I never thought, I would one day end up in debt. I was pretty great at managing my money. And for someone at my age I had a pretty decent savings as well. Cancer fucking took everything from me and it continues to do so.

Not only the above, but it has fucked me up emotionally. None of my friends understand what was it like for me. Everyone expects me to behave normally or as if it didn't happen. As if everything is okay now that I am cured.

But the truth is it did happened and it fucked me up real bad. I cannot turn a blind eye to it, I cannot live normally after going through the trauma and I don't even feel like living anymore at this point.

It has, eventually rendered me broke and miserable. Something I never imagined in my wildest of thoughts. 

Fuck my life."
depression,"I’m sorry I have two cats and two dogs they’re the absolute best I love them with my life they’re like my children they really help me keep going but it’s getting overwhelming still I rather suffer alone than to be sent off or die because I want to know they’ll be ok and not abandon because my family aren’t big fans of pets but I see them as my children so it hurts me to think they’ll be abandoned or mistreated still I don’t think I can keep going maybe they’ll be better without me all of them including my family I am only a financial and emotional burden after all haha I should’ve ended it sooner maybe I should stop putting it off and just leave already but I’m scared to do it not because I fear death but because I hate to ruin the mood for my family they seem to finally be getting along I don’t feel on edge that often anymore maybe it’s just me but I think they’re just starting to get along again I bought them all gifts I hope it’s enough to make up for this you know also it was Mother’s Day yesterday so maybe I should hold off a bit more haha you know would be kinda of shitty of me to do it now especially since my mom told me I was selfish for wanting to die I know it is but I feel like I do my best to bring the family together I try to make Christmas and birthdays special so maybe they’ll remember I wasn’t always a fucking asshole lmao but still I don’t deserve anything but the suffer I get it’s all deserved but still it’s a lot for me I’m a weak bastard I don’t deserve to even end my suffering but I’d rather not go on it’s really lonely I know I’m surrounded by people but still I don’t have anyone who’ll take me seriously with good reason tho I’m an attention whore I probably do just want attention but idk I really hate talking to people even my therapist I cut her off I didn’t wanna be a burden anymore I don’t wanna be a burden anymore to anyone especially not my mom she works so hard she deserves better I should’ve done better she tells me to live for myself but how can I when she doesn’t like who I truly am I only live for my siblings, her and my babies still my will to keep going for myself is practically gone I just wanna help her dream a house and stuff and then peace out for good maybe I’ll be a better person in my next life maybe I’ll do better I really hope so.."
depression,"how do people become happy? I just don't understand. Nothing really excites me or make me happy anymore and when something actually gets me excited, nobody cares. No ones ever really cared to the point that I expect them same kind of responses when I try share what I'm excited about which makes things worse.  I'm genuinely an outcast among groups, forgotten, ignored or just brushed aside in conversation. Like what am I doing wrong, thinking wrong, look funny or weird or give of a bad vibe.  
I'm just empty now, waiting for the day 

I just don't know how to word the disaster that is my life, am I really worth the effort or am I a waste of oxygen. I just want to be normal, but I just don't fit in.

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, I just typed what came to mind."
depression,"I have stopped most of my body hygiene because I just can't. I haven't showered in over a month or two, I don't even remember. I think that this year I have showered once or twice so far. I haven't washed my teeth correctly in well over a year or two. Up until a few months ago I had at least been brushing them slightly from time to time just for the surficial looks in the occasional smiling or when speaking, but now a tooth brush hasn't touched my teeth for a long time. Wearing a mask anyway, nobody gets to see them. I haven't shaved for quite a while too. It looks wild but I guess it's not that bad. I just can't bring myself to care enough. I've stopped caring. And I don't know why. Is that normal? Is it a self-defense mechanism?

I am aware that the teeth thing is not good at all for me, but I just... can't bring myself to it. I'm bringing my body down and I can't help it. I just see no point. Neither do I in cleaning or doing household. I'm currently with my parents due to pandemic-related reasons, but if I was living alone I'd probably end up... living in complete chaos and either starve or eat extremely unhealthy snacks, because I wouldn't be able to bring myself to cook. I've also already gained quite some weight recently.

I am ""studying"", which means that I still don't have any clue what to do with my life, but am registered at university in a subject that I absolutely hate and know I don't want to study, but still I'm registered and pretend, for now, until I find a way out of this. I want to study something I'm happy with but I don't know what that could be.

At the moment I am just either at work (part time) or at home, being on the computer all day and playing games or doing whatever I can just for trying to cope with all of this... existential crisis or whatever it is, I don't know what name would fit it. And inbetween, I'm sleeping. Work, sleep, eat, game, wanting this to end, thinking about a way out and finding none, sinking deeper and deeper and deeper... that's my life right now.
Speaking of sleep, my rythm is the opposite of consistent, it shifts all the time... Yesterday I woke up 10 minutes before having to go to work. The day before, I woke up hours earlier than that. I actually wanted to go to sleep at 4:00 but ended up gaming until 8 and then had been looking at my phone until 13:00 (all before sleep). I sometimes look at things on my phone for hours at a time, wasting time... memes or whatever it is... I don't know what I'm even looking for.

And then work again, always, everyday. At least I'm gettinf some money with that. Sleep - proper sleep - is the only time where there's a chance of finding some peace, an attempt of hitting that inner ""restart"" button, if you're lucky and have a good sleep. When your back problems don't prevent you from that. Back problems that you shouldn't have in your early to mid twenties...

I feel like a failure. Life feels terrible, I have no idea what to do in it as a career to live from, and the best I've got so far is my highschool diploma which is essentially nothing. A bad grade on top of that, for reasons very related to the ones you see here. I've lost many years with this ""studying"" and I can't afford to lose any more. And the pandemic makes it all worse. I should be in my student's flat, studying, living an at least okay life, starting to get independent and have an own little household, meeting new people and making new acquaintances and friends, maybe finding someone to date and have a relationship with..... instead, _this_ .....
can't see anyone, time goes by, no end in sight..... isolation and depression. That's it for now.

I'm lonely. Haven't seen my few friends that I have in quite a while. Regarding lovelife, I think you first have to have a life that is not such a mess in order to be able to date someone or lead a proper, healthy relationship or have a chance for it... Well I don't really know when that will be...
I actually was in a relationship up until recently. But it was an abusive one, sadly. I got cheated on and it was overall very toxic. It was also my first relationship. I miss her but I know that it's wrong and leads nowhere except to more suffering and pain, and I'm trying hard to get over it. I've had an experience and don't know when the next time and try will be. I'll just wait until then. And I hope that next time it will be better.

Everything, everyday, feels like falling apart..... I don't know why, or what it is. Life shouldn't be like this, should it? Why does life feel so..... empty and meaningless? I don't want it to be like that. I want it to be good, I want to be happy. I don't want anyone to feel like how I feel right now. Gosh, where's the way out?

I currently have an idea of a plan. I'm thinking about quitting my job and switching studies, and using the time until next semester to prepare and maybe learn some extra skills..... not having to work everyday surely would have the effect of me being less exhausted and less needy of cooldown, or so I think.... I don't know. I just hope that everything will somehow work out in the end.

I'm scared of the thought of being alone and sad for my whole life, really frightened. If that's life then life isn't worth living. It would be suffering, except for the little up's of it. Well, there would be family... but still suffering. Other than that it would consist of these everyday ""calmers"" that are supposed to distract us from merciless reality for a moment, and gice us some nice feeling... like Netflix for example. I love movies, and series too, but I hardly ever even get to watch something anymore..... I just don't find the power for it. I think that I'm kinda mire addicted to the interactivity stimulation of video games, and need it..... even if I'd rather watch a movie sometimes.

I didn't want to bother anyone with this and I apologize if I did. I just...needed to write this, I don't know why or how it came but it happened, I needed to get this off my soul and just write it down, some kind of venting I guess.....
I don't even know why it was right now.

Thank you for reading this sentence and thank you even much more if you've read parts of the text, or even all of it. Thank you for your time. I hope you feel well and are healthy and good!"
depression,"How to stop myself from killing myself Most people will make a plan to end their life and then enact it, the problem is, I’ve never made a plan, walls just acted

I don’t want to kill myself, but I’m scared I’ll get a suicidal urge and act on it anyway 

Is there anything I can do to discourage myself from doing it, I’m not looking for long term solutions here, just something I can do in the moment when I get those urges"
depression,"I will never know what it's like to never have been depressed This shit developed in middle school for me. Couldn't it have at least waited until I graduated so I could be educated and properly developed? I'm 23 now and I have like 6 college credits to my name. Nothing else. No job, no friends (they all ditched me freshman year), and no skills. What the hell am I even living for?"

depression,"Depressive Episodes , Anxiety, Paranoia&amp; So Much Time Lost, Unbreakable Cycle and My Mental Health Hangs by a thread. Hello, I’m 23 years Old Male, 4th Year Student. I’m here because I have depressive episodes , paranoia and social anxiety for years now and I just can’t break the cycle of wasting my life. 

No I’m not a suicidal, drunkard, smoker, drug, gaming or even a sex addict. What I’m trying to say is there are days where I literally stop doing anything for a day or a couple of days and do nothing except play games or read stories to escape reality(during  my worsts it lasted for a year or months but this hasn’t happened for the past 3 years). I should have graduated 3-4 years ago if not for my condition. I even  developed improper posture, extreme muscle imbalance and gait due to inactivity.

During my non-depressive episodes I’m extremely productive, I sing, play guitar, exercise, maybe study or clean the house(I haven’t really studied for years because this triggers my episodes due to stress, mostly attend class or pass all the requirement)

How does pandemic make this worse? I’m stuck in my house with my mother and sister. They STRESS ME OUT, they’re not aware of it and I don’t like them. They’re not abusive or bad, polar opposite of everything I guess? Including personality? I also can’t sing because I don’t want to spread saliva unintentionally (literally unstoppable for anyone singing). They always want to keep everything open cause it’s hot when I want to close doors when singing.

My Anxiety and paranoia involves thinking that everyone is looking at or talking about me, and knows something bad or like a scandal about me(Sometimes I even search). I know there is none though it’s only in my head but I can’t stop thinking about it, specially in public. The extremely weird thoughts I thankfully got rid already it 
rarely triggers now.

I was able to do a lot before this pandemic and episodes are becoming more frequent,  now it’s happens either weekly, or half a month where I won’t do anything for a few days.

This is only some of the issues there is much, much, much, much more. 

I know what I have to do, and I can do it. Only problem is I’m stuck. What do you think I should do? Truth be told? I don’t want your advice, I guess I just want to share. I hope everyone is better in their lives right n"
depression,"hate my fucjing mom. it’s currently 4:03am. this is the 3rd time i’ve cried today because of my mom. i have been trying to sleep since 3 but i can’t stop crying. almost every morning or sometime in the day my mom yells at me. it’ll be 9am and i’ll still be sleeping and she’ll open my door and yell extremely loud. once she wanted me to clean the chicken  Coop and i told her i needed to shower. later when i was in the shower she started to bang and yell and even try to get into the bathroom. im terrified of her. i hate when she yells at me and whenever someone even just walks outside of my bedroom door i freak out. same with taking a shower. i cant without basically having a panic attack thinking i’m going to get yelled at, walked in on or dragged out. she always tells me how she’s “not the bad guy” and she’s just trying to “wake me up” because i need to understand how the “real world” will be . “you’re just selfish and miserable” “maybe if you would thinking of anyone else besides yourself and your phone” “i think you like being miserable” i can’t do it. i just want to live with my dad but i can’t bc my mom has 
custody over me. she is trying to take me, my brother, her soon to be husband, and his kids to nevada. i already want to fucking kill myself and if i have to go to nevada i will 100% do it. i just want her  to take me seriously, so maybe if she finds me dead she finally will. my mom won’t let me  stay with my dad. now that i have written this all down my problems don’t seem like problems at all. i just hear her voice in my head yelling at me to “get up, do school, clean my room, and do what you need to do.” then slamming the door as hard as she could. 

sorry about how bad the grammar is. i’m really tired and want to die and sleep. hopefully someone can give me advice. thanks."
depression,"Why do I still feel this way? I eat healthy, exercise regularly, sleep enough, try and do useful and or things I (used to) love, yet there's nothing...my spark is gone. Every day just feels like I'm slowly dying, which technically is true. How do people do this? How do they beat the existential dread of merely living? I'm in my twenties and I already feel like throwing in the towel. How am I supposed to get through this for minimum fourty more years? I don't see it, I don't see myself living past 30.

I have an objectively sad life: I live at home, never had a relationship, never had a proper job... I'm taking baby steps to rectify the last thing, but I don't even know if it's what I want. Life just feels boring and repetitive. Atop of that, I have so much left to attain that it overwhelms me, so I don't act on anything useful."
depression,"I want to so bad Last night I cut both of my wrists up quite alot (none deep just enough to cause a considerable amount of bleeding, I tried to show my mum my cuts on my wrists from the night before but I dont know if she didn't notice or if she just doesn't care. Usually I dont cut deep but this morning I cut deep for the first time on my leg and I got the urge to cut as deep and long as I could across my wrist just to see what would happen. The urge hasn't gone away this whole day and I'm actually considering it, I dont want to die but I just want something really bad to happen to me, I want to disappear and for everyone to forget that I ever existed"

Who cares if I’m nice? I have done nothing meaningful an in about to fuck up my entire graduation I’ve been working on forever. Why? Why did I have care enough about myself. I must be crazy and everyone already judges me. I feel like I’m about to lose everything and I can’t breathe. I usually can’t even bring myself from post but this is really all I feel I can do.

Sure you are kind and loving towards me,

But What's it to you if I end life accordingly.

Oh mother is 150k allowance maybe a myth,

For to this day I have not seen a penny from that sith.

Oh mother tell how do you think I feel?

When you compare me to him like, saying I'm of his kin,

Why is it I'm like him when you want me to do your bidding and kneel?

But What's it to you as you Complain to me about the hurt he did to you as if it's a new sin.

Oh mother how can I trust when you say seek refuge in the lord and he will heal.

But when he himself said don't be an idiot or you have in a sense signed your own seal.

depression,"Do you guys think medication is helpful? I continually struggle with making the decision to go on anti-depressants. On one hand, I feel like numbs you to the world and essentially puts a bandaid on a bruise that never heals. On the other hand, you can never truly be yourself. You’ll always be a watered down version of yourself who can’t express themself freely. I’m not sure whats better."
depression,"I feel like a burden I can tell I stress my partner out when I am having a rough time. When he tries to make me laugh, I feel guilty because I can’t even fake a laugh or try to cheer up because my brain is being mean to me. I get insecure over stupid things and I feel the constant reassurance I crave from him is annoying. I feel the love I so desperately crave, is not realistic for anyone to give me. I get anxious and I feel like it bothers him. I don’t know if it’s really just that he doesn’t know how to deal with it, how to help me through it. And I guess it’s not his responsibility to help me through it anyways. It just makes me feel isolated in my head, too much for anyone to put up with. Not lovable. The little things that I notice when I’m down makes it so much worse and I just feel crazy. No kiss goodbye before work, tries to make me laugh even though I’ve explained that makes it harder on me and that he can just ask what I need in the moment, shit like that. The guilt I feel for being like this is overwhelming. I just want to be held and told that I’m worthy and everything is okay. That I’m not everything I think I am."
depression,"I'm wondering if it's healthier to be depressed right now I've been working really hard on recovering and I'm burning myself out. Yes, meds and exercise and socializing all make me feel better, but my life in general is a bummer. I'm unemployed and living with my toxic family and I really can't do much about it until jobs stop rejecting me.

I'm trying so hard to be 0% depressed because I'm terrified of how bad I felt at my lowest point. But fighting so hard against feeling down when I have a lot of reason to be unhappy is probably making me feel worse? Maybe I should let myself wallow for a few days. My life is shitty and I want to feel like shit for while and just hope my meds keep me afloat well enough until I'm ready to get back into it."
depression,"The strong feeling of give up Hey folks.

I think I’ve been struggling with this feeling for a while and even though I do therapy and have my wife and my newborn by my side, I’m feeling weak.
Most of the days are me fighting to put a smile in my face, to seem normal but is getting harder.
I don’t feel like talk to my therapist or my family, I think I don’t have anything else to fight for, even now with my own wife and son.

The anonymous side of this made easier to write and put it out."
depression,"Man screw this life stuff Everytime I've tried to do or achieve anything I've always been put down by friends or family for not being good enough.Having to deal with my past and family issues on top having to perform better for people I don't care about that much.

depression,"Idk what to do Every night I fall  asleep with wet pillows from tears steering at a bottle of Xanax trying not to take all 60 pills to end the pain. I have nothing to be depressed by social norms. I’m a master tech for Porsche, live on the beach in Miami drive a $90k car. 6’4 tall bench press 495lbs curl 225lbs squat 585 (no steroids). I was brutally abused (you name it was done. rape torcher even had lighter fluid thrown on me and the only thing that save me from being burned alive was jumping in a alligator infested pond)growing up in a community because Im mixed with light skin and straight hair from 7 to 18 my name was “dirty Cracka” until I could have move as far away as I could. That’s why I built my body and have a large arsenal to make sure that can never happen again. I’ve been divorced twice with 4 kids and only 34 years old. No therapy works no medication work. I feel like a walker in walking dead just going through the motions of life. I just started to race motorcycles and I ride with no regards for my life. At least when it happens my family won’t have to live with the shame of me offing my self it would be reported as a accident. I can find a end for the pain and hate I feel."
depression,Why do I need to keep waking up I fucking hate it. I fucking hate life. I’m perfectly happy being asleep and I’m sure I’d be even happier dead.
depression,"The things I tell myself... Usually when I fall asleep, I'll lay there and just run through different communication scenarios in my head with different people and play out what could happen.

Last night it was different. One of these days I may not wake up. I told myself if I don't wake up, I hope my kids know I love them so much. I hope they loved me too. I wish I could have been better. And I hope they wouldn't be the ones to find me. I hope they could find another figure to love and depend on better than they could depend on me.

I'm really feeling it. Really just done with life. I'm not sure where I'm going next but man I am just fucking tired of living."

depression,"did i get over my depression or is this just a phase? hi! i was diagnosed with depression when i was around 15, and i am turning 18 in a few weeks. i stopped taking my antidepressants (lexepro + lamictal, olanzapine) around march of 2020, when lockdown started, and ever since then i haven’t really fell into much of a deep regression, in fact i think i feel better than ever. i also haven’t seen my therapist since then, but i don’t feel the need for one anymore. since it’s been over a year and i’ve been mentally healthy for most of it, i was wondering what exactly this means for my depression. 

TL;DR: no longer sad, still depressed?"
depression,"My suicidal ideation is hitting me again... I am just thinking about how alone I am and how no one is excited to see or be around me. I feel awful, and unwanted. I am working hard to improve myself, but man I have made so many mistakes and reflecting on them is tearing me up inside."
depression,"Im more than done That's exactly how i feel... I don't even have the energy to ask help.I am not motivated to do anything around the house for the last 3 years...My house is a mess, i have gain 50 pounds and look like a fucking mess myself.I shower once a week( yuk i know) I don't have any friends , i never really had some neither.I was the annoying girl , who feel so bad about herself and tried to attract attention..Im 31 no job,no friends and no family cause i pushed everyone to litterally hate me.
I have an incredible husband and a 12yo daughter, they are the reason why i keep waking up to be the vegetable that i am. I feel like everything is wrong with me , like even if I tried real hard to feel better it won't work cause im a fucking stupid bitch.I hate myself.

depression,"Yesterday Sucked (venting) (TW) So yesterday sucked I wasn't allowed on tech. which wouldn't be a huge deal if it didn't distract me from doing thing I shouldn't do(SH) and guess what I did do those things.

To put the cherry on top when I woke up my parents said ""See you sleep well bc we took away ur tech. say thank you"" and ofc I said ty bc I didn't want to say yes thank you for taking away my distraction from life and what prevents me from having breakdowns, anxiety attack, ect. :)  


tl;dr yesterday sucked"
depression,"My mom is exaggerating. My mom found out that I want to kill myself soon and she shouted at me and started crying. I don‘t get why she reacts like this, it never was a surprise after all.

It’s not her life, it’s mine, I am the one who‘s dying and leaving the world not her. So what‘s the matter?"
depression,"Back into this shit again Right when I thought I beat this, when I started feeling confident about myself, and had dreams, goals and motivation... Somehow I fell again, diagnosed with depression and on medication. 

I don't even know what's going on anymore, there is no reason for me to be depressed, I don't understand why my head is going against me, but it's happening and I feel miserable, useless and hopeless about this will ever reach an end unless I do it for myself, cut the little that is left of me and stop this suffering.

I don't know what hurts the most, holding on or letting go. Everytime I fall into this, the already little hope I have to eventually beat this fades a bit more, and it's almost completely gone. I don't have the force to cry, it's just emptiness inside me, but it feels so heavy...

depression,"Struggling I was never born in the place a lot of people were. A bustling nice rich place like London, Toronto or California. But a lot of my friends are from there. My mother calls me 'different and strange for not being like the others'

I feel like I don't fit in. I have a special interest that nobody else does (a DJ) and it's weird because everyone is so social but I just struggle with talking. I ignore people when I'm mad I could disappear in my bedroom for hours on end. 

I'm only 16 but my parents are 70. I feel like there's no hope for my future. I make people sad with my messages, so they go to sleep to ignore me. 

I'm trying to get into college. I haven't been to school for about 3 years due to mental health. I'm very poor (I'm running out of clothes) but my parents don't really care."

Anyway, i was lurking here and there on Reddit (mostly nsfw stuff to cheer myself up) from time to time, so creating account was just matter of time.

I have a depression for more than 6 years (i'm in my mid 20's), sometimes it gets really tough, sometimes it's bereable. I was fighting it myself, with my family, with psychologist and medicaments. Meds really helped a lot (i even began getting second degree, i'd never thought that i'd have energy for this). But meds aren't the solution, luckily, i managed to stop taking them, but depression still keeps coming back.

Psychologist said that i need hobbies, friends and gf. Well, hobbies should be fine, because my baking and cooking skills allow me to make hand-made presents like cakes and sweets and i get requests from my family the year ahead; also i like videogaming, i have small collection of 1.5k games on different platforms; and i don't mention traditional simple hobbies like listening music, reading books etc. Problem with friends and gf. I have none. Never had gf.

**Question(in case you don't want to read my wall of text): Do you really need gf/bf and how it can help or how it affects your life?** I remember when my psychologist was giving me different tests (dumb tests to be honest, not a big fan of psychologists and their books, real life =/= book), one of her first questions was about my gf. Maybe psychologist saw/found something important that i didn't.

Sorry for typos (English isn't my first language). Don't mind my nickname, tried to make it silly to cheer myself."
depression,"Broken again and just alone I had a friend that I made way back. We got on like a house on fire. Like more so than I’ve clicked with someone in quite some time. We messaged constantly and quickly fell for one another. She knew everything about me and I could actually open up and talk to her about real stuff and she’s the ONLY person that knows anything of what’s going on with me. We fell for each other and I for once had something that resembled some kind of happiness. We said we had each other’s back until the death and I truly felt that. I’d go through anything with her.

Now she’s messaged me saying she can’t do this and she needs someone there and now (it’s long distance cos Covid). I feel so heartbroken, like it actually makes me feel sick not having her around, it’s a connection I’ve not felt in SO long and the thought of not having her here makes me want to sleep forever. I just miss her so much we had everything in common. I’m devastated."
depression,"Do not feel like i have much in common with others I am beginning to become a old grumpy fucker, I do not exactly love to be around people but i keep on living this lie i have lived all my life. Keeping up the facade and pretend i am just as happy as the rest of the people in my life. Always been independent and hate to rely on others. But my back have gone to hell and i am not as strong as i used to be, and that is hard to accept i work my self into the ground and pays the price a week after.  I am to young to be in this kind of state, my mind is still 21 and i do not think it will ever grow up. 

I have always been kind of a deviant soul and used that to forget about my depression, trying my hardest to think on ANYTHING else but the endless sadness that i feel when my mind is left to its own devises. 

I spent yesterday outside doing way to much and to day i am stuck inside, the brain starts to wander into darkness again and i can not fight back.

I have a lot of hobbies but i can not keep myself interested. It is fun for a week or 2 and then i loose interest and goes back to square 1. 

Been reading a bunch of virtual novels and listen to countless audio books, it helps then and there but the feeling of not belonging anywhere returns after a while.  I am nothing like the people i live amongst, i feel like a outsider everywhere i go. I live in a society i don\`t want any part of and i am forced to live like this by standards others have made for me long before i was born.  

I am living a lie and every time i wake up i play my part and just keeping up the appearance of a normal man just doing normal things.

I was born in the wrong place and the wrong time wrong species and wrong planet.

Things i have done in the past keeps on haunting me and will not let go even tho i was a child when it happened, i just want to dig my self a hole and end it. 

It will get easier i tell myself but when? In the meantime i am doing my best to smoke myself to death.

Thank god it is Friday and i have a bottle of whiskey on standby. 

And if you made it this far in my rant/vent i thank you for your time. Just needed to get some of it off my chest."
depression,"school is destroying my life All the pressure, all those expectations. I can't take it anymore. I'm drowning in assignments and I'm supposed to revise and sit 15 assessments before I graduate, yet I can't even find the strength to wash my face or take a shower. 

I feel so bad--so guilty.

I'll never get the grades I need for university.  Hell, I don't even want to go to university. I don't want to do anything with my life, but at the same time I can't stand how everyone will go ahead--how all of my schoolmates will finish their studies and 'accomplish great things', while I'm here doing nothing. It feels like everyone is going ahead and I'm walking backwards. I don't want to be that person who people will label as a 'failure', but that's who I am, and everyone will soon be aware of it.

I'm consciously destroying my life, and I can't help it. 

I wish I could just disappear or go to bed and never wake up again. 

I want to be erased."
depression,Motivating myself to be better I'm just tired of being selfish; bored; and sick. I'm gonna finish college and get a job.
depression,"30 and never lived a day in my life I guess i have always been depressed but never really thought much of it. I'm now 30 and I'm all of a sudden cognizant of all my failures. 

Looking back I have never really lived a day in my life. Never had any friends due to severe social anxiety, probably on the autism spectrum, never formally diagnosed. Never been in any relationships, hell, haven't had any sort of intimate contact with the opposite sex. Never travelled, never had any sort of a social life; spent all of my time holed up in my room and never made any efforts to improve myself. Skipped school a lot in my teens and had to be held back an extra year but by some miracle was able to go onto university which i somehow graduated from. Fat good that did me other than getting me into massive debt since i barely make above minimum wage at my job which took me over a year to land. I can't even drive at this age and still live with my elderly parents who i depend on for everything. I haven't left my room for over a year now since my job is fully WFH due to COVID. Don't have any reason to leave the house anyways since i have no one. I see no purpose in life other than repaying my parents for everything they did for me but I screwed up even that. I was retarded enough to stake their retirement savings and lose more than half of it last year. 

I want to try to get better but I just don't have the energy or motivation to even try. What is even the point when at 30 I have 0 life experiences."
depression,"If life isn’t real, then why do I punish myself so much? How can I know if life is actually worth living? I don’t go to bed looking forward to the next day, and quite honestly, I often find myself hoping to not wake up. 

If life really isn’t real, then why do I imagine such a terrible existence for myself? Like, I don’t particularly enjoy spending months at a time in a smallish psy hospital with my only connection to outside being blinded windows. 

I try to imagine a better future, but each day grows darker and darker. As much as I fantasize about death, I wonder anymore if death is a thing or a creation of my own subconscious."
depression,"What good is being able to identify all the things you're doing wrong when you don't do anything about them? I always hear ""admitting you need help is the first step"" or ""you seem pretty emotionally intelligent"" or ""it's good that you're able to understand what you need to improve on"". I still don't change anything. I stagnate. It doesn't bring me comfort to know that I could be working towards benefitting myself, and I know what I should try to do or what I should try to work on. I just sit around doing nothing constantly.

It's just laziness. I hate it. There is no silver lining. No ""blame it on the depression"". I am doing nothing about my situation and I have absolutely no excuses. Me recognizing this is just another layer."
depression,"How do you all cope with being alone? Just wondering how you all cope with being alone, I need to stop having breakdowns and just accept I am alone so any help is appreciated."
depression,Struggling My body dysmorphia has made me feel extremely unworthy of the kindness people show me. I want to starve and hurt myself... but I won’t. I just wanna be better. Look better. Like what I see in the mirror for once in my life! I want to be able to accept a compliment and not be so sure it’s to save my feelings. I hate the way I look more than I value my desire to love myself.
depression,"Depression shouldn’t be taken lightly Depression is real and much other illness, not saying no one isn’t having issues but wish most from what I’ve read stepped back and realizes that it’s not as bad as it may seem"
depression,"insecurities im 6'0 119 pounds 
i've recently been losing weight and it's getting so bad 
im constantly body shamed 
it's so frustrating everyone i talk to "" has it worse "" and it makes my feelings invalid 
it's always taken as a joke and my family even makes fun of me 
i love everything and everyone even though im an asshole sometimes, but please i need help nothing is helping anymore and im nearing the edge of all this unnecessary shit"
depression,"Me Again Its been almost 3 weeks since I haven't abused these pill and syrup but I don't think I can keep this up. I miss that feeling of leaving this ""place"" even if it is only for a night, I don't know how to explain that feeling of being on these pills and syrup. It is like your whole body is just numb from all the pain physically and mentally. That you can finally relax and just rest. These have been the loneliest 2 and a half weeks of my life. All the shit I did for my friends and seeing them not give a damn about me hurts you know. If the situation was flipped and god forbid one of my friends was in the accident I was, I would be checking up on them daily, asking them if they need anything, need to go run errands, spend time with them you know. But it is what it is, 75% of my wishes I would of died that night, it would have made things a hole lot easier, then the other 25% keeps asking myself, why am I here? Why does god keep saving me from me ending my life, I know for a fact that average person would have OD on these pills and syrup a long time ago but it seems no matter how much I take nothing happens. I pray no one out there ever feels this pain I have inside, that no one ever feels this loneliness, I am just tired and really don't know how much more I can do this. I doubt anyone ever reads these post, but as usual if no one has told you this... I love you, you are doing enough, you are special and you MATTER ❤️"
depression,"Is it weird that one of the main reasons I hate being away for university is because I miss my dogs so much. I have two dogs, one is 7 and the other is 4 and I miss them so much. They help me out with my depression alot whenever theyre around and I just love them. I get sad everytime I think about how much of their lives I am missing. I tried to see if other people were having similar experiences and I found a few posts of people asking how to stop missing their dogs so much. Everyone in the comments essentially said to “just get over it and grow up” also “its not that big of a deal”. It just makes me really sad and angry that people are so insensitive because as ridiculous as it might sound I love my dogs just as much as my family and friends."
depression,"Should I see a counselor or something? I don't really want to spill my life story but for the last few years I've considered finding a counselor or someone to just vent to. My dilemma is that I'm not super f*cked up, I've had a fairly easy life. Its just that for the last couple years it's been looking forward to leaving the military, it was always ""once I'm done with this sh*t life will be better"". Then I got out and thats how it was, but after 3 weeks I was anxious and decided ""it will be better when I get a job"". Now I have a job(thats pretty decent) but nothing has changed. I'm sorry if this is irrelevant but I just don't know what to do"
depression,"I want to kill myself I did all the shit I'm supposed to. Told my family, got help, got put on meds. I started recovering I was still upset, but it was kinda bittersweet. Now like the world wanted to tell me to give up my dog got cancer, my cat ran away, and my social anxiety got to the point where I'm scared to reply to comments on my anonymous account. I've always told myself that suicide is so stupid, but at this point I really want to. The only thing stopping me at this point is the fear of nothingness. I haven't told my family, but I never tell them anything besides when I'm forced to like when I was depressed. They never found out to what extent it was too. It's not like they were there for the stuff they knew about anyway. When I was raped they literally nothing. I was taught that its bad to not be ok so now when they ask its always, "" I'm doing fine"". I still have to talk to my uncle who is a child molester and a domestic abuser. ( he didn't molest me he did it to my sister). I can't say anything because my family kept it a secret. My parents knew that I had ADHD and waited until I was 15 to tell me. I always thought there was just something wrong with me. Something happened to my legs and it hurt so bad and I was told to push through it. Now I told my dad that I'm feeling worse than when I started my meds and he said that I'm probably just going to have to push through it. I'm so sick and tired of ""pushing through it"". I'm reading this back and Holy shit my life has spiraled out of control. I'm only 15 so this probably seems like I'm  overreacting and I probably am, but that doesn't change how I feel. I wish I wasn't so much of a pussy and did at least something about how I feel."
depression,"just thoughts When a dear friend died about five years ago, something inside me broke, almost like a guitar string snapping.  The song has gone out of things.  Even when I am with people I love, doing something I enjoy, helping somebody, learning something - behind all that, I'm empty.  I've had issues in the past and in former years they came back to haunt me in waves, but the feelings of sadness always receded and I still experienced periods where life was very meaningful, I felt connected to my loved ones, and the future felt like a place I could make my own, even if only in some small way.  I don't feel that way any more, not really.  I still love my friends and family and feel extremely grateful to have them, so my life is still full of love, and I want for nothing - but each day feels smaller, and I float further away from everything.  Any therapy I've tried is just awkward, I have nothing to offer and feel bored hearing myself talk about thoughts that mean nothing to me as soon as they leave my mouth.  I don't want to die, but each day I live forces me closer to a future I dread.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this - it's difficult to keep these thoughts in my head, even though I'd never want to share them with anybody I know."
depression,"Turning gay I need your help desperately So this whole thing started in January 2021 and I’ve been freaking out till this day and I don’t know what to do, I know that deep inside me that I am straight and forever be straight but I can’t get back to the normal person who I was before and I keep thinking about gay stuff, I know this isn’t my future and I’ll never change my sexuality, I did some research on myself my testing to watch gay porn to see if I have an reaction but I don’t, but when it comes to normal porn like female and male I seem to enjoy them but like same thoughts are coming back ‘are you gay’ and I keep saying ‘no’ but that still doesn’t change. I’ve been crying for months and months and it’s freaking out, I have this one rule that if I was to turn gay then I would happily kill myself cause I don’t like being in a relationship with a guy and I want to be in a relationship with a girl. My thoughts are also ruined, like I don’t find them attractive but tend to think about them having sexual activity and it hurts my brain, I’ve been crying through my face mask with my hood up, I don’t want to be gay and I want to go back to the person that I was before January by liking women’s and their body. It got scary to the point where I wanted to kill myself and I’ve never experienced this kind of stuff in my life, like I said I know that deep inside me that I am 100% straight and 0% gay and I’m not homophobic, I just don’t like the concept of me being in a relationship with a guy or never enjoyed being in a relationship with a guy. So please give me useful information to keep thinking of a good path for me to go through and when I mean good path I meant going back to liking woman cause I’ve been trying to get that energy that I have before January but I can’t get it back."
depression,"I don't want to exist I see no point in it. I really gave college a try again. Im not doing well in two of my classes. I lack the ability to communicate to anyone in my classes. The people in my physics class know I'm incompetent and won't help me. My teachers can't help me because I don't know how to ask the right questions or don't understand the topic enough.i understand the teachers can only help me if I have specific questions but the only thing I can say is that I don't understand how to do something. I keep failing my calc quizzes. I'm pretty sure I'm mentally deficient but no one has told me yet. I remember when I was in elementary school I was with some other ""special"" kids but in that group I would be ahead in terms of understanding. I'm pretty sure everyone else in my age group got the play book on how to socialize. Albeit I always preferred being alone so maybe I screwed myself by isolating. I hate the competitive attitude that Is forced into everyone's heads in college. I don't care about being better. I'm looked down on by everyone and I know they're laughing behind my back I heard them.My last ""friend"" from high school called me a loser to my face even though he though was being indirect about it. I hate that your selfworth is based on hardwork.Today is my birthday and I don't want to exist."
depression,"I can't cry myself to sleep anymore I've noticed lately that I keep trying to cry myself to sleep at night. 

But I can't.

I feel like I'm at a point where, I'd rather feel utter and raw, sadness, than to feel nothing at all... 

All I feel is nothing, there's nothing but emptiness inside my soul."
depression,"Night Terrors Lately, I have been under stress. To point where I actually frantically itching myself in sleep (elbow, arm, stomach, legs, feet, and hands.) I felt like I had a bug bite all over, I’m very upset when I woke up and feel burning of itch desire. I had to put lotion on myself to sooth it and calm the desire to itch bad. Not only that, I would have wake up crying because I dreamed one of my siblings self-suicide in my dream, it felt so real. Like I had to call one of them to make sure that they’re breathing. 

My nightmare compare to night terrors are no big deal, it’s like mostly from scary movie or my biggest fears. But night terrors, it felt so real. Like I couldn’t get out of it, sometime I feel like someone are shocking me for trying to wake up from night terror. I always want to know what is that, why am I getting hurt for try to wake up. 

What’s your advices to slow down the night terrors."
depression,"All day in bed So right now Im writting in my bed, I just want to stay in bed all day, I get anxiety everytime I have to go out my psych told me that I need to go for a walk but just thinking going out get my stress level high, I'm taking pills for depression and lorazepam for anxiety but it doesnt help to much, I have to add that 2 and a half years ago I had a breast cancer with 42 years old, chemo, cirurgy ( mastectomy and lymph nodes)and radiotherapy now Im ok and I had more energy that time than now Im taking hormone pills for 5 years and my menstruation gone because of chemo, I feel so lost and things before I used to enjoy now its gone and like I said just want to stay in bed is like my sanctuary. Im just so helpless and lost."
depression,"How do you stop being jaded? I'm not asking how to avoid it, because I'm already jaded. Unfortunately. I'm 24 and I've had two depressive episodes since 2019 and as of 2021, I'm still getting treated with antidepressants. After everything I've been through, nothing excites me anymore. There's just nothing to look forward to in life, there's nothing I even want. I don't know how to start LIVING again. I feel like I'm just waiting to die"
depression,"How sustainable is a diet of pure anger? My only motivation is to show people I'm not useless and I'm not a liability. I'm not happy with myself until others admire me. Fuck off with the love yourself advice, it doesn't work. At least not for me."
depression,"How do you stop suicidal thoughts? I have them so intense, all the time. It's getting really bad. Sometimes I have moments of clarity and fight and I'll get up and fight the thoughts, but that has happened so much in the past and I've just gone back to how I'm feeling now. I just felt the need to get up now and be strong but I've remembered each time I've done that and nothing changes in the end. It's exhausting. I've lost a lot of people in my life because of my bpd, it's hard remaining in relationships. I also had a psychotic episode in summer which led me to be sectioned and changed me for the worst. I've been in a depressive episode since. I try and stay positive. But it gets so hard to always constantly have my thoughts in one direction. I try to hold on to things to keep me alive, like my nieces, one's 5 and the other is 6 months old. She's so beautiful. I've just set her as my phone background to keep me fighting. I want to see them grow up. I remember 5 years ago before my first niece was born, I fought to stay alive again to meet her. And 5 years later I'm still in the same position. I really just don't want to be here. I want to be in the cosmos. I want my physical form to decompose and turn into flowers and give itself back to the Earth again. I'm not afraid of death, I just think maybe I should atleast give this life a go. And when I do die, of it being old age, my guides will meet me in the afterlife and congratulate me on making it through. Because I know I need to complete this journey, I'm just not sure why it's so hard.

Can anyone tell me what they fight for?"
depression,"I'm slowly going down a spiral of despair and it's ruining my relationship I've had depression for about 4 years, it comes in waves but means my mood can change throughout the day. My partner has been supportive previously but I'm now driving him away with how upset I get from the smallest of arguments. Every small argument makes me lose my shit, crying and all I can think about is hurting myself (I've never self harmed before). I just despair that we can't go a day without this happening and it's sad seeing my actions ruin the best thing I have but I feel so out of control. This is going to ruin my relationship and kill me if I go on like this"
depression,"I really hate my inner voice My inner voice fucking sucks. I haven’t been the happiest recently and sometimes I try to think happy thoughts to try to make me feel better. 9 times out of 10 they fail, because my inner voice immediately goes “kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, die die die, you fucking idiot, you fucking idiot, you fucking idiot” over and over and over and over and over and over again. It’s become such a bad habit now it feels as if it’s automatic. Sometimes it feels like I’m fucking fighting my inner voice with my inner voice (if that makes sense? Like I’m trying to be positive but I’m still just repeating die die die and stuff). I used to think there was no way in hell I was depressed but boy is that opinion changing fast."
depression,"Night sweats I've been regularly getting night sweats, it's pretty disgusting waking up to everything being soaked.
Plus I can't be cleaning sheets and quilts everytime... 
Sometimes I'll sleep through the whole night and wake up, others bad dream might wake me up in the middle of the night (can confirm turning quilt over, pillows over and trying cover the mattress with something dry so I can go sleep is not a fun process when it's cold).

I haven't been to a doctors, with lockdown and all here. Obviously my mental health is bad, anxiety is all over the place and I'm depressed. 

Has anyone had these troubles and found ways of reducing these sweats? (I sleep naked 95% of the time if that makes any difference). Or seen a GP about the issue

Many thanks."
depression,"I don't think that I can do this much longer I am so broken. I have been broken my entire life. 

I was abandoned by my mother when I was 14 and I haven't seen her in almost 16 years. I haven't seen my perverse father in so long that I don't bother trying to remember. That man tortured me for years and I'm glad he isn't in my life. 

Worse than all of the that, I am married to sex/porn addict. The man I love, he doesn't love me back and it was made clear tonight. 

At 3 AM the phone calls and hangups started. I have 7 missed/hung up FaceTime calls from my husband. I call him back and he finally answers. I see the inside of a room. I die inside. I know what that means because he is supposed to be in a building full of computers, working the grave yard shift, not in someone's room. 

I sent at least 20 texts, because I am that crazy person now. 

My husband was cheating on me with a man from Craigslist (what kind of married man gives blowjobs to another man in a car over and over again if he doesn't like it??) and has been ""sober"" for 64 days. That was all a lie, apparently. 

I have no degree, no job, and no money. I was in school but had to leave and I don't even think I can go back because how do you focus with a husband like mine? 

I have been married to a man for 10 years that never should have gotten married in the first place. 

I have no where to go. I am stuck. Normally I would be in tears, trying to catch my breath when this happens. I cried for a minute or so and then I felt nothing. Life is not worth all this. What is the fucking point? 

I want to start life over."
depression,"Friends are slowly drifting away This is my first time ever using Reddit literally made the account not too long ago but I need to get something off my chest. 

Before I start sorry about my grammar I kinda suck at it so bear with me. 

I’ve noticed over the past few years that my friends have gradually been drifting away from me and stopped speaking or hanging out with me. 

First of all so you guys can get to understand me I used to be the type of kid who would never be at home and always be hanging out with friends or doing something outside. I was a very social kid, still shy but I liked spending my time around others and making new friends. Over the last couple of years I have realized that I’ve lost basically all but two of my friends and I’m slowly losing them too. I’ve been having social issues for the past two years transferred schools and am now taking online school. My friends are very social people and always ask me why I transferred and why I am taking online school. They are currently taking online school right now because of A recent COVID situation and have told me how they can’t understand how I like it over regular school. This really pisses me off considering I clearly don’t want to talk about it since I never give them an explanation and have even told them that I just want to forget about it. My friends don’t seem to understand. The only thing that has been helping me so far is lots of video games they help me forget about everything and seem to be the only thing keeping me happy at this point.

Now that I’m done with the bit. Over the last year I’ve noticed over Instagram and Snapchat stories that my two friends have been constantly hanging out together without me and not asking whether or not I want to come. We haven’t had an argument or anything to cause this to happen it just happened. But I’ve also noticed over the last year that they’ve gotten heavily into alcohol, weed and going to parties. I personally would never do these things since I’ve seen first hand how bad it can ruin you from my dad who I haven’t seen in years now. I don’t hate people or Judge people who drink or smoke it’s just something I’d never do. My friends constantly say to me “oh come on you should take a hit” or joke around about how I haven’t had a girlfriend or similar things I just tend to brush them off as harmless jokes. It seems to me though that the rare amount of time I actually get to speak to them, it’s only when they feel like it never when I want to talk or play games/hang out. I have tried to ask them if they want to do something cause I’m bored and they just say something like can’t I’m hanging with someone else today or can’t going out to a party. I’ve gotten to the point where I haven’t spoke to them for maybe over a month or two and I always see their stories of them hanging out having fun. I also haven’t left the house to hang out with anyone for months maybe even a close to a year. It’s starting to get incredibly lonely but I’ve somehow accepted it and keep saying to myself that I actually enjoy it this way but deep down I know I don’t. This really isn’t me I miss the old me and my old friends which I lost due to wanting to hang out more with these two who I am also now losing. It’s getting incredibly hard for me to make conversation with anyone but family, I am socially awkward and can’t stand crowds. I lost my old happy funny self that everyone loved. 

(Sorry for the long post which kinda turned into a rant haven’t had anyone to speak about this to so I needed to get it all out)"
depression,"Schools reopening My last school year consisted of me crying in the bathroom and if I didn't make i couldn't go, I would silently try my hardest not to burst into tears in the classroom. Mostly because I was going thru some truama at the time and my friendships with people were very rocky. 

 Since quarantine, it was somewhat better bc I could cry in my own room and nobody would know. I could just turn the screen away since cameras weren't needed and not pay attention if I was overwhelmed and could relax. I did not feel the gaze of 30 other people staring and judging me and I didn't feel like I had to curl up into a ball and want to dissappear. 

Now schools reopening and I have lost all my social skills, I can't stand being around people, and my best friend doesn't go there anymore and he was like the thing that kept me grounded. I dont go to the zoom classes alot bc I oversleep and i haven't pay attention or done homework in a long time. I dont know how I'm going to cope.  I just don't know what to do."
depression,"Ramblings of a bloke It’s hard to not feel sorry for myself, I’ve battled anger issues, anxiety, depression and substance abuse. I’m proactive on being better and moving forward, I’ve got a beautiful partner and a job which for me is crazy but life always throws curve balls at me. I’ve had guns pointed at my head, meat cleavers swung at me, my house raided by police and criminals, even people try kill me. I’ve lost my family, although I really couldn’t care less about that. My father figure who took me in at 14 killed himself in 2018, my best friend overdosed and died in 2018, all my friends now don’t talk to me or are in jail. I’ve got work friends and that’s about it. 

I’m not seeking sympathy, I’d go as far to say I’m not as depressed as I use to be. I’m beyond the point of being depressed now, I get sad, I cry and feel like shit and blame myself for the friends I’ve lost but I try focus on a brighter tomorrow. 

I’m not posting this with any intentions other than to get it off my chest, I just feel like I needed to get it out. I can go into detail if anyone would like me to elaborate but I merely just want to get this off my chest.

Sorry for any incoherence."
depression,"Just want to stop it Hey ,
So I'm a grade 12 student and due to the Pandemic I had online classes . I'm a sort of person who needs someone to be in the same vacancy as me to study . Having a family of doctors ( I want to be a software engineer) , they've been extremely busy nowadays , as a result I was home alone for majority of the days .


This may not seem much but cuz everything in school was simple , we had three tests since my academic year began and now I'm close to my finals. Each test consisted of only 3-4 chapters per subject which made me take it very easy . 


Fast forward to now , I'm Bombarded with projects , tests and my finals all together and there's no breathing room for me .

I fucked up this year , I know I did but I don't want to fail , I fucked up my recent test on my entire syllabus I just managed to scrape through . I don't want to fail , I should've taken it harder . I don't want to fail .


I became more and more depressed and anxious everyday and each time I think about suicide I can't do it as I know how it will affect my family and I can't do that to them . I just want to run away or atleast can LIFE STOP FOR ONE FREAKING DAY , I need that gap this sudden amount of stress and tests . I can't handle it and every day I cry for 1hr due to unbearable stress  . I don't know what to do.....I don't know what to do"
depression,"I’m just tired. I’ve isolated myself to the point where none of my old friends even remember me I’m sure. I always think about reaching out, but it’s been so long, so many messages and calls rejected and ignored just so I could be alone with my thoughts that I don’t think they’d want to hear from me. I feel like I have it better than most people, but I feel so empty inside. I just can’t help but feel like I’m the only person in the whole world, it’s like no one else exists and I’m all by myself. Unless I take large amounts of sleep aid I can’t sleep and my mind will wonder until I have to get up for work. I feel like my life is over and I’m only 25, it’s always felt like it was over. I constantly find myself arguing with my boyfriend, deep down I want him to leave me because he deserves to be with someone else, someone who isn’t a fucking mess. I’m a teacher, and my kids are the only thing keeping me here. Maybe it’s just me latching on for something, anything, to keep me here, but no one will ever love my students as much as I do and no teacher will ever care the way I do about them. If I leave, I feel like I’ll be failing them and that’s the only thing keeping me going anymore."
depression,"when you dont feel comfortable sharing, you go to the internet don't worry this is not a suicide note. although the last month has seen me battle with these thoughts that i believed i had escaped a while ago.

what was born when i was a child out of a feeling, misguided or not, of alienation and inadequacy has changed to that of hopelessness.

the last year has devastated my belief in my community, nation, humanity.

every religion on earth calls us to respect one thing

life

and today after hundreds of years of spreading this message, people all around me are giving their retort to this almost universal belief:

""no"".

the reasons are many but the consequence is one.

&amp;#x200B;

one thing that has helped me get through my thoughts of darkness in the past is the hope that the acts of today will help create a safer, fairer and cleaner world for the people around me and the people after me. a sense of human solidarity and purpose.i have been sacrificing whatever ""life"" i have to help reduce the spread, going even further to help those who refuse do so with a lower risk.

&amp;#x200B;

scientists in the south pole preserve the small pleasures of our earth in freezing tunnels deep below,

space agencies launch satellites into the silent abyss with maps of what we are.

these are not actions of self preservation. they're time capsules, warnings of our hubris and selfishness to whoever might come after us.

and is that ultimately the purpose of us? not to thrive or survive but to whither away and become warnings among layers of sediment.

&amp;#x200B;

another reason i have found for myself is the quest for beauty.

through art, nature, food. life is filled with so many joys and experiences why limit yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

while elected officials spurn the advice of the medical community and present us with their arbitrary decisions of how much human suffering is acceptable

i complain with hypocrisy splattered across my face as I make this decision every day of my life. i drive to work and the emissions i release cause water and food insecurity; i type these thoughts on a device made by companies who argue that preventing human suffering in their supply chain, from mines in Congo that would seem familiar to James Conrad to the factories adorned with suicide nets in China,would hurt their profits; the goods i sell, the product of my labour, comes from cotton that's either being picked by forced labour or is stripping vast amounts of land of their nutrients.

i contribute to suffering and i dont know how to remove myself from it. i dont know how to stop it. 

and that's the point of this.

suffering.

don't worry this is not a suicide note.

this long winded thought probably comes off as angsty and childish. but when you don't have anyone you feel comfortable sharing the words ""i'm struggling to find a reason to wake up in the morning"" you end up having that conversation in your head and the problem with ""talking to yourself"" is too complicated for me to try to express.

 this is not me feeling guilt for realizing my privileges.

this is me struggling to find a reason to wake up in the morning. this strength i've been trying to radiate for the last year has started to crumble. because what i thought we were, we aren't.

don't worry, i'm not pawning any responsibility onto the reader. I'm simply shouting into a different type of abyss and hoping that an echo finds it's way back with some semblance of hope."
depression,I keep trying to hold on to something but all it ever is is false hope I just want one thing to make it worth it but every time i force myself to believe that I’ve found it I fuck it up and I’m left like this and I can’t do it anymore because nothing will either make it worth it it’s all just filling the in between to try feel okay when I never will
depression,"I feel like I have ""fake"" depression now that I'm not in as bad of a place as I used to be. I was diagnosed with depression almost two years ago and have been on the road to recovery since with multiple ups and downs. And now I'm starting grad school in September. There's a disability services department there and depression is one of the things they work with.

The thing is, ever since leaving my previous job (which was causing a tremendous amount of stress) and moving back in with my family (which helps with the isolation aspect of COVID since that was also something I had struggled with ever since the pandemic started), I've been feeling better. That's not to say I don't have my dark moments but it's not as debilitating as it used to be.

But because my depression is less debilitating I'm having doubts about letting the disability services department know that I have depression. I feel like I'm ""faking it"" since right now it's not as bad as before, and honestly I feel guilty about reporting a mental illness when the symptoms might not be as bad as one might expect. I also feel like with grad school being a more stressful place than where I am in life right now there's no guarantee that things won't get worse for me. Plus, I'm still on my meds. All of this is confusing me right now and I'm going a little crazy thinking about this.

Sorry for any inconsistencies or gaps, this is very much a stream of consciousness thing that I needed to get out."
depression,"Kids TW This little boy saw my cuts and said that they are cool and asked me questions about what I use to cut myself with and stuff like that. He promised me that he wouldn't be it himself but he wanted to learn about it since he has friends who do the same thing. It kinda made me happy because he wasn't telling me to stop or was disgusted by it, he was just interested."
depression,"Random Thoughts at night (NSFW so It doesn't get taken down)  I used to be a kid with imagination a kid who loved to prance around imaging I wish some kind of knight or a soldier from a movie or show. I used to have a huge imagination at least I still remember who I was some people forget how happy they were as a kid. I'm still a kid or so they say I'm just a 13 year old a 13 year old without friends, imagination, a purpose, and happiness. why am I making this? I used to be so happy I wish I could go back and be a 6 year old again It was a good time. But no I have to continue on this journey of what of pain why? why so much pain? for what? I know I'm just a stupid 13 year old ""It's a hormonal thing"", ""you'll grow out of it"", ""just stop being sad"", ""why can't you be like your brothers"" -Mom. I won't it's not like that. I already know the truth this world is dangerous, hazardous, and unsanitary for our fragile minds and bodies. Call my soft a snowflake a wimp, But it's the truth if you agree with me or not. You just haven't realized it yet. Parents are selfish that's why they had me so I could fulfill their needs be their little fucking slave, What's a non-selfish reason to have kids? well there is none. I'm just writing my thoughts down that's why this is so random. Well since I'm already here even though I wish I wasn't I'm just going to talk about what is actually kind of nice about this worthless world, Food! Food is so good tasty delicious of course not everyone has the good food because this world is unfair as fuck. But I guess you have good landscapes beautiful mountains, lakes, deserts, forests, ponds, rivers, mountain rivers, lakes in volcano craters, volcanos, flatlands, farmlands, salt flats, tropical islands, tropical forests, rainforests, temperate forests, and there is more I just don't remember them. We'll not everyone can travel yes that's true what else is there on this forsaken world? We'll animals cats, monkeys, birds, frogs, rabbits, geese, dogs, bears, horses, ponies, goats, sheep, iguanas, lizards, anoles, fish, sharks, whales, starfish, deer, moose, waterbears, anemones, snakes. I don't remember anymore at this time. I mean it is 3:50 am where I live, I don't have good reception at night. So yea this was random but I just had to write this out. I have no life after all. Haha Good night or Good morning to whoever whom reads this. I'm the 13 year old piece of biological data that wants to delete it's genetics from this planet. Thank you for listening. I hope you have a good day for whatever reason your getting up in the morning :D"
depression,"I dropped a rock in the ocean yet again My parents and I, we have problems with each other. There's this wall between us, a wall that was slowly built, brick by brick, to the heights of today. Its not that I've never made an effort to reach the other side. I've earnestly and desperately tried countless times in my years growing up. In fact, its almost pathetic how I'm still trying to reach them, to talk to them, to this day. I'm not sure if you understand this feeling. It's like dropping rocks into the ocean, one rock per attempt. At first, there will be a splash when the rock first hits the surface of the water. Then it will slowly submerge into the bottom. You'd wait, you'd watch, and you'd even hope and expect for something else to happen, but nothing happens. The ocean today is just the same as it was an hour ago, a day ago. It is then at that moment, you realize that the rock you dropped was just one of many rocks lying on the ocean floor. Perhaps several months later, a year later, or several years later, the ocean changes, but it wasn't because of your rocks. Perhaps its global warming, perhaps its tectonic plates, perhaps its a undersea volcano, our perhaps its the expansion and growth of human society and technology. Ultimately, your rocks made a difference so little, that perhaps in this lifetime, you'd never see it's effects. You'd think it's the waiting that's most aggravating, but actually, it is the greeting the next morning that truly suffocates you. Regardless of the nature of my attempt the night prior, be it peaceful or be it aggressive, today, once again, its as if yesterday never came."
depression,"Any stories about people that help themselves? I have been coping with depression for a while now and been diagnosed with something along the lines of ""serious depressive disorder."" Even tried to take my own life last week. I've reached out for professional help in November last year, but I've been told that I won't be attending actual therapy for at least six months. Until then I know I'm able to talk to my sisters and friends that care so much about me.

However, I don't want to burden them with my problems and thoughts when I feel like they're not ""equipped"" to handle with my problems like a professional would. So between me not getting the professional help I need and me refusing to confide in my friends, I am kind of doing this lone wolf. Now my question is if you guys know any piece of media that involves a troubled character, preferably with mental health issues, getting out of their situation on their own, without relying on others? For example, protagonist of ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" fights his illness with the help of new people he meets. I would like a story where there isn't some kind of deus ex machina."
depression,"I was told I have psychotic Depression and I really don't know how to cope with hearing that. I was told I have symptoms of psychotic depression by my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago- I haven't started taking any sort of medication- or really have changed anything about my life. I am currently working full time- and also in school full time. I spend most of my time by myself, and if I'm not by myself it's because I'm at work- or I'm sleeping and I can't really resonate with being by myself because I'm asleep- but I'm no one ever really spends the night. 

I've been considering trying not to isolate as much- and maybe go out and learn to socialize with people but I'm partially not really sure that I'm ready to do that- because of where I'm at with the depression, and also a large part of me just feels happier when I'm alone because I don't really know if I am considered to be a people person, if that makes any sense, I know this might seem weird, but during covid I learned how to cope while being alone- and I found that to be something that was really helpful- so I guess a lot of me was just wondering if interacting with people tends to help depression with psychotic features- 

or if possibly maybe I shouldn't be interacting with people if I have psychotic features- also part of me questions whether or not the experiences I have are considered to be valid or not because I'm aware now that it's part of a diagnosis and the experiences are not real- if that makes any sense..anyway thanks for reading this if you did- I really appreciate it"
depression,It’s not wanting to die that makes me sad It’s having nothing to live for
depression,"Why is getting treatment so difficult? My depression is currently going untreated because they won't let me make a doctor's appointment. The local doctors office that I keep trying to call won't allow anyone to make appointments after 8:00AM and won't allow you to schedule an appointment for later in the week. As you all know, it's pretty damn difficult for someone with depression to get up so early a lot of the time so I'm literally being punished because of this. I've been trying to make an appointment every day for the past 6 fucking days with no luck. Why are they making it so hard to get treatment? It's almost as if they want us to suffer"
depression,"I’m so lonely I feel like I’m just rotting in my corpse doing the same pointless things every day. I’m going crazy being this alone for this long. Every time where I have attempted to open up to somebody who I think be a really nice girlfriend I’ve been rejected and mocked. Currently my only hope for “love” is to sit In my room on the verge of tears and to have a girl just magically appear in front of me... I need someone to care for, i don’t even care who it is anymore : I just need to get my mind straightened out. Maybe if I focus my entire life on this person it could make me forget how lonely I am inside. I romanticize every situation with the hopes that the other even slightly cares about me. I’m an ok person, my personality and my jokes make me look like an absolute pessimistic psycho. I swear I’m okay, I swear. I just need a chance to show you all. Nobody after meeting me will want to date me. Maybe I haven’t found the right person, maybe I wasn’t at the right place, maybe... maybe.. It’s just been so long since I’ve even had hope about this kind of stuff anymore. I really wish what people say are true and not another lie to stop me from kms, I really do want a relationship, I want to love someone; know what love feels like, what joy feels like. I miss that feeling, joy. Please someone, talk to me. I’m here, always have been."
depression,Another day Dear god what is the point
depression,"I'm sure that I am the cause for my problems I just want to vent. 

What the hell is wrong with me ? I'm just a failure.....I am convinced that I caused my problems myself... I got diagnosed with bipolar. But I am questioning this diagnose. W/e

I guess I am just stupid or lazy.  Well I am pretty sure I am just lazy. I always started a new course of study never finishing it. Now I don't know what to do. I need to find a job but I have no fk clue what I want to do. Whenever something comes into my mind I tend to switch my goals or preferences or whatever. So I don't even get started. This is bullshit. I am wasting my life by being too indecisive.

Maybe I am just super lazy and actually don't want get shit done. I lack motivation and drive.

I am super unorganized too. I can't handle basic stuff. My Health insurance just sent me a letter that they will cancel my familiy membership and I have to pay on my own. I could have avoided that. They sent me a few letters a while ago which I just had to fill out and I still would have been insured w/o paying. Now I am scared that I can't afford it and have to pay the last few months fees back since my familiy membership ended in july last year. But I can't afford it atm since I do a shitty payed job. How stupid can someone be? I am not even able to fill out a letter in time. And now it could cause me some serious trouble. Man it's a fucking letter. How stupid can someone possibly be? I don't get it. It's super basic stuff that I am unable to do.  

I am my own worst enemy.

But tbh. I really don't even care. I don't fk care. It's all so useless. I am useless. I don't want to live life when that means I have to do a job I don't want to do just for the sake of surviving. I can't cope with stress. Most people would say ""well. maybe just tell them (insurance) your situation and that you have been unable to do the paper in time since you were depressed"". Thats actually an opportunity but I am too scared to do this. I am scared that they say I#m stupid for even trying. I rather try to pay the bills by working more than confessing my mistakes. Like wtf. But maybe I am not scared. Maybe I just don't care enough and give myself an easy excuse. I feel like my problems could all have been avoided if I just wouldnÄt be a weak person. All my problems could have been avoided with ease. But I am just to stupid/lazy/ignorant/unorganized etc...

I feel like I am a super manipulative eprson too. I can't even explain it. I tend to lie a lot. Most of the time i don't evebn realize doing it. What I know is that I don't do it with abd intention. But I second guess eveything I say to the point where I don't believe my own statmnents and feel like I tried to manipulate people into thinking y or z. 

I am not a bad person. But I guess I am still toxic. I don't want to be toxic but I am, I guess. I feel my depression getting worse latley. But I actually believe that I am just a crybaby. I feel like I don't deserve therapy. There are people with huge problems and I am just a crybaby to inmature to handle life whining infront of his therapist...

I need to get so much fixed. I feel like I have to fix my life to fix my mental state while at the same time  I feel like I have to fix my mental state before I can start fixing my life. It is a vicious circle.

Ah I wanted to stop right here. But since I started venting I just continue and get rid of all this shitty thoughts. Excuse me pls.

Holy crap I can't connect with people. I don't know why. Well, I am not even trying. I reached out about my problems. But people can't handle it. I feel like a burden. But I can't talk ""normally"" since I don't have anything else to talk about. I just want help. But I am scared that I push people away by being a burden to them so I started to shut down again. I pretend that I am living a good life and that I am a good person when I'm actually not. I mad a promise to my mother to fight depression but I feel like I don't even want to. I can't even do it for my mom. How the fuck am I supposed to do this for my own sake.

This is bs. I never used my potential. I was always told ""how good I've could become in x y z if I just tried"". Wwell. I never tried lol. I never tried hard enough to achieve anything. II nearly did everything in my life half-hearted. Now I have to carry the consequences.

I don't know what to do. I should just get a  vocational training. Fix my paper works. Get rid off my debts and start reconnecting with friends. This should be easy tasks. Just write a fucking application. Fill out some letters and call a friend to go drink a cup of coffee. But I can't. I just don't care enough. But at the same time I can so much that I get worried about thinking not doing it. It's paradox.

Maybe I am just a failure. Maybe it is just depression. W7e. It is just sad....Thank you for listening.

English is not my native language so pls excuse my grammar/spelling"
depression,"I'm pretty much certain that my relationship is going to end very badly for me but I ignore really obvious red flags so I can pretend to be happy until it does. My girlfriend is super shady and volatile. When things are going good I'm really, really happy to be spending time with her, but it's pretty clear there's other guys in her life. She barely tries to hide it. I know that this is going to end badly, with me being really hurt, but I'm too afraid to end things because I was so miserable before meeting her that I don't want to go back to that, and also because, as long as I do my best to ignore all of the clear and obvious signs that this is going to end very badly for me, I *am* really happy for most of the day, pretty much every day, as long as I'm spending time with her.

I know what I should do, and all of the reasons why I should, and I know that I'm really digging myself deeper and deeper and that as hard as it would be to just break things off right now, it's only going to be much, *much* harder if I let it continue, I still can't bear to do it. I just kind of continue to resign myself to the delusion that ""well, you never know, maybe things will just work out in the end,"" even though they clearly aren't going to."

I want to be an engaged student but I just don't understand anything, whenever a get a phonecall or text from work it takes me forever to build up the courage and energy to answer and chores are just piling up at home, I really need to vaccuum and do laundry and dishes and all that, but it just keeps piling up and I just can't

* My mom always tells me that this is a good thing, that a lot of people wish they could be like me, but come on, who wants to be ""me"", who wants to not be able to talk to anyone, not being attractive to any girl and being loved just because you're smart, she tells me that elder people like me, I mean, if I wasn't the smartest person of the room they wouldn't notice me a bit.
* I'm known in my school, not as the cool guy, not as the flirty guy, not as the nice guy, but as the **smart fuc\*ing kid**. All of my ""friends"" are so loved that I just think God doesn't want me to be happy, they're all funny, socially skilled, attractive, and then there's me, a 16 years old who only has his brain...

depression,"Feeling absolutely depressed after finding out that the girl I was talking to for 3 months was dating someone else the whole time A few minutes ago I was on Facebook and the girl that I was talking to popped up in my suggestions. She ghosted me like a week ago and I was doing better so I have NO CLUE why I decided to go into her profile, from there I ended up in the guy’s profile that she posts now on Snapchat. 

The problem is that on that guy’s profile, there are pictures of him being on dates with her during the whole time she was talking to me. I KNOW talking stage is not official but she told me multiple times I’m the only one she’s talking and that she’ll make it official as soon as she comes back, even tho I knew to some degree that wasn’t true I still believed her. 

But now I’m finding out that she was with him the whole time. After seeing all those pictures of them together from the time she was “with me” and her comments on every picture saying “I love you”, I’m feeling absolutely betrayed and I don’t know why and what to do about this feeling. I just wanna end feeling like this"
depression,"Horrible parents and I cant heal 
My parents have never been sympathetic at all with my mental health not even when i was at my youngest. When i was 12 my parents screamed at me and grounded me for cutting myself. When ever im crying or show any bit of emotion they will antagonise me saying whats that noise or try to upset me more in a way. Ive told them that i want to kill myself yet it has not changed their behaviour anyway they act like they dont believe me. I feel like i have wasted my teen years being depressed for 6 years and its horrible that my parents havent helped me but i still love them and some how put this past me sometimes yet every morning i wake up crying about this. But i just cant understand how they can act this way to me. When im older i feel like i am going to be more angry about this for maturity reasons but i dont want to live miserably anymore and i cant seem to move past this. Ive told them how i feel about it and they have nothing to say. I have tried the 2 counselling charites but none of them have got back to me and the nhs have told me there’s nothing more they can do. I honnestly dont know what i want to do and it hurts to much to talk to my friends about it and i dont want to put the burden on them. I really need some advice.
Thanks to anyone who helps"
depression,Bittersweet I had an ex-gf. We were together for 5 years. When she left me she told me that she fell out of love and i accepted it. It was the hardest part of my life. After a year she came to me with a confession. That we have an unborn child. But when i was about to be the happiest guy on earth. She breaks her silence and told me that she had her miscarriage. Up until now days have past. Im always feeling this guilt and anger. I always want to have a family on my own. It was so close for having a taste of life but yet so far. I lost a child and it will be in my memory forever.
depression,"What to do if depressed loved on doesn't want help? Last week, I asked for strategies here for me and my gf on how to cope with the lockdown and being apart while she has her breakdowns.

Last week, she said yes to cold showers and morning walks as some of you here suggested - she had some cold showers and we kept postponing the morning walks until this morning she doesn't want to get up her bed. I told her to do the stuff I tell her because it would make her feel better but she doesn't want to and tells me she just wants to die.

What can I do to make her want to do things that would help her?"
depression,"I'm trying to fight my depression for 10 years. Too tired. I'm living in Russia and i think i did my best here. But no matter how hard i tried, it always ends the same. And this is the first time i feel like i'm really really tired to fight... 

Firstly, i'll start with my condition. I'm fighting depression for like 10 years. With height 180 i weight 47kg. Why so bad? Bacause i have no appetite. Did i tried to fix that? Absolutely. I hit a gym for 3 years with a coach (thanks god he's my friend and i don't need to pay). I know about lifting a lot but not eating enough is the main problem. No matter what, you just can't eat enough with depression.

  
I'm 29 yo and living with my very old granma, which is very hard to deal with. Not only her health is bad, but her character is even worse, everyone's hates her. She's literally draining my life. But i don't need to pay for a home at least. Let's continue... Education. I've studied in US University for 1 year and actually did pretty well. That was the happiest time and my life. But... in 2014 Crimea has fallen to Russia and our ruble has fallen with it. Sadly me and my parents couldn't afford it anymore and i've returned.  People around here always smiling and i felt alive, made many good friends and etc. So, i returned and tried just to find a job and move on. Sadly, without education in this country you can only work on crappiest jobs. I tried anyway, but all my chiefs were sociopaths. They've looked at me and talked to me like i'm not worth living. And even my friend which i'm worked with said that co-workers trying to break me just because i'm not weight enough. When they can't, they're getting angry at me and sometimes fired me for that. Beign russian is tought on that matter. I've never acting weak in front of people tho. So i tried, tried and again, and again....  in the end i found a job online. It's very small payment and i can barely buy food and things i need. I feel like i have no more strenght to work in real life.  


You know, looking back at my life, i can say i did my best. Yes, i did mistakes and still do. I kept saying ""in spite of it all"" to myself. Have you ever met a guy in a gym who never missed workout for 3 years, made no progress and still hitting the gym? If you've been here, you can imagine my character. But in the end result is always the same for me. Most of the time it just out of my control. But this time i'm just really really tired. My grandma didn't believe in corona, catched it and ofcourse infected me with it. I've paused my gym for half a year and isolated myself for her, but she didn't care at all. It ended well for both of us but fight was a hard. My friend died because of it. Then my mother had an ilness but it also ended well. Now my 17 yo cat dying and i can't do anything about it. My result in the gym is getting worse because i'm too tired mentally and almost not eating. I skipping my work a lot, just because i'm sick of it and also feeling tired. I tried to find a good doctor, but remember, this is a Russia. They're just saying i need a better job, a family and vitamins, that i'm a smart guy and bla bla bla. The worst part - for many years i feel like i've made no progress on my life. Literally 0. In spite of trying my best. I have no idea what can i do better in this country. This country is poor and without education i can't get a good job. Without money and education i can't escape it ether. I can't cure depression because healthcare is a joke and i probably not gonna have enough money for pills anyway. I can't get a weight because i'm in depression. Real life job is toxic because i'm not looking tough and manly (which is really important in russia). Beign 29 yo loser doesn't helps either. Can't talk about it with my family after they said to me that i should accept low payment job and just find a wife, then live a poor like them. I hate that mentality. 

What can i even do? For the first time i feel like i'm going to give up on my life. Who said hope can't die? In my case i have no direction anymore, i've run of ideas. Feels like i almost not care anymore. For past year i'm not even sure if i felt anything. No sadness, no joy... just struggling and fighting. And i'm tired. Not gonna kill myself, but... i don't know. I just want to lay here and sleep for the rest of my life.

depression,"Seriously. How do you work. Why do you work. I just don't get it. I've been living on my own since I was 16 and I still don't understand how I'm going to keep a job. I'm 21 now, and between 16-21 I've had 22 jobs. Between those periods, I've quit jobs just to sit at home and do nothing. I don't understand how people can have one job from highschool, through finishing college. I just don't get it. Am I envious? Yes. Are their lives going to turn out better than mine? Yes, but sometimes I'd rather spend  all my money on weed and get high than work at some shitty place that doesn't respect me. Do I have a future? No. But that's okay because I've decided I'm not making it past 30."

As a result Im unable to focus on a task bc of my Intrusive thoughts and ADD, like, ITS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO READ. And Im also talentless, ugly and a boring person. I also made some really HORRIBLE actions in the past that i will never forgive myself, but i promise im 100% not that person anymore.

The internet is the only place i can tell about it, but if i ever tell someone irl, they'll undoubtedly hate me and abandon me, even if i dont identify with my past anymore.

depression,"Life is getting difficult Hello world,
My life feels as if it is going through a downward spiral,

I am currently 24 years old as of now, I am 6,3 and am in relativity good physical health I graduated from my college  with a degree in Eléctrical and computer engineering and after two years of searching I found an IT job to be a part of. 
Around 6 years ago my father lost his home and has been living with my and my mother at the moment. This man before that was my hero my god and I saw him as the man but since he’s moved in and even before then he has made life very miserable for me and my family. He is verbally abusive to me my mother and my sister and now brother (transitioning) there are huge arguments almost every week and every few months or so the police show up to deal with it. It is horribly painful to deal with and even worse is that despite all that he has been doing I still love him and need him as when I was younger him and I have formed a bond even worse is that my father is in poor physical and mental health and the thought of him not being with me kills me inside. We have tried to get rid of him but he is on the lease of the apartment and cannot be kicked out unlike us. If something were to happen to him then likely the landlord will try to remove us and that terrifies me given my dads Health

I have an almost nonexistent relationship with my mother who raised me and my siblings. She is one of the most difficult cult and hardheaded people I know. I have dealt with a lot of bullying when I was younger and I’ve gained PTSD from it but dispite this I managed to overcome the abuse and toxic energy I gained from going to shitty public schools and earned a bachelors degree and IT job but I feel so empty. 

I have never had a girlfriend but I’ve been sexual with some women who either weren’t interested in me after or I lost interest in them. I’ve been feeling incredibly lonely as a result. 

I’m struggling in this job I get overwhelmed in it and I somewhat feel I am not smart enough to do it. I’ve received some complaints from my managers in the 6 months I’ve been there. 

I’ve been feeling so lost and hopeless like there is a massive void in my heart and I feel like i’m wandering and doing work with no reward. I feel suicidal. I feel like there is no end to the pain and hardship bad I should just end it all but I want to continue i really do. If anyone could give me any advice it would appreciate it immensely."
depression,"Whatever happens, happens. Im getting tired again. I dont know if its just the last couple of days but im tired. Not physically tired but it feels like my everythings tired.. like my souls finally giving out. Needing sleep. Im hurt. Letting go hurts. People I care about hurt.loving hurts.My everything hurts. 

To be completely honest I know its getting bad again but I'm not going to try this time. Im not going to try and get better anymore. Its been three years. Im done. Im finally done. Whatever happens, happens. Im sorry conor but I can't do this anymore..i miss your voice.i miss your hugs. I miss your presence..I miss you."
depression,"I don't feel like a human Humans work. Humans have lives. Humans get it. I don't get it. I don't have a future. I didn't do any work in high school and dropped out, I've lived on my own since 16.  I've had so many jobs that noone in their right mind would hire me. I will never go into a fulfilling career because I'm too fucking lazy to commit to anything. I've tried. I will never finish my tattoo because of my pain tolerance. I will never be happy because I'm too high maintenance. I just want to kill myself. I just want to die. My life just feels like a bad joke."

depression,"Dealing with a depressive episode while feeling violated I feel terrible because I had lied to everyone, including myself, about how I got pregnant. It wasn't consensual and I'm struggling with feeling okay while trying to manage my growing depression along with feeling out of sorts in my own body ever since.

Last month I met up with an old ex who I was in an LDR with and had never met, it had been four years since we had talked. He was leaving state and I decided that it might be a good idea to meet him before he goes because he had seemed like he had changed(at one point he was verbally abusive and also obsessive). A lot of my friends thought this was a bad idea, that I let him back into my life. I was even told it would end badly. 

I had just gotten out of a relationship back in December and lost a baby on new years and I thought it would be a good way to heal or get out of my comfort zone as well. And this ex was very supportive of me and seemed to really care for me as a friend. 

There were a lot of red flags, and yet I thought that since it was a month long relationship only that even if he caused me problems he would be out of state by then. I thought I could handle myself. He seemed hesitant at first because I had been through a lot and he didn't want to hurt me, so I just felt even more comfortable because he seemed like a good guy.

Yet I was too embarrassed to tell them that there were situations out of my control. He decided to go without any protection halfway through and when I noticed he refused to get off. 

Afterwards it was like nothing had happened to the point where I'm even beginning to doubt my memory of the situation. I'm confused as to why he did what he did and what his intentions were. I cried and told him how it was his fault and how I hated him and he held me and told me that he was sorry, how he lost control. And that if anything happened he wouldn't be like other guys, he wouldn't up and leave me. How we would be together forever and that he had waited four years to see me. He even brought up marriage even though I had rejected him 4x over dating, and now he wants to skip to marriage? I even rejected him that same day but it was like his mind didn't even register it. He kept telling me how I had feelings for him even though I told him I didn't. Creepy comments that showed how he was still obsessive. 

I never told him I was pregnant, I don't intend to. 

My depression is making things worse. I feel like all of my friends hate me. I lied and told them it was an accident even though it really doesn't feel like one. I lied to everyone. I feel like a burden to everyone. I hated hiding it. Everyone blamed me for it because I wasn't on a birth control because I was in the middle of switching. I also just didn't expect to do anything. I just got fed up of being the only one who had to take responsibility when I just want someone to hold me and tell me things will be okay.

I feel disgusted with myself and I'm trying very hard to try to love the baby but I'm also still grieving from losing my last one. Grieving and also feeling violated. I feel conflicted and confused lately. Everything is confusing.

My depression makes it so I want to just stay in my room curled up in bed and not leave. I'm tired of myself and tired of feeling like I look strange. I feel uncomfortable in my own body and nothing seems to be going right. I feel at fault, as if I'm guilty or that I did something wrong. And I feel embarrassed because everyone warned me and I didn't listen.

I feel unwanted, unneeded, and as if my friends will no longer want me around. On top of having depression, I now have to heal during an episode and I honestly just feel overwhelmed and exhausted.

I feel numb at times as well, and even when I want to cry I find that nothing comes out. I feel alone mostly as well."
depression,"Emptiness Four years ago I tried to  kill myself by hanging an that was the moment I realized I could not do it at all. I don't have the courage. My depression and anxiety was so bad, they made me threw up almost everyday back then. Two years ago I decided to get help. I had been take  fluoxetine and ambient about half a year. The made me gain weight and I got easily irritated. I would not say I got better. I try to be an optimistic nihilist as my therapist suggested since everything in life does not matter. But every now and again I feel this deep feeling of unhappiness. I try to set goals in life. If I made this much money then I'll be happy etc. But still that deep feeling of unhappiness. The feeling that I'm nothing. There are so many things in life that I have missed out because of my mental health. Although I have not tried to kill myself I still have a death wish. I swim and dive in the ocean alone hoping that I would run out of breath and passed out. Everyday I wake up thinking the life I could have had, has gone. Ten years ago I never would have thought in a million years that this could be my life. I lost so many people and so many things.

depression,"Quitting another job Except this one was my first “real” job. I got a job as a high school teacher, but I took over a classroom halfway through the year. That is hard enough, but it’s also in the middle of a pandemic. My mood stabilizer was working well enough, but it seems like this job is pushing past even that. I was hypomanic like 2 weeks ago and really doing well. Thought I had finally done something with my life. Now I’m back in a depression. 

I’ve come to realize that I need to find a job with flexibility. Having this job where I HAD to come every single day at the same hour and was expected to be responsible for 180 kids ended up being a lot for me. More than I expected. I’m going to take a couple classes on computer science in hopes I can find a job more flexible in that field. Plus, I did love coding back in college. But honestly, I really don’t think I’m cut out for working. It feels like I’ll never be stable in a long term job. It just feels impossible for me to do without constantly landing myself in a clinic. 

Thankfully, my parents are still letting me live with them at 22. I know they’re getting frustrated with me, but I’m grateful for what they’re giving me until I can get myself together (if I ever do). 

Anyway, I’m typing this at work right now before class starts. I’m probably turning in my resignation effective immediately when I get home tonight."

I have been depressed since i was around 14 years old. Ive had anxiety since i was 5. At 5 years old I broke out of my school and walked out with the intention of finding a car to hit me. This is not normal, and i remember the situation well even though it was a long time ago. When i was a teenager i felt comfort in that what i was experiencing would maybe pass as i get older but it hasn't. I have a loving family and a few friends, but my relationships have all been terrible. I don't do dating or love anymore. I have tried therapy, medication and self medication but nothing has worked long term. Im at a point now where i feel i am doomed to walk through life with a hole inside me and no way of filling it.

depression,"I bend who I am depending on who I am with So I have this issue, I make myself really small whenever I am confronted with any situation where I might get criticised, get judged, get rejected at. I'll give you a few examples:

I am sitting outside on a bench in the park and I am watching a video on my smartphone. All I can think of is how others must think I am a loser for watching a video on my smartphone in the middle of a beautiful day alone by myself.

Other situation, I am smoking a cigarette in the smoking area, and I start cleaning my rolling material. The filter bag makes sound when I put it in my pocket, and I try really hard not to make a sound so as to not bother anyone.

Other situation, I listen to a friend giving me unwanted advices and I keep noding ""yes, huhu, yes, mhhm, yes"" even though I don't want to talk about it

In my head, I spend all my time trying to figure out what is right for others, I get headaches also. 

I try doing the opposite of those behaviors, but sometimes it simply doesn't work. For example there aresituations you cant do anything about, such as when listening to a video outside. Nobody is complaining to me, it's all happening in my head. I am just wired that way, I get scared of people, get scared of rejection.

Now that I write all this, it seems obvious that confrontation is the solution to my problems, but like I said, when I am sitting outside watching a video, there s nothing to confront. Although I could keep watching the video until I calm down? Anyways.

I appreciate all advices thank you."

depression,"Discussing the Same Issues Over and Over After a conversation with a friend yesterday, I (25M) realized I’ve been having the same conversations with the same people about the same issues over and over throughout my life. For example, I’ll talk about dealing with social or romantic issues, they’ll give advice or comfort me. Then at some point later (sometimes days, sometimes months), we’ll have basically the same conversation again. Sometimes it feels like I’ll retread the same points within the same conversation 

This has been happening with friends, family, even therapists for a long time, and I feel like it’s turned a lot of people in my life off or at least affected my dynamic with them. It’s like somewhere in my mind, I’m resisting or second guessing what they’re telling me even if I totally agree with them. Sometimes I’ll take the advice for a bit, then just stop for no reason. 

My friend last night told me she feels like she’s being a band-aid to me, and that choice of words really stuck with me because I realize that’s all I’ve ever done. I’ve always used complaining to other people as a way to temporarily relieve my pain and frustration. Most of the time, I delay the problem indefinitely, and of course, the same things keep biting me in the ass. Sometimes I take their advice to heart but always fall back into the same habits or new bad habits. 

I want to break this cycle, but I frankly don’t know where to start. Even though I’m still young, I feel like time keeps slipping by, and I’m still fighting the same battles."

I don't think I've ever felt pain like this before to the point of where i wish i could join her just so i can see her again. I feel guilty for still being here when she isn't. I was feeling depressed before but now i feel like I'm left in this world alone and idk what to do. She was my rock but cancer took her away from me. The consultants didn't tell her she was dying until the day before she passed and that breaks my heart. I didn't even get to say goodbye due to covid. I haven't watched any TV or been on my laptop the entire time. I can't focus on anything. I feel like im drowning and there's nobodies hand there to pull me from it. I lived with my mum and my brother and he just hides in one room away from me so i am left alone all the time and all i think about is my mum and wishing i could see her again. I can't take this pain. People keep telling me it's grief but it's not grief. I literally want to die so i can see her again. I had the negative thoughts depression before without suicidal thoughts but now it's got to that stage. I keep getting told to keep myself busy but busy doing what. I have anxiety and i haven't been able to leave the house in 10 years only once to attend my dads funeral last year. I grieved for one parent then i lose my other parent. I feel like a failure and a fraud. What do i focus on? How do i feel better? Would i see my mum again if i did harm myself? Will i even have a life beyond now? Since she died i gave muself these little goals and aspirations that i know she would have wanted for me but my anxiety is going to stop me doing those things. I'm trapped, ill never have a good life. But I'd feel guilty leaving my brother on his own. Idk what to do"
depression,"Turned 40 today. One more lost decade of life down. Today is my 40th. There hasn't been a single year, month, or day over my 30's that I wouldn't have gladly blinked out of existence. I've wished for it every day. 

The previous decade, my 20's, I was in a deep pit of ruining my body and living as a zombie, hating myself and my life and wanting to die every minute.

The previous decade, my teens, was spent depressed and angry and hating life. Hurting myself and wanting to die. 

There hasn't been a single year that wasn't marked by wishing I would die. 

So what will these next 10 years bring? It's pretty fucking obvious. I've tried and done everything about depression, many psych drugs, many other drugs, many years of therapy, all the lifestyle stuff people recommend. I've been in love, had it all; there is just nothing here for me. Things aren't going to somehow turn around now, in my 40's. My brain does not work in a way that is survivable long term. 

So cheers to one more decade of waiting out my parents' lives.

depression,"My sister [F18] shows signs of self harm and I don't know if my parents are in a position to help. Hi. I don't know if this the best subreddit to post this on but I literally made an account for this.

So I'm 21 and male  and I never was extremely close to my sister, meaning we never shared secrets or talked about personal stuff, but we sometimes joke around and talk about various things in general. This year I learned that  she used to do things in secret (like smoke or drink) and it seems to me that she is going through depression although she never told me so. A few weeks ago something happened between her and her friends and I found her drunk and with cuts in her hands. 

After I spoke with my mother about it she told me that she (my sister) is seeing a psychiatrist for the last month or so. 

The problem is my parents don't seem to be in a position to help. My mother seems to get angry towards her every time she does something bad and I don't think she is ready to  accept a reality in which her daughter is cutting herself. I believe that makes my sister even more isolated and depressed and when I try to speak to my mother about it she is very defensive saying she is doing the best she can. 

They lockdown has made things even worse as my sister is not able to see any of her friends and is always closed in her room.

I recently found bloody papers in the bathroom bin that made me very sad and afraid that she is need of help. I have no idea what to do. I told her (without saying anything about the self harm) that im here if she even want to talk and I plan on telling her again soon. 

Im feeling really down with this situation and I wish there was a way to make my parents treat her more lovingly and sympathetically. What should I do to help, considering she already seems to have a psychiatrist?

I’m starting Zoloft soon and am terrified. I know people that have committed suicide from antidepressants (albeit very extreme antidepressants) and am terrified of that. I view myself as creative and the complete opposite of academic (the reason I even started therapy thanks college) and I am really really scared of losing that.

depression,"Life is depressing I don’t know anymore, we have more options than ever before to do whatever but I just find myself not knowing what I should do or the point in much, I used to come on Reddit and see interesting things which I still do but coming on here I have also seen all the bad things happening to people every day, it makes it hard to be happy about much knowing that, it puts you in your place realising millions of people go through the same things and much worse

depression,"A promise to myself Today I am making a promise to myself, that I intend to keep for the rest of my life, whether it hinders or helps.

Today I am putting up walls around me. I wont let anyone get close to me, and I will not get close to anyone. I will not trust anyone. I will not trust myself, either.

I tend to get attached to people. I then let my guard down, and this allows me to get hurt. It's because I quickly realize that the other party does not, in fact, care about me. At least not as much as I thought. No fault but my own, of course. I'm not blaming anybody for not caring about me. For realizing what kind of person I am and getting the fuck out of dodge. This is a smart move on their part. I'm moody, unstable, childish, annoying... I deserve to be mentally imprisoned. Nobody deserves to burden my emotional ups and downs. I apologize to the people forced to be around me on a daily basis. It really must be tiring."
depression,"I Feel Like I Had A Mid-Mid Life Crisis 29 Y/O, Male, Married, No kids.

This past year has really heightened my depression and I finally feel it. From being upset day to day that a certain percent of this country was okay with everything that Donald Trump is/was, to a large percent of the country not caring about their fellow man and not wearing masks/being covid smart, it’s really just accelerated by depression. On top of that I’ve been an alcoholic for the past 4 years and that’s of course not helping anything.

My marriage is okay. I make a great salary. My job is meh. I’m just at a point where I’m so upset with humanity that it makes it hard to see any light in this world. I have been thinking more and more about how I’d rather be at peace dead than be mad at the world.

After having these feelings I keep telling myself that I need to ignore the shitty world that we live in and just focus on myself and my wife, it’s just hard when I studied history and political science in college and the current state of the world is important to me. 

On top of that I have 0 social life now because of covid WFH and I’m just depressed being alone everyday while my wife has to go into work (nurse).

I’m looking for advice on quitting drinking and seeing/finding the light in the world/life and not dwelling in the darkness of this world. It all just seems so bleak and hopeless most days."
depression,"Ways of Helping Fortunately for the most part for myself I have a fairly healthy mental health. And as I grow up/older I continue and try and understand what others do experience. 

My girlfriend (now ex) of ~7 months has hit rock bottom. Even though everything in life is, from my stand point, going her way now between relationships, future, health, etc, she is more depressed than ever. When we met, she was still a little hurt from her ex boyfriend and having problems with her currently divorcing parents. Since then those two things have greatly improved, not issues anymore, but I think deep down she's still traumatized from her past. Her childhood. How men treated her in the past. Things family members have said. I don't think she knows what love looks like, or at least how to accept it. So when I came along, she loved me to no end, but had a difficult time accepting that I loved everything about her.

I know deep down she still loves me. Underneath all of the depression. It's a disease. A week ago today she broke up with me and yesterday she told me how she misses me so much, thinks we can get back together at some point, and ""by accident"" told me she loves me. Then hours later she broke down saying she scared herself and she doesn't know what she wants.

Months back she said that she is numb to everything around her. Which makes sense because she no longer listens to music, sings, draws, all of the stuff she use to love doing. We still did what we loved doing together but I don't think it wasnt as much fun for her. And we always talked before going to try and lift her spirits. I tried making the best of it. Stuck with her. Complemented her. I truly made her happy for a while but the newness of the relationship wore off, as normal. And I think that's when things began to go down hill.

She started taking meds about a month ago.. I can't say she's  getting any better, if any, she's getting worse. She has an appointment for counseling for some time in May, but she needs help now. I try to keep her spirits up, not leave her alone but I also don't want her to push me away. Space is needed, yes I know, but it also isn't always good..

So is there any other way I can help her for the time being?? 

I can handle helping and taking care of myself.

Tl;dr: What are other ways of helping a loved one besides meds and therapy?"

My girlfriend is an artist and makes more money than I did when I slaved at FedEx Office working 60+ hours a week. 

I quit my job because i was mentally in a very bad place, applied for unemployment-and found out today that after 1 month of waiting, they decided I do not qualify for unemployment. So now I have no income, and my gf doesn't make enough for me to NOT work for a long period of time. 

I feel like I can't work again, because I am on a suicidal tight rope. I can't go to a therapist (no insurance, plus no income to pay). 

I was going to use my time off and unemployment money to help pursue my passion of Film and Photography, but I don't know if it is what I want to do. 

And now that unemployment didn't work out, I want to sell my $1400 camera and my $600 worth of equipment, sell my books(manga); just so I can have money.

depression,":/ I’m confused

So to make a long story short, for as long as I could remember my mental health has always been short of okay. So I would always be looking for the next fix to keep me in good standing. Recently I had gotten heavy into Mary and Jane.  It made me more productive, and I would just feel so much better mentally and physically. Even coming down from a high, I would be the best version of myself. However I also have self destructive tendencies, and Really just I like to smoke but I beat my body up so much, with tobacco, and nicotine, that it seems like it can only tolerate marijuana now. so in the spur of the moment I decided to rid myself of all streams of my income. Therefore I wasn’t able to annul my negative mental tendencies because buying It wasn’t in the cards financially, And I’m almost a week sober. I’m almost always described as “ mellow, or mild mannered” Now I’m watching myself deteriorate. I’m lashing out of people close to me (sometimes violently), Hurting myself, ruining opportunities to get stable financially, my anxiety is more and more frequent. Just last night I completely deleted my “digital thumbprint” because I thought the internet was my enemy. Believe it or not, this is me improving from what I used to be. But basically when I would partake and get high, the effects would change me into a completely different person, normal even.  I want to blame it on withdrawal, but I also have small history of addiction. There was a point in my life where I couldn’t eat or sleep without being drunk off my ass. (But I got alcohol poisoning so many times, I can’t even stand the smell of hand sanitizer) Or i couldn’t feel better than useless, unless I would be harming myself. All this to say, I know I’m not perfect and I probably should “seek help” ( like I’ve been hearing since I was born) but that idea just seems alien to me. I’m just not capable of opening up to receive it. For anyone else who’s taken breaks from smoking, have you had similar situations? Because I just feel like I’m issuing smoking as an excuse to address the real issue?"
depression,"The death routine Every morning that I just open my eyes and I realize I'm still alive I just sigh.  

Every minor activity, from making breakfast, to taking a bath, to getting ready for work is full of suicidal thoughts and how unfortunately Im not strong enough to just pull up a knife at that instant and just slit my wrists or arteries and get this shit done.

I get ready to work and sit on the edge of the bed and sigh once again because I couldn't build the strength to drown myself in the toilet nor draw that knife.  

I walk down to the bus stop and see the hills in the horizon and wish I could just build the courage to go there and just jump down and break myself. Even if I don't die from the fall, hopefully death would come soon due to my broken bones and limbs and possible internal bleeding.  

How it is possible to live and rest and be able to face the next day when every day I have to face this routine? How to not be anxious, stressed and depressed when just the small activities of existing seems so pointless and my mind screams and begs for death every second I'm not distracted enough?"

I thought this was supposed to make me feel better?"
depression,"Is this anxiety or depression? I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have depression, but my psychiatrist kept asking if I get anxious. Spent so long asking me about it, he didn't seem that bothered about my depression though. But I don't know how to recognize it. I know the definition, he explained it too, but I don't think I understand.

I definitely don't like new social situations and have avoided lots of social situations over the years, by staying at home and completely avoiding things. Is this anxiety?

This morning at work someone told me my work wasn't good enough in a call of 20 people, no specifics just not good enough (this is the third time she's done this). I asked her to email me with a list of specific things to change, she said she would. Now it's the afternoon, and I'm trying to work on other stuff. But I can't think of anything else, I play out situations in my head, like what I'll say in the future if she says this again, and I'm wracking my brain trying to think if I forgot or missed something.

Is this anxiety? Or is this just part of depression?

I often spend time in my head playing out future conversations that never happen, and how I would deal with them. These often make me pretty depressed."

if youre struggling pretend your life is a boxing match, in the blue corner, you, in the red corner, life, since the bell rang so many of us guys have been getting punched so hard swing after swing but every year is a new round, the punches you guys are receiving are leaving you dazed, confused, hurt and doubting your ability to carry on the fight, but your corner is your heart and your loved ones telling you youve got this and not to throw in the towel (not to harm yourself), you have so many rounds left, so now you have two options, you can win the fight with either coming back as strong as you can and land that big fat right hand to give yourself the lead and to keep swinging as hard as you can and go all out, which can be dangerous if youre doing everything blindly but can work, or, you plant your feet firmly back on the canvas, with the help of your corner take YOUR pace to get in the fight, you wont even need to punch back learn as you go along how to dodge these horrible blows, until you can dodge and counter and win the fight with points at your pace.

depression,"Hello again. Hello again, reddit.

Again I feel like I just need to get out some feelings in an anonymous form for some sort of relief. 

I posted a little while ago when I was in a dark slump, and I seem to have at least gotten past that episode.

Now, I've fallen into another one.

It's not like I got out of the last one and felt great, or felt normal. I felt neutral.

It's like going from I want to die and what is the point, to going to ok I guess this is just how this is and I just need to crawl through and then maybe at some point I can walk. Except you're crawling on spikes and it hurts. But I guess that's what this is isn't it? That's why this is so difficult to deal with.

And you don't want to tell people cause then you're dragging them down with you, and you don't want them to have to crawl with you. Or as I said in my last post, people seem like they have it so much harder and you don't want to dump your stuff on top of their stuff.

I have my birthday coming up and I'm turning 30, on march 28th to be exact,and I'm not even slightly excited.

I'm just going to be spending another birthday by myself. Turning another year old without any kind of achievement to my name.

I'll be a thirty year old woman, in a job that I'm probably terrible at and don't enjoy but I need to make money and been in a twelve year relationship with someone who refuses to live with me and wants to live on their own and I don't feel like I can tell the whole extent of how I feel mentally because it's embarassing and I'm scared . But that's an entire other conversation.

All I can think of is that I want everything to end. And that no one would really care."

I did tell her and requested but she wasn't able to see me anymore than just a really good friend even after trying. 

Since then I have cried and cried. I am unable to work, my appetite's literally gone. Been sleeping a lot just to get away from things. I would have surely committed suicide if it wasn't forbidden in my religion. It's like my world's falling apart right infront of me and I can't do a sh*t about it.

And I can’t afford private therapy or anything. I am really stuck. I’ve used suicide hotlines with instant chats and over email but it didn’t help at all.

My grandma usually just stays quiet and barely speaks, and when we do talk she usually just talks over me and talks about herself all the time, i cook meals, clean the house and do laundry by myself when were the only ones home together because she wont do anything unless asked. One of my “friends” will fully ignore what i just said and will talk about the same things for the entire day if he could, just now one of our conversations pissed me off because he asked how i was and for once i told the truth and said i felt like shit and he just replied with “hm” and then i asked how he was and he spoke about his day and acted like i never even said i felt bad, hes also said hes had a crush on me for like a year so i don’t understand why he’s ignoring me. I know it sounds really selfish of me to be talking like this but its really driving me crazy, whenever me and my mom are together for long periods we just fight and she calls me mean and doesn’t let me get a word in and if i do it just ads fuel to the fire.

Hell I tried so hard I was burned out, anxious and stressed out most of the time.

One of my source of depression was the place where I lived. It might not sound like a big deal (although I think you would understand), but we lived with non-stop construction noises coming from the flat right above us. And I'm not talking about hammering here and there. It was deafening power drilling from 8am to 4pm. I could not work properly (home office), my girlfriend - working afternoon shifts - was not able to use her mornings to rest.

&amp;#x200B;

I was depressed to begin with, and I thought moving to that place might give me some peace and time to recover, but basically the construction work began just as we moved in.

Eventually, after 5 months of restlessness (and after hearing ""just another week"" for countless times) we moved to a new place and it is miles better, both of us feel way better since we moved. Of course, being an apartment building, people will make noise from time to time. The only problem is, that every time I hear a 2 second drilling or a few hammer strikes, I get triggered. I instantly feel the anxiety and the tension building up in me, and I have to calm myself.  


I usually say stuff to myself like ""Don't worry, they'll stop soon, it's not like the other place. You like living here"".  And it is true, I'm not lying to myself, it's just hard to let go of these bad memories.  


Do you have similar experiences? How do you deal with them?"
depression,"Unemployed, alone, and scared I’ll never be happy 22M. 

Covid really took a shit on my life plans. I graduated college in May, and during the first semester of my senior year, I had always expected to get a job, move away, and create my own life. However, because of covid, i've been unemployed since July (despite applying for an uncountable number of jobs, both part-time and full-time) and living at home (which is not a great environment for me). 

I try doing stuff during the day, but everything just feels pointless and unfulfilling. I've always lowkey felt this, but the last year has made me really fear that I'll never truly be happy. I'm scared I'll always stay alive in the hope of finding happiness, but it'll never come, and I'll always be looking for something unobtainable.

I'm so lost."
depression,How do people even make time for themselves I always see stuff about takeing mental health days but dang I dont even have time for that it's always go go go and I'm so tired all the time I barely even stay sane most days I just trudge onto the next thing i got to do
depression,"I gave up the opportunity to make over $50,000 dollars off of all this Gamestop bullshit and I am more suicidal than I have ever been. I wasn't sleeping. I couldn't decide what to do. I was gambling with my lifesavings. It actually worked out. For once in my life, I didn't fuck up. I held and didn't sell until it returned to my original investment. Now I see all of these people who made money the first go round now making even more. WHY DID IT HAVE TO GO BACK UP. I feel like the biggest idiot loser on planet Earth right now and I don't know what to do. I will never live this down and I honestly want to end it. I am so worthless."
depression,"I Should Have Been Aborted It wouldn't make a difference if I was there or not. I don't see any value if I was born. Who knows, maybe my mother wouldn't have her schizophrenia and everyone would have a happier life."
depression,"anhedonia. How do I make myself feel pleasure like I use to?  

How do i force myself to feel enjoyment? Over the years I have lost interest in hobbies I used to love. I don’t feel much pleasure from video games, reading, anime, movies and tv shows anymore, I feel pretty much nothing. I read 7 books this year and I thought they were ALL boring. It was books that I know I would've loved in the past but I just felt very little. Video games that I used to love, I now find boring. Everything is  just boring.

I tried new hobbies like knitting, exercise and going for walks but that didn't help.

I don't want to feel this way but I can't control it. I want to feel pleasure so badly! I even tried drinking wine to feel something but I had to stop that. 

Whenever I am engaging in something I would rather be doing something else but there is nothing. I have nothing to look forward to. I play The Sims 4 or watch tv often but the enjoyment I feel is **extremely mild**. It just passes the time, nothing grabs me anymore. I feel grey... 

I can’t take it anymore. I’ve tried multiple medications and they don’t work. I hardly feel anything. I can’t experience normal amounts of pleasure anymore. It's so mild, sometimes nonexistent.

I'm in a DBT program for Borderline and it's not helping with the anhedonia at all. 

It's making me scared that it's permanent. I've struggled with depression for 13 years now. Even though I was depressed, I still enjoyed my hobbies like video games, It was my escape. Over the past five years however anhedonia has been slowly taking away the things I used to enjoy and now it's gotten to a point where I don't have an escape anymore. Since I have nothing to distract me, my depression is the WORST it's ever been. *I've also been experiencing cognitive decline, like word find issues, remembering what I'm talking about, etc.*

Have any of you gone through the same thing and FIXED it? Please, tell me how. I need help.

Thank you."
depression,"Im 13, And already know that my Childhood will be dark and empty. I dont have depression, But I have social anxiety, which is just as damadging. I dont have any friends. (which i dont really want tbh). Three words that kill me are ""Pick A Partner"". Whenever im in any social situation, i get sweaty, hot, and all these little pains in my back. I look around. Kids are having fun, riding bikes together, playing sports. Me, What am i doing? Nothing. Im just sitting in my bed playing video games all day. I have no plan for my future. Once my parents die, ill have nothing left. No famly, No wife. Ill just be by myself, in this cold dark extroverted world."
depression,"Becoming depressed with all the depression around me. Long story short: Me (28F), born out of a narcissistic mother and a father with alcohol problems (sometimes violent). Younger sister, whom I love deeply and tried to protect all my life, is now a depressive 20F, with episodes of self-harm. Recently moved to a new country, hoping to start a new life. Stated out nicely for the first couple of months. Partner, 31M, loving man with unmedicated ADHD, deep into a depression due to loss of 3 consecutive jobs. I manage to keep myself sane and strong most days, but others, I just want to cry my eyeballs out. I have been the good girl all my life, straight A student, responsible professional, good enough daughter, sister, friend, partner. How the f\*ck is my life so fucked up? I try to keep happy and strong, for me and, mostly, for the people I love. But I am so freaking exhausted of doing everything right and being what everyone needs me to be and yet feeling unhappy because everyone around me is unhappy. Sorry, I just needed to vent. Most times I just keep it for myself, I tell myself, life is hard for everyone and there is no point crying over the downs of life. But here I am, shedding my couple of weekly tears, alone, in front of the laptop. Happy Monday! :)"
depression,"I don't think he loves me. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I just don't know what to do anymore.

I don't think my boyfriend loves me anymore. I'm honestly not sure he's ever loved me. 

He goes through little spurts of showering me with passion and then it's like I don't even exist. 

He's asked me to marry him twice, and then taken it back twice. 

He got an inheritance and told me we were going to buy a house with it and so I looked up houses and when I show him he says he doesn't want to buy a house with me. I stress him out too much and he doesn't want to look at permanent things right now.

Our anniversary was 3 weeks ago and I asked him to take the day off work with me so we could celebrate. He played world of warcraft for 3 hours. I begged him to go out and do something... so we went for a walk to go buy new insurance for the car. I asked if we could go somewhere. He said he wasn't feeling it. Said he just kinda wanted the day off. He got mad at me when I cried. We had a HUGE fight. 

Our last anniversary wasn't much better. He got off of work two hours before me and by the time I got home he was too drunk to have dinner with me. 

Everything is always my fault. We had another fight again last night. He doesn't want me around. He doesn't think I add any value to our lives and that I'm just suffocating him. I stress him out and he doesn't want it anymore.

We have sex maybe once a month now. He gets literally angry with me when I ask to make love. He says he finds me very unattractive. That literally everything I do is a turn off for him.

I love him. I really do. I love him with everything but it is just so obvious that he does not love me back. 

I feel like I'm desperate. I feel like I'm trying to force a relationship with a person who doesn't love me. Why wont he just leave me? 

I feel like I can't stop living in a fantasy bubble. Like I'm building up a fake life for us in my head or something and I can't accept that that's never going to be reality. I'm addicted to the ""maybe someday our life will be happy"" but I also just know it's never going to happen.

But what am I supposed to do at this point? Just start my life over?"

depression,"I’m struggling really bad. I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember. I don’t really have a family or close friends to turn to so I always just try to deal with everything alone. But it’s getting too hard with all the new changes in my life. I was fired from my job due to lack of absence, since I’m so depressed it’s hard to motivate yourself for work everyday. The next day my cheap beater car that I just bought after being careless for months crashed. I slid off the highway and hit a pole and injured my leg where I couldn’t walk on it for a month. I thought the pole was going to kill me and I wonder why I lived. That same week my girlfriend and I finally broke up from a 4 year relationship. So with my lack of motivation and depression these things were really an extra slap in the face. Now I can’t find work, I’m struggling to get a vehicle, and I just want to die honestly. I’m sorry if this is just a pity party but i need help and have no idea who to turn to."
depression,"My friend died I had this online friend (relationshipish) for 8 months. He almost died back in November from a OD but lucky his family got to him in time. 

He is 25 I’m 19

He came back from rehab in January and we’ve been talking everyday sines then. Last time I’ve heard from him was Thursday  4th 12:50am. 

He texted me something incoherent. He told me he was buying drugs again and wouldn’t listen to anything I said. He said he would be careful so he wouldn’t cause me to worry again. We would meet one day and be together.

I googled his name and his obituary popped up he died March 4th. He didn’t get to get a second chance. He said he loved me the day before. He was only 25.


I can’t do this. I suffer withself harm, suicidal thoughts and depression. I can’t feel anything. I feel like I’m not crying enough my chest hurts. He was my only friend and he died. I can’t wake up to his texts anymore. I’ve deleted the apps we talked on it causes me pain to see them.


I don’t know if he killed himself or accidentally OD. This is making the pain much worse I felt like I couldn’t have done something I’m blaming myself I should have said something.

I want to die so bad it hurts, it hurts so bad I can’t focus on doing college homework, I have to work today hopefully that Leo’s my mind off. I don’t who to talk to my family wouldn’t understand bc I never told them about him."
depression,I feel really fucking crappy when will I get the courage to kill myself
depression,"I was depressed and decompensating and didn't even realize it...? Over my 20s my career bloomed but social life vanished. Finally at 32, found myself alone all the time, and with COVID no real prospects of going out and doing much. Anymore. Had been trying. An alcoholic... can't stop if I start. That won't ever change.

I've never been a major cryer, not suicidal, always made it to work. Because I *have to*. The prospect of losing my job, the only tether I have anymore, is more frightening than anything. 

My personality has always been... dark. Sarcastic. Brooding. Use those three words and my friends\* will instantly think of me. (I use an asterisk because I've realized, and I know it's cliche, who my true friends are through all this.) 

Slowly the things I used to enjoy stopped being fun. Don't even enjoy talking to other people unless I'm smashed. Figured I was just growing up... drifting apart... no. I'm bloody depressed. The undone chores, lack of cleaning, letting things go, restlessness, drinking even though I know it's bad. 

It got to the point where I have been smoking pot every night to have fun. I couldn't even enjoy an evening alone. Kept thinking *why do people get excited over things? Why do people care about mundane things when we're all going to die?* *Who cares what moves/shows are out? Why would you learn Japanese? Or learn an instrument, for what? Who would take the time to email their favorite podcast? Sober? Don't people realize looks fade? I can't believe I see the world in a way other people can't.*

So me and my high IQ just figured I was too smart/good for this world and shut myself out completely. Reality check: I'm depressed. And have been. So long I didn't realize it wasn't normal.

I am depression."
depression,"Anti-depressants like Trintellix (vortioxetine) Hi all. 
I’ve been on a Trintellix 10mg regimen for the last 5 months and recently I feel like my Trintellix is not as effective as it was when I first started taking it. I really like Trintellix because it wakes me up in the morning and doesn’t make me feel shaky. Have you folks had any experience taking Trintellix with another antidepressant? 
Thanks!"
depression,"I just want someone to hold me For the past 3 days I've been nearly unable to get out of my bed because of crippling anxiety, depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts. I just want physical and emotional contact with someone. I really want someone to hold me, cuddle me, kiss me, embrace me, love me and just do everything with.

For some reason it feels like none of this will never happen. Especially because of what i am, ugh, being trans is like playing life on ultra hard mode.

It feels like there's a 50/50 chance I'll either live or die.

I don't want to have to die. I'd much rather live happy but it seems like it's light years away. Im always happy in my dreams but when i wake up its like ""oh... Im back...""

I wish things would just get better, i wish i could stop crying all the time. The thoughts, anxiety and depression were so bad in fact that a few days ago i broke down in the forest alone, at night, on the ground, shaking, just not caring if any wild animals were to attack me.

I'd give anything to be happy and for someone to love me. I don't wanna have to die. I know i should be happy but im more lonely than anything.

It feels like im screaming into the void. I feel lost, cold and just in the pitch dark, unable to see any light...

depression,"Dad just wants to quit on life and I don’t know how to help. Out of all of my siblings I’m the only one living at home with my folks. I’m 32 and had my bout with depression and anxiety. I’m finally me free and have been panic attack free for close to a year now. 

I know that either one of my illness may come back with out warning but now I know the signs and what works and what doesn’t for me, so should that be the case I’m prepared to give it my best shot. 

But now I’m not here to talk about me, for I am relatively well (now focusing on working on my self esteem and health). I’m here to talk about my father, who recently had a major career setback and at his age is worried he’ll never get back to where he was. 

He’s got a new job, several steps back from his old position but he’s hanging in there thankful that both in a pandemic and at his age he’s got a job. 

Thing is a lot of things aren’t going exactly his way and he’s been diagnosed with depression. He’s taking a bit of diazepam and Paxil to manage but he hasn’t gotten all that better. 

He’s stated before to some of my other siblings and my mom that he just wants to go live alone away from it all. But then last week he told my mom he feels like just wants to die. 

He’s a heart disease survivor and depression and anxiety have been giving him cardiac like symptoms. He’s ok heart wise but his doctor says if he keeps this up he may just end up giving himself another heart attack. 

Mom says he’s worried about work, about how none of his kids are married or have life quite figured out, how he’s worried about my weight and how I
Might be headed to a heart attack myself. About lots of things he just shouldn’t be worried about. 

On my end I know I can do better for myself but I always fail with diets, I got to a nutritionist last week and began a new diet. Still I have a dad who worries and a mother who audits every single item on the fridge or pantry to see if I’m overeating. 

I’m working on myself to fix myself but how can I help my dad? I don’t want him to go just yet. I want him to be there for many things that are still to come to my life. 

I’m also sad my own issues have been contributing to his disease. How can I help from that angle as well?

He doesn’t want to tell me most things because he fears my own depression might return. I have told him that wouldn’t be the case and that now I’m
Equipped to deal with that. 

Any and all advise is greatly appreciated"
depression,"My girlfriend has been severely depressed - how can I help her? I’m [28M] currently dating my girlfriend [F24] of a little over 2 years and outside of a few rough patches, we’ve been doing okay. I know that arguing and disagreements are normal in a relationship, and it’s healthy to have disagreements where we can be honest with each other every now and then. We moved in together about a year ago when COVID started and have enjoyed each other’s company while being together. I work from home, so I get really excited when she comes through the door. We’ve worked together with our depression, especially when times get tough. She’s even encouraged me to seek mental health treatment and I love her for her genuine companionship. She means a lot to me and I feel like she feels the same way about me.

However, this last depressive episode has really had me beat. She recently left one retail job (toxic atmosphere for her) for another and it turns out the company she went for is an even bigger dumpster fire. It’s totally sacked her motivation and she’s been completely resistant to everything I try to do.

When I try to bring it up, it’s like she’s hesitant to bring it up, even though we promised to be more open with each other. I’ve had my own management changes at work and midterms in school, so I’m going through a stressful time as well. I try to be open about my stress and have encourage her to do to do the same, but this time, every tactic of mine has been counterproductive. I know I’m not perfect and I like that she helps me in times of stress, but she hasn’t reacted at all to anything I try to do to alleviate her struggle.

We complain together about work, and it only makes her more stressed. I’ve tried giving flowers, small plushes that she loves, and all she’s been doing is being nit picky about the chores I sometimes forget to do or some minor annoyance I have about something. I even try to go on small trips to get outside the house more instead of the studying I have to do. We even tried cooking and eating out together where I get the food/groceries so it’s not too hard on her wallet and it’s time we can share together. It’s only made me more anxious and it’s hard to be intimate with her when it doesn’t seem like she’s wants anything to do with the sights and sounds around her. When I told her she should go see a psychiatrist, she’s brushed it off nonchalantly in a “I might, thanks” kind of way. It’s honestly killing me inside and it causes my depression to skyrocket when nothing I do is ever enough, yet everything small detail I do makes her crabby.

Deep down, I know the girl I love is down there and she’s just going through a medical depression. But I have no clue how to help her. She won’t even help herself sometimes. I even got her a laptop so she can have her own workspace while applying to other jobs. When she gets home, sometimes all we do is get high and zone out. It’s driving me nuts and making me so anxious it hurts inside. It makes me feel like such a wuss. This morning, when I asked her if she’s okay, she finally told me she was feeling crabby and it just made me break down and cry. I just feel so alone and exhausted and that I’ll never amount to anything. And I’m at a loss as to what I can do to help her, but is there any else I can do that might make her feel more comfortable?"
depression,"Lowest I've ever been I don't know what to do anymore. I want to end my life but I can't do that to my family. So, I'm forced to live miserably and be apart of this fucked up society. I want to run and wither away on my own somewhere deep in a lonely forest where I belong. I don't fit in here, I never have. I keep pretending that I do in hopes that something will change and I'll feel even an ounce of joy, but who am I kidding..? I've always been the outcast of every situation and event I've been apart of - school, sports, home, work, etc. I don't know how everyone does it. I have no hope for my future and I hope that by some miracle my family turns on me so I can kill myself without a second thought. 

Until then I'll continue to suffer or at least wait until I feel absolutely nothing and decide to do it anyway despite others feelings.

depression,"Physical signs of depression People tend to focus on the mental, emotional, and behavioral effects of depression, but for me, physical signs have been a major indication that my mental health is worsening. If anyone is looking for patterns to gauge their own or others' current mental state, knowing these signs might help you.

Because of lack or excess of sleep, poor self care, changes in lifestyle, et cetera, I have developed prominent eye bags and dark circles, persistent acne (which I had never struggled with to this degree), fatigue, 24/7 headaches, and other possibly related symptoms such as nausea, indigestion, and 6 or more months without a period. These have served as indicators to me that my mental health is in fact worsening and not just a product of poor memory. However, this might also help you identify potential depression in the people in your life. We all know how hard it is to deal with, and missing these signs in others when we could be helping is hard on a lot of us. Just thought this might be helpful."

depression,"I don't know where my life is headed I'm almost 21 and I haven't even begun to tackle the problems of adult life, instead I chose to run away and hide in my room and have been doing so for almost 2 years now. The problems like not having any skills or job experience at 21 are coming back to bite me in the ass. My mental health is in shambles, so I don't know how I'm ever gonna get out of this cycle, it's not like I haven't tried.  


I have no goal. There's nothing I want to achieve that would make me get out of bed every day and work for it. I live on impulses: cook some food I have a craving for, read a book I want to read all of a sudden, play a game that catches my interest. I have no consistency in my life, the only constant is that I always end up in my room alone.  


All the things that I'm supposed to do like getting a career and a family don't appeal to me. I don't really want to spend 8-10 hours every day on doing something I don't care about and there's very little or practically nothing that I care about that I can turn into a job; and a family is more trouble than it's worth, I'd rather be alone.  


I understand that I'm wasting the best years of my life to bury myself even deeper into depression, but I just don't see what I need to be doing or even what there is to do to change my situation. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. The worst part is that I never asked for any of this. All these problems are not mine.

I haven’t done one single productive thing the whole week which just made me hate me even more, I probably could have done something if I tried but I didn’t even try.

I saw them after almost a year on that day and now I miss them so fuckin much. Here in my home town I have no friends that I can talk to or spend time with. I feel like crying sometimes. To fill the void I browse reddit and youtube and waste a lot my time playing online chess. I was just doing that today and then I lost some fuckin 10 games

I don’t have a purpose in my life. I don’t know what I want in life. Sometimes I lose interest in studies and I just don’t know what to do or how to feel about it. 

To all of you here, I have a question: how do you find happiness in life? I just cant fuckin find it anywhere. I am so alone. 

I just needed to put it somewhere. sorry"
depression,Today is the day In the past I've made plans and they've all fell through. Today will be different. I've got the rope and the determination. I've got nothing else here.
depression,"My take on the deadly disease Depression is a silent killer that takes a lot of lifes more than corona ever will.

So what is depression exactly?
Depression is a feeling of unhappiness, loneliness, misery. It’s a mental illness. You are either born with it  or you develop it due to a thing called “LIFE”.

It happens to all of us. I don’t thing anyone’s getting out of it unscathed, But we don’t want to talk about it. 
I think mental health needs to be addressed and be spoken about openly. You don’t know what someone is going through and they just need some talking to.

The late great Sushant Singh Rajput took his own life last year. The Killer was Depression. But Did he have to?
He had everything a man could want. Money, Power, Women, Wealth and Fame and yet something was missing. There was a void in his life and it had to be filled. 

It doesn’t make sense as to why a grown intelligent successful man like he would take his own life. 
It’s because of the demons and devils that battle in one’s own head on a daily basis. It’s unexplainable and they have to come out and speak out there’s no weakness or shame in addressing a problem.

HOW TO CURE IT?

There is no remedy for depression. It’s a lifelong battle you must endure. No amount of medication or therapy can completely cure depression.
Taking your mind out of that feeling is possible.

You can exercise, dance, draw and create something to fill that void. Exercise as per studies have shown to release hormones like endorphins and dopamine which aid in feeling good, and when you’re depressed feeling good is not a bad thing.

Tyson Fury the Heavyweight world Champion succumbed to depression.  
This is his before and after. He’s mentioned in countless interviews that he didn’t want to live and tried to take his life on multiple occasions but failed.

Exercise was the primary reason why he got back from the dump stopped drinking, binge eating and doing drugs to regain the heavyweight championship of the world.
LETS GET RID OF THE TAG AND STIGMA

Lets speak about it in open there’s no shame in being depressed. If it can take the heavyweight champion of the world down it can take anyone down. 

There’s many helplines and medical centres which can help those suffering from it. 
Being depressed is ok but not addressing it and taking your own life is not. You’re not helping anybody you’re just passing on the pain.

Lets do it together and beat depression."
depression,tell me a story someone?? im lonely and cramping :c
depression,"Money would cure my depression... Now I have realized all my depression is legit related to being a broke ass. I am tired of not being able to do anything because I literally have no money not even a penny. I am tired of everything costing money! I am powerless and dependent on my parents. I am always getting rejected from jobs. I am always making excuses to make myself feel better like I am 17 so it’s ok to not get a job now. Gonna wait till 18. Then I see people who worked even at 13. It’s getting so tiring, can’t even buy necessities for myself without asking parents for money. It just draining so much shame and guilt from me. Wish I could just print some money out. Or some rich ass people just adopt me for whatever I can do for them. And then boom I am the happiest person in the world Lmaooo. If I had money I would kiss my tears and sadness goodbye forever. I don’t see any reason why money wouldn’t make one happy."
depression,"When you feel like a complete societal outcast When you go outside for the first time in days, after a depressed state and everyone seems to be living in ignorant bliss, while your heaving on the inside living with crippling depression that nobody is none the wiser of and assumes your a healthy functional person like them, that is such a lonely feeling. You don't know those peoples lives who seem healthy and functional, people in a chirpy tone talking to the older builder or people in vans clearing up after a days work, or people going around in corporate looking cars well dressed or whatever it might be, your convinced they cant be plagued with dark defeating thoughts like you. They come and go, drive, talk, have interesting things to say, are chatty etc...and I just think WHY? why bother? Is that hot exhausting? It takes effort for me to shower. I feel so ashamed, only my therapist knows, how difficult my life is. Even the pharmacist where I get medication asks if I'm available on a day to pick up medication and I felt like replying if my depression isnt crippling that day I should be able to, but she assumes I work so I said I'll have to check. Why does everyone assume your this functional person when your not? Why cant it be ok to say I actually struggling to even deal with interacting people for years, the meds dont work, I feel so low and am trying to overcome this. No instead I've to pretend that I'm a functional normal person not to freak people out or cause them to panic. Oh how I wonder what it is like to be a healthy person, with friends, career and what not."
depression,"I'm not hungry anymore? It's been almost a month of hunger pains but no hunger. In fact, I feel almost nauseous most of the time. I force myself to eat just so I don't starve myself in front of my family. Does this usually happen or should I be even more worried?"
depression,"TW I think my mom noticed my cuts I'm ready for so much pressure to be put on me now, excessive efforts to help me *in the wrong way* while not actually listening to how I want to be helped. I just don't want to be here, I'm not ready for more pressure to be placed on me and being forced to do things she thinks will help without actually taking my opinion on it. I already have enough going on in my head."
depression,"What would you if these were your last moments? Let’s say last day, weeks, months 
What would do things if you know that at the end of these weeks/months you will end your life. What are you going to spend your time doing? I sure would like to have a crazy adventure. Would you join? What would this crazy adventure be?"
depression,Idk what to do what should I do I've been on my phone for HOURS because I just don't want to exist? Idk? Like I've just been switching apps and talking to strangers (I mean now I'm on Reddit) ughhhhhhhh I just feel so sick and I'm trying to escape but I can't
depression,"How does one go about seeking help? (18F) I have always dealt with depression, but these past 3 years have been the most difficult. My depressive episodes last a couple of months, and when they do..boy it's tough. I can't get up from bed. I can't be productive; my attention span is basically nonexistent. I also lose my appetite, so I always lose weight. After a while, I came to the conclusion that this is more than being ""sad"". I have everything: a roof to sleep under, pets, money, very encouraging friends, and a lovely family. If i have all of this...then why am I so tired of life? Of course, I've kept all of this a secret from my parents. I really want to seek professional help, because I want to get better. I'm also only 18 years old, my life is just about to get started and I'm already wanting to end it, it's very concerning and terrifying. How do I bring this up to my parents? I'm afraid that they'll think I'm lying or just going through a ""phase"". I'd like to stay alive for them, I don't want for them to feel guilty if I end my life."
depression,"I genuinely hate being an adult. Everything is complicated and difficult. Nothing is fun or interesting. Everything is just hard. 

I miss being a kid so much. I was never one of those kids who couldn’t wait to grow up. I’ve always known adulthood is a joke and honestly I didn’t think I would live past high school. Now I have no fucking direction or idea of what to do with my life. It feels like I’m just wasting time until I die."
depression,"I just want time off from existing No body, no mirrors, no responsibilities, no wanting or needing to do things, I just want to completely rest for a while. Ugh."
depression,"I feel like i don't have much time left with my BF My boyfriend is probably the best thing that ever happened to me. He's sweet, he's beautiful in every single way. He's supportive and is there for me when i need him.

But, last Spring i got some shitty things on my plate, got a tumor, needed surgery, my long-term project at work got killed, got a burnout, and fell into depression. I had to quit my job &amp; and basically lost all will to keep going. I'm currently taking a break from society. Getting through the days watching Netflix &amp; playing animal crossing. 

Currently I'm in the process of recovering. While I'm doing a lot better than some months ago. I still notice I'm  dragging my boyfriend down with me. He says I'm always welcome at his place. And i love sleeping with him, waking up next to him. But i know it's not doing him any good. 

He never wants to leave for work when i have a bad day, he tiptoes around me because he doesn't want to make me cry. And i can see him not doing well. Which is BECAUSE of me. He admitted, he's feeling gloomy because I'm dragging him down. And that it's hard to be happy, when he knows I'm not doing well.

I'm constantly conflicted feeling like he's putting too much pressure on me having to get better, but also feeling like I'm a bitcg for not giving him enough credit for always being there for me, and sticking around even though I'm very draining.

ANYWAYS, the point. He's been... More distant lately. He told me ""he feels like he's got a wrong image of me"" as I've been depressed for the majority of our relationship. He saud that ""he can't wait until im over it, so he can meet the real me"". While i agree and understand his wishes, the way he worded it HURT really bad. He also said to get myself checked more, search for better help ask if i can get medication, as my psychiatrist isn't helping rly.  I honestly feel like the things he said were out of proportion, and they hurt me a lot. I'm improving a lot, I'm working really hard, am taking steps in the direction of recovery. But still he only sees me at my worst... I'm afraid i won't get better / good enough before he's tired of me. I've expressed this worry, and he said ""ye...."" And kinda ended the conversation there. Which, for sure confirmed I've got a deadline. But i don't know when that would be..."
depression,"Not sure I've been debating if I should put an end to my life.

I've been in a lot of mental pain since Corona and debating if I should end my life but here is my dillema

If I decide to put an end to my life and die, will it be better than life, or will it even be worse then my life is right now?

Unfortunately there is no one to ask the answer to.

But this is my main reason that I'm hesitating.

I just wanted to write this down because it was stuck in my head since last night so yeah..."

depression,Need to vent So I am bipolar and am current in my depressive state. I am super stressed at work which makes it worse. I am a nurse and working super crazy hours and get calls non-stop everyday. I am supposed to be taking a 4 day weekend this week and my boss is threatening to take that away from me since we are so short. I go to work and can't stop crying and feel like I am useless to my daughter right now. My boyfriend is tired of hearing about it and I just don't know what to do.
depression,"My parents told me to just ""Forget depression"" Thank you so much. This is the best advice I ever had! Holy shit I never knew you could just forget it. This is mind blowing!"
depression,Where do u guys find friends I just want depressed friends so I can relate and not feel like a burden or weird when we joke about our depression together idk
depression,"Rant I don’t want to pretend to anybody, I don’t want to fake smile, make small talk. I just really hate being fake to people.It makes me so uncomfortable. I’m just irritated all the time and people just make me more irritated especially at work dealing with dumbass customers...idk what to do. Ive got some nice things. I moved to a diff environment...I’ve changed jobs, a job that pays me more then I ever had,finally got a car, got an adorable lovely dog. I have people around me. But I’m still not happy. No matter where I go I still have this shitty feeling. 90 percent of my days I’m just irritated, tense and on defense mode most of the time. Just going through the motions. Idk what to do... I feel bad for the people around , I can’t even try to pretend to act happy around them... my emotions are starting to seep out more and more by the day, and can’t seem to control them as much as I could before...idk just ranting to let this shit out. Maybe someone can relate at least"
depression,"my mum is always upset because of me i never realised i made my mum upset. It was only when my sister shouted at me which she has been for the past few months telling me how much i upset her and how horrible i am. i don’t mean to. and in all fairness my mum is mean to me too. She always tells me how much she’s been cleaning and working but i work every single day and clean constantly but she never realises. She just says that i never do anything or that she doesn’t ask for much. She complains that she has to work 3 days a week. I go to school where i have to work 5 days a week there or online and i have a ton of homework i have to do at the weekends and the days where i don’t have homework i’m at my dads house where i can’t go on my phone that much and i have to do my best to make him happy. 

But today she came to me and yet again complained about how much she’s been working and how much money she spends on me and my sister. 

this annoys me

she decided to be a parent, she wanted this and she knew what it would be like. 

i didn’t ask to be born and i didn’t want this.

she keeps on telling me how much she’s been crying because of me. this doesn’t make sense to me as i cry everyday due to a lot more reasons that she has. She doesn’t know that i get bullied by my friends or that i have over 100 pieces of work overdue (literally). 

yet when i cry i don’t tell her as i don’t want her to feel bad, why does she get to?"
depression,"What am I supposed to do if I am rotten both inside and out? I hate myself. I really hate myself. I don't mean that in a self loathing way. Lately, it's just been a fact. When I look inside myself, the deepest parts of myself. The person I hate the most is myself. I find myself repulsive. Disgusting. I hate every aspect about me.

What am I supposed to do if I am rotten both inside and out?  I know myself better than anyone. And I hate every inch of me. I hate that I have to be around myself 24/7. I hate myself. I hate myself deeply. I just want to disappear."
depression,"I just admitted myself to a mental hospital for the first time and I feel like a fraud... Over the last couple of months my mental health declined rapidly due to one bad thing happening after the next. It got so bad that I fell headfirst into the worst depression I ever had. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I had no energy to get up. I couldn't concentrate for more than 5min max.

Today I finally visited my therapist again after avoiding it for waaay too long. She got so worried for me after I told her everything that she called around for a mental hospital to take me in right now. I agreed since I knew that I was actually in such a bad place...

But after arriving here and telling the doctor what went wrong I feel like such a crybaby and a fraud. My problems sound so silly and small when I talk about them yet they destroyed me. I feel weak and I'm kinda waiting for the staff to just laugh at me and tell me to go home..."
depression,"I am a depressive fella, who thinks he won't be able to enjoy life ever and will ruin everything around him Well, the story starts ten years ago when I was 15 and I first realized religion is man-made and there is not any Eternal Caretaker in the sky up there and we are on our own. I denied this realization for three years until I became atheist/agnostic.

I was living in a small town at that time, did not had access to digital media and quality literature, so I thought I am the only person who is like this. I thought for so long that something is wrong with my brain, I am not able to think straight. I felt like I am the alien among humans, I tried to come to terms with the concept of God but the contradictions it holds boggled my mind.

I used to be a brilliant student, achieving significantly higher marks in school back then. Anything teachers talked about I used to have knowledge about those things and contribute to the teacher's discussion or lectures. I used to spend all my time reading books, newspapers, and magazines, or anything I could get my hand on.

Things took a turn when I shifted with my brother in the city, he mistreated me, emotionally abused me. I still feel the humiliation of his words. He never let me talk anywhere and ridiculed me in front of everyone including relatives/neighbors. He never appreciated anything about me, I used to achieve medals at school, he used to tell people that I bought it from the market. Overall, my family was insensitive to my achievements and did not realize the impact of words on a child. My brother sent me back to the village to my parent many times and there, somehow, my parents were made believe that I am the guilty party that I cannot live with my brother and they didn’t like anything I used to do or talk about they burnt my magazines and books many times that I would turn mad If I kept reading at that pace.

I started suppressing my feelings and shut my mouth and started spending more time alone in a room reading books. Before that, I tried seeking refuge in religion, I used to cry at night and ask God to make sense to me. Meanwhile, I was seeking God, a blind old man came into my life and helped me establish my belief in spirituality, he used to tell me what things I talked about at school and what things I did during my day. I shared every single secret of mine, my crush, my sexual experiences, and orientations (I used to have a thing for women twice of my age). Soon he became too controlling and started making strange desires, like tasting my sweat and kissing my mustaches or hug him with shirt-off to exchange the sweats. He bought me some expensive gifts and promised me a bright future. He had an experience of twenty-five years of teaching and thousands of followers as a spiritual guide. I was trying to make sense of things or justifying them one way or other until his only son became friends with me. He told me everything about him and that he is gay with strange tendencies and all the things he used to tell me were because of his spies/followers around me. I tried to end terms with him, but he tried to ruin my career by going to the exam and trying to cancel my exam through his acquittances and followers by alleging that I abused or blasphemed him. He turned people from all walks against me. I used to receive death threats from unknown numbers on daily basis.

I deviated from my studies, started taking an obsessive interest in women. All the time I used to think about sex and women. I was in a deep depression. Not a single person to whom I could trust or talk with. I was in my intermediate studies; I could not focus on studying. I used to open book and rote only the first few lines all day and could not get through a single page. While words were on my tongue. My mind was wandering and thinking about sex, God, all the things I went through, some philosophical thoughts like bases of morals, social norms until I denied everything. I was getting things all on my own. And the most dangerous thing of all was I stopped reading altogether under the pressure of passing my Intermediate exam and getting into the university.

Before I used to secure marks above 90-95%, I got scholarships at all levels of my educations. But in my intermediate studies, in the first year fell to 80% and then in the second year overall to 75%. I knew this was all because I could not study well. I still feel this as a big failure of my life.

By the way, I decided to make amends and decided to do Chartered Accountancy, one of the toughest degrees in Pakistan. I was able to hold onto things for a year and then I collapsed again. I realized I had too many compulsive behaviors, I fell into self-destructive thought patterns, started blaming my past and my family for all the things wrong with me, failed the next exam, then passed some papers and some failed. I finished off my studies which were compulsory to get to the next stage of getting into training in some corporate office and pass my next exams. Here I felt I do not have any confidence to get along with things and I was too shy. Ultimately got manipulated by seniors in learning things. They used to give me all manual/laborious work, somehow, I got changed, my group. Now I was with a good person, my lack of confidence and shyness started ruining everything. I could not help myself get better. At the office, I feel like the burden of the entire universe on my shoulders and while communicating my thought process stops and I cannot understand what is going in. I now impart expression of an awkward person, who is just a dumbass to get jokes or understand anything witty or any other thing at all. My performance is worst, and everything is going into ruins.

I tried too many times to get better, sometimes I feel compulsive and start too many things at a time. I make a routine by calculating every single second of my day. And suddenly, there are a million things I want to do and make plans for them, like programming, writing, getting in shape, improve dressing, and many other things not concerned to my field. Most of the time I feel shit and cannot do anything.

A year before joining the firm, I was inspired by Karl Marx’s ideas, joined a socialist organization worked for them, joined a theatre to learn acting and improve confidence. Everywhere I became a victim of politics and things instead of getting better worsened off.

Now everything I decide to do to make better myself/ feel better myself I do at the cost of other things. I must pass my final exams for that I have to let go of everything else. Started too many things in the way, cannot make my mind what to drop off.

Problems in nutshell.

Compulsive behaviors

Social anxiety 

Shyness

Lack of confidence

Worst communication skill

While doing the planned talk, I cannot utter a word.

There are so many things I want to get off my chest, this all might seem rambling and random thoughts. But the fact is I cannot feel good or happy. It seems I am ruining my life and most of the time. I am depressive and all out of control."
depression,"I woke up crying and now I can’t stop I’m extremely lonely. I think my boyfriend is uninterested in me. He went to work a few states away and was suppose to be back today, plans changed and idk when he’ll be back. 

Everything is just different, I don’t get compliments anymore. Unless I do it first, same with texting. 
Or I just get a simple reply. 

If we break up, I have no other reason to live. I love him too much. He was the highlight of everyday to come home to after working."
depression,"I feel alone. I need help. So I had a shitty year as a lot of people, I met what I consider the love of my life via Tinder, we spent four days together she traveled to meet me, and then she came back to her country.

Then the pandemic starts, I stop working, then my father hospitalized for the first time 30 days on ICU, we almost lost him two months later my grandmother died, first time I had to deal with death, after that my father went back to the hospital, then the girl I met asks me for time, and I forced her to broke up with me, she blocked me. I didnt get back to job and my contract ended.

Weeks before my birthday, my mom was hospitalized for first time, and on my birthday my ex contacts me, I still love her, so I decided to talk to her again, one month later we argued, after 2 months of non speaking I talked to her back and we agreed to see each other in her city. My uncle had covid and he was two weeks on icu too.


One year later I didnt got a job, I stay at home most of the time, I try to speak to my closest friends and there are days that nobody speaks to me because they are busy, and I told my ex how bad I feel and she doesnt respond to me. I dont see no way out of this."
depression,"Might just kill myself I’m just tired of living. The only satisfaction I feel is getting High as shit only to feel worse the next day. I’m still in high school but I’m fucking up all my classes even though I know the answers, I just don’t try to make an effort. I think I’m the problem, everything, everyone, I touch is inflicted with the same darkness I carry around. Everyone whose met me has never been better for it. This world would be better off without me."
depression,"The System Is Fucked I guess most people on here thought that, one way or another. When people ask me why I feel so depressed, I want to talk about corporate greed, about the destruction of our environment to save a few cents, about wages that do not suffice to start a family.

And day after day, we are told that we are the problem. We don’t try hard enough. Fuck that! I have a degree in law in one of the most prosperous countries in the world and even that is not enough to sustain a family right now. I see friends from university work a 9 to 9 to ‚advance‘ their careers. They exploit themselves just to make a few rich people even richer. 

We experience the last stage of a society that is ruled by greed and selfishness. That’s why I am depressed. 

**The system is fucked.**"
depression,"Desires for death but invicible hands holding me away from death I've been hospitalized for depression and suicidal thoughts for already 8 weeks and more days will come that i'll be here. 

Therapies, talks, care from nurses, doctors, psychiatrist, parents and friends are here for me, rooting i'll get cured from this 'depression'.

&amp;#x200B;

3-4 years ago, i had this thoughts, i had this images of my brother dying. Day by day, minutes by minutes. And i almost commited suicide.

Between those days, when those images were gone, i had a normal life. Laughing, caring for people, having fun with people. But all the hurdles and pains i felt between those days, i kept it inside me. And i realised now, that it was the biggest mistake i've ever made.

Since the thoughts about my brother, troubles in real life, stress at home and school, i've kept it inside me. Small or big troubles/sadness, i've kept it inside me.  Until the jar is full and it exploded. How hard i try, i can't put a mask on anymore. How hard i try to be positive, negativity became stronger. How hard i try not to think about the only solution i had in mind. DEATH. I keep thinking about dying.

I'm suffering mentally and I want to die. But i can't die because, it would be selfish by pushing away those people who are holding me.

I want to die.

But I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, if you're struggling with something or anything. Talk.  

Talk with us, talk with ur parents, talk with a proffesional, talk with someone on the internet.

Don't fill the jar like i did.

I'll keep fighting because i must, but u guys should keep fighting too."

depression,"The first person I fell in love with in 7 years is gone. I don't know where else to post this but I knew I'd get support here. Over the course of the last year, I've slowly fallen in love with a girl who has been my best friend the entire time. She always knew it to some degree I think, but we were such good friends I think she just tried to ignore it so it wouldn't get awkward. I've been so lonely for so long, and then she came along and she's unlike anyone I've ever met... She's perfect for me. Recently we got drunk and she saw how much pain I was in... and in a drunken state she put herself aside and cuddled/comforted me for the better part of an hour. A few days after she thought we could work... but I realized quickly she just cared about me so much that she made herself like me just to save me. I told her I thought this was the case... and she very sadly said I might be right. This led to a somber conversation where we decided to just be friends from now on because she doesn't want to hurt me. 


But I don't know how to move on. I can't eat, I can barely sleep. I can't find peace outside of drugs. I am alone, once again. The only thing I want in the world is something I can't have. I need help... bad."
depression,"Screaming I want to scream,idk what for i just have that urge, maybe cuz I've bottled up my problem and emotions for the past few years and they've been eating away at me,i can't take much more,i feel like if I don't let it out I'll break,but it doesn't suit an emotionless awful person like me to do that i guess"
depression,"Crippling Depression and Anxiety Ordeal Two weeks ago, I got hit with a sudden and severe episode of derealization that morphed into severe depression and anxiety. I have not been on my regular medication in some time, and I don't know if this is an extreme withdrawal. 

For some context: I am on the spectrum and usually take Lexapro and Adderall. 

It has been two weeks with extreme mood swings from depression to relative normality. My anxiety is off-the-charts and has utterly crippled my daily life. I find myself constantly ruminating about my past decisions and my life (I've been in college too long). But the thought that brings me deep sadness is that I don't really have a deep, personal bond with anyone outside my family. My family is supportive but I don't have anyone to talk to about my emotions, feelings, and insecurities. The ruminating is exhausting, and every day it's something different: either I'm lamenting my life choices, fixating on random memories/missed opportunities, feeling depressed over my lack of deep human connections. Usually, I have a passing thought about this and I chalked it up to the pandemic, but now it's way too extreme. The anxiety has also taken its toll and I can't tolerate being in a room with a bunch of people for too long.

I don't know what caused this. Am I having a quarter-life crisis? Am I going through withdrawal? Is the social isolation getting to me? I have stopped reading books and listening to music. I keep ruminating and it's exhausting me. What worries me the most is the notion that my loneliness and depression are how I've felt all along, and my medication was just suppressing these feelings, making me go on autopilot the last several years of my life. And now that I haven't taken my medication in some time, are my real emotions coming out stronger and fresher? Every now and then, I'd stop and think about past decisions, like everyone else, but now it's cranked up to 11. 

One seemingly innocuous piece of context: before my depression, I watched Evangelion in its entirety and realized that its themes of loneliness, depression, and human connection applied to me. I don't know if that contributed to my sudden depression. This was maybe two weeks before the onset of my depression. 

If anyone has any advice or coping tips, please post them.

tl;dr: I've been suffering from depression, extreme anxiety, and intense rumination for the past two weeks and don't know what caused it or how to deal with it."
depression,"Where do I begin to start caring? Hi, I'm 19, I live in Europe in a decently wealthy country.
I don't have an education, I don't have a partner, I don't see people in real life, I have one close online friend.
I have absolutely no care for my future or for my health, I don't want to get a job or to make a family, I don't want to travel, I don't want to meet new people.

I eat unhealthy and I do zero physical activity, my skin hasn't seen sunlight in years.

Having no future doesn't scare me, infact, nothing does, but nothing entices me either; I spend my days playing videogames, watching youtube, eating of sleeping.

My question for functioning members of society is:

How do I start caring like you do?

How do I go to bed at night excited for tomorrow and wake up in the morning ready to take life head on?

What does it feel like to be happy?
What does it feel like to feel anything?
Do you feel happy all day?
Is happiness what drives you to live?
Do you wake up in the morning motivated to do your duties?

How do I give a shit about anything when everything is dreadful and bland and nothing makes me feel anything?

How do I give a shit about my health if I don't even feel alive?

Why should I care about anything, and why should I not hang myself if every second of my existence is nothing but pure dread and suffering?"
depression,"Do bad people have better lives? The guy I used to date cheated on his gf (that I didn't even know existed) and I confronted him and we broke up. Now he's back with the girl he cheated on ??? She literally was the one to warn me about him but now they be together again? 

I'm so confused. Do people like that end up happy? It nearly killed me to know I was cheated on and I'm suffering feeling like an idiot that I completely trusted them so blindly. There was a point I wanted to take revenge on him but I decided to not but now he's just happy living his best life out there while I regret every day for making bad decisions smh

I hope time heals me a little faster. I'm sick of being depressed and feeling bad for a mistake"
depression,i wanna turn off my phone i wanna turn off my phone for a couple of days to see who actually cares about me but i’m kinda scared because what if no one does.. should i do it anyway?
depression,"No one person I can tell all my problems to It seems as though all my childhood shyness and inability to make friends is coming back to haunt me. Coupled with my speeding up descent into depression, I don’t have once person I can talk to about my problems. Sure I can tell my mother stuff, but I don’t like worrying her. And if I have something more personal to say, then I feel awkward telling her. I talk to strangers on the internet about more private stuff, but they are strangers. They are just words types on a messaging app, whether it be Reddit, Kik or somewhere else. I feel like they don’t want to listen to me. They just hear what I say, give a generic response back and make a note not to talk about that subject again. I never meet them irl, since they are from all over, so I have no idea how they really feel about me. Have one friend from high school, who I can tell some stuff to, but I am in no way comfortable sharing intimate details about my life with her, we aren’t those kinds of friends. I’ve tried a therapist, but she just prescribed anxiety meds that had no affect. I don’t want to take my own life, but living like this sucks. Only I truly know how dark it is in my head. And while everyone is like that, I wish there was someone willing to help lighten the load more than others already have."

depression,"Is it normal to have completely internalized the idea of wishing you'd never been born? I definitely have my fair share of issues, but I'm not depressed. Or am I?  
  
Something that I have come to realize is that it doesn't matter whether I feel like shit or not: I always carry with me the thought that it's better to never have been born. It's just how it is, at least to me. The cons outweigh the pros. Life isn't a fairy tale. I'd call it a tragedy, but stories usually have a point to them, and life doesn't even have that.  
  
I have episodes of intense self-hatred, of panic and anxiety. These are what you'd call ""issues"", I suppose. But this apathy - perhaps even hatred? - towards life seems to have slowly and subtly wormed its way into my mind in a way that makes me unable to disassociate it from my ""normal"" way of thinking. Though I do need to emphasize that I personally consider this to be a completely rational and sensible idea. Life *does* inherently suck, even though the degrees vary (mine would suck a fair damn bit).  
  
Is this worrisome? Or am I overthinking it? Has this put me on the long road of coming to regard suicide as a viable solution to my issues with life, perhaps in the long term, say when my parents pass away and my default mental state becomes indiscernible from my depressive episodes?  Am I voicing an idea we all have, but others choose to relativize/compartmentalize?   

I genuinely can't tell. Can one of you?"
depression,Cutting Im cutting again and i hate myself for it.
depression,"I’m living for the little things Like, the really little. The taste of tea, the list of videos I haven’t watched, incomplete work; everything else just sort of fades into meaninglessness. I don’t have the energy to hope for anything bigger right now, I’m convinced at the moment that I can’t have a happy ending. I’m hoping that the severity of my low is temporary, but I have no idea what I’ll do if I do get out. Everything just seems dead-end and hopeless. 
I hope everyone else is doing okay. I can’t help but have such strong feelings for people I know are going through similar struggles. I hope you all know how wonderful you are."
depression,"I'm forcing myself to fail. I haven't done any work in over a month, despite collecting the paychecks.

I sit at the computer, but can't bring myself to do anything, despite screaming at myself internally to stop wasting time and get it done.

I feel like I'm collapsing in on myself and I'm a worthless pile up of shit, and I'm self-sabotaging because I don't feel like I deserve the past praise I've gotten and I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop and something negative to happen to me.

I'm trying to break out of this mindset, but it's just so hard and even beating myself up over it just seems to make it worse.

I shouldn't feel like I deserve to fail. I have an excellent record and have done good work, but despite all that I can't help but feel hopeless."
depression,"Reminder of why I keep trying A rant for myself


Basically I got too comfortable, I trust people too much more than I know I should and now all I feel is pain. Everyday I tried to do a little more but Ive stopped for half a week and all I feel is pain and lonliness, of all the people I have met and all the people I have ever tried to connect with only two people consistently show any interest in me outside of obligation. I know some people would be happy with one person but for some reason I can't help but want more. I hate myself for being so greedy but I just want to reach out to more people and be a source of happiness as cheesy as it sounds, but instead I always end up the third choice I always have to be the on to try and start conversations, I used to have more people in my life but after I stopped starting every conversation everyone slowly dissappeared. I got too attached to someone and they haven't spoken to me in a week and I have no real idea why. I always try but i just end up in the same situation filled with pain. Sometimes I wish I could just sleep at night without having to distract myself from the world and I could just fall asleep happy that somebody loves me but im too greedy and too filled with pain to be able to. I hate myself for ever caring this much

depression,"I want to die I genuinely don’t know what to do, I stay in my room all day just talking to people online hoping it will get better but it doesn’t. My birthday is near and I really hope it’s my last."
depression,"There are parts of me that will never ever agree I live in a constant internal conflict. It's like there are parts of me that want things that other parts hate the most. A part of me wants children but I would rather die than have one. A part of me wants to sell everything and travel and be free, another part would be terrified of this, it just needs to be in a safe place at all times. It's like there is this evil game that parts of me are playing where one wants something the other cannot stand. No, please don't tell me that everyone is like this because I will shoot myself if I hear that once again. No, everyone is not like this, otherwise everyone would be very depressed and suicidal. I just want to kill parts of myself. Or just end it somehow."

depression,Tired of it I'm so tired of feeling this way everyday I don't see a end in site I'm tired lonely feel like No one understands me. I've been trying to be happy but it doesn't help crying everyday feeling a pain in my chest like I'm being crushed. I've done things to hurt the people closest to me and I just don't want to hurt anyone anymore. Everyone says it'll be fine or everything's going to be okay but how is it going to be when I know how I've hurt people. It's hard to write this and I've never done it before and I hope this will help me. I do ask you how do you cope with the sadness and anger? It's like a switch in my brain goes off and I do and say stuff without a care then at nite I just cry for what I've said and done I've broken thing cursed people for no reason. I would be lying if I didn't think about doing myself in. I do understand that's a horrible idea and all it would do is hurt the people I love the most.
depression,"There's no Escape I'm 25 year old guy who has achieved nothing in life. No job experience, no skills, literal nothing. Barely any contact with people. Living with family which is basically reason I can even exist and even they feel to me like strangers. Dropped out of college twice. Last 5+ years completely killed any passion and motivation and social skills. Can't talk to people after years of isolation. Don't even know what words to use or what to ask anyway. Feel suffocated to do anything besides being in room all day, staring at screen, sleeping and doing nothing. Mind goes blank a lot and when it isn't, it's all overthinking and pain. That's now daily thing. Before just wasted all time on games, movies and music &amp; now that's kinda my personality. I'm basically library of useless information which I can't share with anyone. Not even good at writing and making opinions, and it's not like I care much about my own opinion either. Just seeing darkness around and am too self and world aware which makes all things hurt soo much more. Constant sadness, no excitement and not much common with others. Can't see anything good in future. Can't even see how someone could help and reach out to me anyways with my 100 barriers blocking them. My life seems over and even besides my life so many people seem unhappy which is painful to witness when knowing how kind hearts they are. If there's abyss for a mind, I'm almost at the deepest point."
depression,"Are best friends just for kids? One of the only things I was proud of was the fact that I was an amazing friend. Honestly. But then I had to learn to never expect the same from others. Not in terms of love and not in terms of effort. And now I wonder if that's even a thing for adults. Is it normal to be so lonely as an adult, as I cannot truly talk to anyone anymore even as I have friends, or am I just so unlovable that people don't think I'm worth the effort even tho I am kind? And people do in fact have great friends with whom they talk about the bad stuff and on whom they can rely, but it is not meant for me.

I am so, so damn lonely. I'm starved for friendship and for love yet I can't even imagine a boyfriend being willing to actually listen to my problems and help me, so the most I can daydream about is just having someone to hug and cuddle in silence. I don't even care for sex, in fact if it could be avoided that would be for the best. It is not that I'm asexual, it is that I hate my body and can't imagine people being attracted to it.

Thing is that I can, I absolutely can, physically, be on my own. I will be moving forward in life. And it is terrifying to me that I will be miserable and alone the whole time. Wondering if people can tell the loneliness is not a choice. If they think I deserve it, that I'm pathetic for it. If they don't even consider that I'm lonely and in fact only see these horrible things I can't identify that make people not love me, not respect me. And I can't identify them, if I knew what made me so awful, I'd change. And I already changed so much. What else is there? How awful am I?"
depression,"I’m in legit physical pain from my depression. You know the phrase “broken heart”. Everybody does. I feel like I can actually feel my heart breaking. I’m in immense physical and emotional pain right now. I am worthless, cast aside by those I loved deeply. I feel tortured by even good memories. Nostalgia is extremely painful for me. My heart feels like what pulled pork looks like. 
I just want to sleep and never wake up. I wish the everyone would let me go so I can truly take my own life in peace."

I was anxious a lot because of OCD and had my bad moments, but at least I had that spark inside.
Now it's fading, I simply have a hard time feeling happy or excited about shit.
I'm getting number by the day, and there are no plans, no dreams, no nothing. I'm shutting down, maybe it's the meds or my mind just can't take the anxiety and fear anymore.

Not sure how long this can go on."
depression,"I don't think I'm capable of love I'm lucky enough to have a support system. I know on paper that my friends and family love me but I don't understand it. I've had several people I'm close with die in the past year and I'm not sad. I cried with my family when it was appropriate but I don't think I felt much.
 I've basically lost contact with two former best friends in the past year and I don't care that much. If they texted me I wouldn't ghost them but I don't miss them, ever. 
I've never had feelings or even a crush on anyone. I want to have a significant other so someone loves me and I'd like to love them back but I don't know if I can. I've had the option to go out with people before but I just felt nothing. 
I'm the ""therapist friend"" of my friend group so I know people trust me and rely on me but I can't bring myself to rely on them back. I do want things to go well for them but if we stopped talking to each other overnight that would be fine too. 

Is love really this underwhelming ? I enjoy spending time with my friends and family but if I lose them I don't care that much. Is this really it? 

I don't understand why I feel like this. Compared to a lot of people I'm fairly privileged so I should be fine but I'm not. I don't feel enough feelings. I hope I get my heart broken soon just so I know I can. 

Lying in bed in my own blood, not having enough energy to do anything, sometimes vaguely enjoying time with others can't be all there is to life, right?"

There isn't a reason I'm not happy, or at least a logical one, I guess. I'm just getting exhausted of the same monotony of life, and realizing even if I finish school and get a degree, am I really ever going to be comfortable in life? Finically secure on my own? I guess people's 20's is a hard time but, I feel stuck and already scared of aging. And I'm angry. I'm pissed off at people who aren't even here anymore, some of them not even alive anymore. I'm mad that they left me, and that now im here to try and figure out how to be a whole and complete person without them. None of this really makes sense, but I guess I just want to shout about it to a bunch of people I will never meet. I'm tired and I'm really not sure how much I have left in me to give back to the world. Thanks for reading."
depression,Should suicide be an option if you know there’s no getting better. I’ve already taken so many pills I don’t think my doctor know what to give me anymore. I’m non-functioning all I do is lay on the floor in my room listening to music and that’s it. Im immature depressed suicidal anxious no motivation no friends or social life and I don’t see any of it getting better. I know my sister Mom grandpa uncle and aunt would miss me but it’s a small group and could get over me and its better than seeing me slowly kill myself. I’ve already suffered for so many years and I just wanna die.
depression,"Its getting bad... Hi, newbie here to this sub, and been inactive on reddit for awhile. Really feeling bad, figured I'd give this a try...reddit used to always be a great place for me to feel uplifted.

I'm struggling, bad as hell right now, and nothing seems to be working. Theres a whole lot of back story I won't bore you with, but I'm a rape survivor, widowed twice by age 32, single mom to both deceased husbands, my mom and uncle died by suicide, and for 10yrs I've been living with undiagnosed severe chronic pain due to malpractice of shitty doctors. And so much more, to where being molested as a child doesn't even make my top 5 list of traumas. lifes been a horribly devastating ride for me. 

I'm in a good place now all things considered, I moved back to my hometown where I'm near friends and family, I started counseling again, I'm almost 2yrs in to an amazing relationship with a wonderful man who loves me, my boys are smart and kind and beautiful, I've got new doctors that are actually working on fixing the things wrong with me, really the only bad thing in my life right now is my constant physical pain.

But the depression is killing me. I just had a partial hysterectomy last month, so surely my hormones are NUTS right now, (which keeping my ovaries i didn't expect), but I'm having so much trouble just making it thru each day. I'm exhausted, I'm hurting, I can't seem to get out of bed for longer than a quick walk around the house to do whats absolutely necessary, all I can do is lay here in the dark bedroom and stress and worry and be practically paralyzed by paranoia that everything is just a second away from unraveling yet again. 

I have massive ptsd from literally a dozen traumas, and I don't know how to shut off my stupid brain from all this Negative hell. I know the normal, go for a walk, listen to music, take a hot shower, keep a journal...but what about when those things don't help? What do you do when literally nothing helps? How do I stop myself from mentally torturing myself, when its damn near constant? 

Anyways. Maybe just needed a vent, I don't even know what I'm really asking for in a response. I'm just fucking miserable, feel like shit all the time, and can't see through the awful to just be happy about the things that are good. Like my past is so damaged that it won't stop ruining the present. I hate this, and I can't make it stop."
depression,Am i depressed? A therapist once told me that if i could hang out with my friends then i wasn’t actually depressed. The thing is i get really sad and lonely i sometimes struggle to wake up and do things and concentrate. I have anxiety and have struggled with panic attacks in my teens and in these last five years ive been having thoughts of killing myself. Once i’ve even swallowed a few pills but spit them inmediatly. Sometimes my “depression” gets better but mostly i always feel disconnected and like nothing is really worth it. I can hang out with my friends and they help me a lot. It felt really contraversial since if this is not depression then... am i like this? Will this be like this forever. Im on various mediations and feel nothing. Is there other mental issues i should be thinking about?

depression,"COVID-19 is ruining my mental health My life was really looking up before coronavirus hit. Now, I wake up every day wishing I hadn't. And the worst part is that there's no end in sight. It just gets worse and worse. The economy is shot, the jobs that my major is in the process of training me for are becoming fewer and fewer (my field is one that's extremely social), I can see my hopes and dreams slipping through my fingers.

I know that it's wrong and selfish to say, but I don't care anymore: WHY do I have to give up the best years of my life for someone else? My 20s are a bust, things will never be the way they were again. I was finally getting my mental health on track, but now it's in the toilet and there don't seem to be any solutions. It's cold and dark outside, school is in full swing so I have no free time to myself, I hardly see other people when I'm out and about. I hate this. I'm just so tired. I've been thinking about it for a long time now: what to do if this never ends. To be honest, I'm sick of waiting. I see no way out of this thing and I don't want to imagine the world afterwards. I'd rather call it quits."

depression,"I’m not sure what to title this I don’t remember the last time I self harmed, but that’s mostly just because I’m too tired to. I barely do school and I just stay in my room smoking weed and vaping. I don’t really feel anything but I know that if I’m sober for too long, I won’t like what I feel. Its like I don’t even know how to feel or if I want to. I don’t understand myself anymore. I don’t know who I am or who I would want to be. I feel lost and no one sees me disappearing"

depression,"From emotional breakdown to depression I always knew what caused my severe depression and i never shared it with anyone so i finally built up the courage to write it down.. Im not a native english speaker so sorry in advance for any mistakes..

I was diagnosed with severe depression without psyhotic thoughts or whatever its called (code f32.2) few years ago after i finally built up the courage to tell my parents whats going on.. Then we found a therapist, she was great but i just wasnt enough persistent and i gave up with sessions after 2 months.. The thing is that i wasnt completely honest with her and i didnt even mention the thing that was, and still is bothering me after almost 13 years..
So im sure most of you know the feeling when your heart brakes in half because somebody you loved leaves you.. That happened to me but im pretty sure that after my heart got broken i went throught emotional breakdown which throughout few next several years caused my depression and anhedonia.
So long story short, my heart got broken when i was on summer vacation almost 13 years ago, and 1 year after that happened (i was alone in the apartment (i was 14 btw) for a week, i was high 0/24 for a week and i constantly thought about happened between us) i was walking to the beach and i saw her after a year, and i dont know wtf happened but when i saw her in the distance i got real hot in the head and after we said hi to each my heart felt like it will explode and something snapped inside me. I dont know how to describe it but it felt like everything around me lost the beauty of itself, if you get me. Since then nothing excites me, everything is mediocre to me..
7 years after that i got diagnosed with severe depression, but i stopped going after 2 months.. Im feeling a lot better since then but depression is still here, not as it used to be (i wasnt able to get out of bed) but its living inside of me and ill probably never get rid of it.

So did anyone experience the feeling i described?

Sorry for lot of text and grammar"

depression,"Not alone but lonely I guess people can relate to the title as I have family, I have a friend, I have flatmates and work colleagues but I always feel lonely. So currently going through lockdown 3.0 in the UK and might just be having an off day but I've realised just how alone and pathetic I truly am. 

I moved from London in 2019 just before the covid chaos started as it is a very toxic city to live in for mental health. I moved to the coast to start fresh and be closer to my one and only friend. I have had ""friends"" in the past but everytime I've been in a relationship (all of which never last longer than 9 months) they all eventually go with her. I'm not bitter about it but more noticing that they weren't my friends to begin with. My one and only friend is being more adult with his life in the sense that he has a decent job, a gf and is buying a home with her which is awesome (genuinely mean that not being sarcastic).

Anyway back to today. Through this lockdown I've realised that I really don't have anything or anyone meaningful in life. No luck with relationships, no luck with people in general. I've had depression and social anxiety for years but has this made me broken and unloveable? Am I not allowed to be happy with someone? 

Dw not suicidal. I've been down that pit of dispair and it's not worth it. Hell no-one probably reads these anyway and I'm just ranting."

i feel like i’m losing touch of what i’ve worked so hard to get to and i don’t want it to get too blurry to the point where i feel like i have to restart again 
i’ve been doing so good i’ve been doing so good i can’t stress that enough 
i cant feel like the most responsible all the time i feel like i cant get along with anyone

depression,"Why are people so argumentative and mean I had a date with maryjane, so I am in a relatively good mood. I was scrolling through Reddit, trying to send some positive vibes, and this guy on a post I had submitted wanted to have a debate over my ideology. I was not in the mood. I told him have a nice day, but he still wanted to debate, so I blocked him and deleted the post. On top of that, so other lady did not like that I shared the history of kale! She actually had a fit about it!? Sorry, crazy kale lady, the truth is the truth..

I am no longer posting my opinions on that sub and will make generic posts. How absolutely stupid it is! Why does it matter if someone does not agree with you. Why have a tantrum over kale and different countries view different animals?! 

The other day, someone got pissed because I said women have more privacy in public restrooms, than men because women usually have periods?! I somehow excluded trans women?! Um.. I was just commenting on a question the poster had! WTF is wrong with people?! I am glad Dems are hopefully going to legalize pot. It seems to me a great many people seem to need to just chill out!

Social media should be a place you can learn, share, spread ideas, vent, get support, and be apart of a bigger community. I mean many of us are stuck at home because of Covid 19. There are many of us that only see family. Why be a jerk when the whole world is suffering? I have no understanding of that. 

It really makes me wonder if we, as the people, are even worth the effort. But than I see what some brilliant kid invented a autonomous boat that cleans the ocean. Some girls discovered a enzyme to disintegrate plastic. I hear of a young kid who adopted an old cat a loving home. I read how someone helped others, and it returns. Then I see my kids, grown and making lives of their own, and really want to watch their life story play out. But there will always be that part of me that just wants to give up. Life is so hard. It is not been an easy life for me. I am just so tired of all the heartache, sadness, selfishness and evil just want to give up. I just feel so broken sometimes.. It feels like I will never escape the ghosts of the past. It does not help to feel like you are in lockdown. 

I feel like people can see I am defective. Why can't life be easy sometimes. Why can't I just be happy. I just feel like a freak."

Or just finishing in an hospital was great for me, I just want a break from living. I took for about 2g of venlafaxine with some painkillers. I woke up like 10 hours later and It felt like I was not there at all. I couldn't hear or see well. I was dizzy but not feeling bad at all. that day I just played in my bed and I felt extremely tired. I threw up once but only a little amount. The color of my vomit was brown  and I was really weird. But I haven't told anyone yet. I can't get myself to talk at all. today I feel alright. I'm just not 100% there. I don't know if I can actually go to school this week. If it becomes too much I'll try and talk to her just to maybe go to the emergency. But I don't even want to get better. living a life is so fucking long. way too long for me to be happy. all I do is waiting all the time. I can't do anything now and I'm just becoming scared of every little sound that I hear. is there someone that can relate to that ? or that experienced something similar ?"
depression,"Never been under more pressure..and never had less getting me through it I'm 26,

Working helpdesk for a cloud services company. Been doing my best since the start of the pandemic to cope and learn what I can. Things have been getting progressively worse. Let me tell you I hate this so much. I hate getting calls from angry customers, hate that pressure. Its becoming more and more often I get calls like that because lay offs happened and we have less coverage than ever.

I am spending most of my time in a call queue for a different department I'm not trained for and normally would never be in and now I don't have the freedom to look at my own tickets and theres a time limit on those tickets to get them closed. I'm grateful I still have a job but I don't know how much worse it can get before they let me go. I'm getting killed.

I wish I had a good girl to make things feel better but every time I meet someone I think would want to be with they are always taken or they blow me off. Not even worth it to wake up in the morning anymore for me. I just wanted a wife, a family, and to live a good life with them. Chances for that are looking slimmer every day. I know no one cares but you gotta get this out somehow. Thanks for reading."
depression,"Bullied by stepdad. No where else to go. Almost all my life I get bullied by him. He keeps getting worser. I tried to move out the house and find a job, but this pandemic made it harder. My mom takes his side and blames me for the fault. And he laughs when he sees me cry. At this point I feel like killing myself. There's no hope for me. Not even God's miracle will save me from the hell I'm in. I'm crying and I dont know what to do anymore."
depression,Not today I guess I literally was stuck sitting on my bed for 2 hours arguing with myself over getting up and getting my clothes ready for work or putting a pillow case over my head and throwing a .40 through my skull
depression,"I can't accept that after we die there's simply nothing. If I was born once, who guarantees that I won't be reborn again? I'm almost sure that I'll be reborn in another kind of animal. Even under anesthesia it only lasts a second in unconscious mode and then we wake up."
depression,"I can't just deal with it anymore, and I'm seeking antidepressants for the first time PSA - Sorry, this is a really negative post.

I don't even know if they're right for me, or if they'll let me have any. I'm just so sick of relapsing, asking for help and being shoved aside for a month or three while they 'intake' me into the mental health services schedule. By the time I can speak to someone I've already dealt with it the hard way and then they just dredge everything up and give me a bunch of stupid coping mechanisms I already know as if they're magical new knowledge. I hate this. The last time I 'got better' everything was so perfect and lovely and so many physical symptoms and issues went away so quickly that I really, truly believed that I'd just had situational depression the whole time, and I was going to be okay. But then something small happens, something that should just make me feel a bit down and here I am crying hysterically on the bathroom floor because my doctor can only see me tomorrow, not today, and burning myself in the shower because I think I deserve it and I'm too stupid and weak to really hurt myself. I took St John's wort before and it made me feel dead, and I didn't like it, I didn't want to feel like that so I said I wouldn't try antidepressants. But I just want to feel dead now."
depression,"Why the fuck do i keep trying to be a good person when everyone just treats me like some fucking garbage anyways I tried so hard to be the perfect kid to please my parents and everyone else but im such a fuck up. My moms been telling me to kill myself for 4 years shes even almost even killed me herself but i still tell myself she loves me. My dad's never been an actual father to me and no matter how hard I try im not gonna fuckin fix that before he dies. My parents put me through so much im never gonna be normal, im never gonna be truly happy, im never gonna truly feel loved in the way that other people can. 




Idc if someone actually reads this I just wanted to feel like I had someone to talk to about my stupid shit before i get my dads gun"
depression,"Not even my therapist understands the shit I'm going through ^(Therapist or whatever the fuck it is called)

She said we'll probably stop seeing each other in a couple of weeks, that was the last chance i had to not kill myself and to live a normal life

Maybe I can look for someone else, especially someone who prescribes shit, I don't want to hear about tea or being told to take a shit, bitch i came here for my depression

Maybe someone who doesn't consider me childish for seeking help or that doesn't invalidate all my problems

How can she think she can help people like that? Seriously, that's why drugs exist, to prescribe them and help people, you wouldn't go to someone who has cancer and tell them you won't let them have a surgery because it didn't exist thousands of years ago, like fuck off

She keeps telling me she's studied, then how come she doesn't get that she's just making everything worse? You are supposed to know that telling someone with anxiety to just tell you everything or send you and email just doesn't work since you're specialized in that but apparently that's now how it works


I don't know what to do, haven't got anything to live for, wake at 3 am eating chocolate instead of sleeping, thinking I should lose weight but haven't done anything about it in all my life, never felt the motivation to do anything, never felt joy, never felt anything really in my whole life, nobody cares about me, i don't even have any friend, never done anything useful"
depression,"When I was 15 my teacher told me to have realistic standards in life Even mentioned you'll only be in a relationship with someone as good as you, 13 years later I think about this often as a reminder that I'm nothing"
depression,"Reading seems to be the true cure to my depression I just wanted to read something positive that I've recently discovered. I exercise like crazy, try to be as gregarious as possible to truly help combat my depression. But no matter what I always find myself on a lonely weekend getting down, which is inevitable. I usually try to go for a walk, just try to change the scenery so I can get my mind off which usually works. Last year I tried reading when I feel that way, and it works. I read for an hour and I get up and I feel so much better, as if I never felt sad at all. Back to my normal self, motivated, and excited. It's strange but to anyone who is struggling, pick up a good book and take an hour. I think reading is subtle meditation for your mind to help keep your thoughts and necessities copacetic in your mind."
depression,"I'm going to mentally spiral farther down if I fail at this new job I can't say this to anyone I know IRL. 
I've been frantically looking for work for over a month. I try to work out. I read self-help books by psychologists. I have wonderful friends and acquaintances. I can tolerate most of my family. I try to go with the flow. I'm happy to be living alone. I love the city where I currently live.

This search for a 2nd job has almost completely destroyed any progress I've made on improving my mental health. I am due to start my second job tomorrow. I don't know if I will be able to hold on to my remaining mental stability if I fail this new job."
depression,"I am sick of all the people saying that ""I can't kms because I don't want to hurt my family"" As the title says, each time I look through peoples' posts of what stopping you from killing yourself, the single most frequent reason I see is not wanting to hurt one's parents. 

I never felt attached to my family, tbh I fuckin despise them. 

Even though I was beaten occasionally, the physical abuse didn't really hurt that much, but all of my life, they made me believe that I am unworthy of love if I didn't achieve something, that my grades, achievements and devotion to God are the only things that matter, and whenever I did something 'morally' wrong they would tell me in great details how I failed them and how much of a disappointment I am.

I put 'morally' in quotes marks because it's not objectively wrong, for example when they caught me watching porn, I got beaten of course, but what sticks in my mind to this day, is how my parents looked at me with disgust and despise for watching some porn as a teenager, and they made sure to discipline me in front of my big brothers. 

Another example is when I don't go to the mosque to pray with them, the amount of disappointment and contempt they show is immeasurable, it's like I am waste of oxygen.

One frequent insult I received a lot was how much corrupt I am, and that I was bad from the time I was just an egg, I will leave it to your imagination what were the 'horrible' things I did to receive such insults.

All of these memories and emotions made me turn into the most cynical person you will ever see, and even though I am graduated from medical school, I couldn't feel a single spark of joy or sense of achievement from it, mostly because I was forced to do it even tho I didn't have any interest in medicine.

It physically pains me when I see people showing affection in public, especially between parents and children, because I feel so jealous and envious by it. And I don't think I have ever heard the words ""I love you"" from anyone, not even my mother. 

I have been thinking about suicide for more than 10 years now, and each time I think about it I wish I could see how my family would react, I want them to feel guilty, I want them to know that I am like this because of them, I want them to be consumed and shattered with guilt and agony. 

But of course if I died I won't be able to see any of this.

Even though I don't see any point in living, and I feel my life is worthless, the hope of experiencing love and acceptance one day is what makes me keep on living."
depression,"I’m (m17) broken and I feel my depression getting worse My girlfriend just broke up with me. She was my everything and now I have to return a Valentine’s Day gift. Even when we were dating my grades in school were considerably lower than they were last year due to depression. I just don’t know what to do. Depression has always been apart of my life but now the pain is so great I don’t know what to do. I’ve hit a wall with my medication, therapy doesn’t help, and the thought of seeing them even in online school makes me want to throw up. Not posted on an alt account bc I genuinely don’t care anymore it feels like my life is in free fall and death is in only a matter of time."
depression,"I'm so tired... My life has felt like one big running joke. I'm turning 22 on the 24th of this month. I've been depressed since I was maybe 13..I grew up in a toxic home with a manipulative mother who constantly gaslit me and made me feel like a burden on her life. She denied me having depression and would tell me to get over it, or that I was too young to feel that way, or that it was a phase. Because of her I never got the real help I needed. When I finally did get depression meds they made me feel even worse. I've been through so many emotionally and sexually abuse relationships where men used me until they were tired of me. And now I actually live in another state with the love of my life and our pet...and I feel like the only reason I choose to stay here is because of them. My boyfriend is why I wake up every day. I want to marry him and have a future...but life is still so incredibly painful. I work a shitty job and I'm barely making any money to save or spend, and I don't know how I'm supposed to plan for a future when I barely make any money. I know I could get another job but I like my coworkers and I hate starting over at a new place so much..because I'm shy and everyone usually thinks I'm a bitch because I'm quiet or they think I'm just the weird fat girl no one cares about. I hate my body so much and I've been big ever since I started having depression...I've done so much to lose weight and it's so hard to keep up with being healthy and I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror and I don't like people taking photos of me because I feel so disgusting. I've self harmed because I feel so gross and I experience dysmorphia. I just hate everything about my life except for my boyfriend and I really don't think I would be here anymore if it wasn't for him."
depression,"i just wanna be able to accept happiness my boyfriend does almost everything right but I just can’t accept the fact that he loves me and that he does want be with me and that he won’t leave me for someone else? i make everything an argument and just self sabotage and fight and fight it’s like i can’t control it. i tear everyone around me apart until they feel like they’re nothing and want to literally kill themselves, i can’t stop being nasty as fuck and ruining everything for myself like what the hell. just for some reason can’t let myself feel anything other than earth shattering sadness or feeling so empty and emotionless that I feel like I have a literal hole in my chest, i can’t handle it anymore, i just want to be happy and not feel like I’m nothing to anyone"
depression,"Grief Podcast I just launched a grief podcast in December. While we discuss loss and death, we also explore grief in all its forms like breakups, trauma, illness, sobriety, depression, even COVID. If you would like to check it out, you can find it here: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/emotional-duct-tape/id1546935588](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/emotional-duct-tape/id1546935588)"
depression,"Been sick longer than I've been well And the one moment when i was actually healthy i felt so lost and afraid i almost killed myself. So i've relapsed, because i know very well how to be sick, but have no idea how to be well. I dont know what healthy life looks like.   


All i want to do is disassociate and disappear. To turn off all of my emotions, stop talking to everyone and drift. Then i can finally relax. I'm exhausted. Working on my burned-out brain is so hard.   


But i've already lost 7 years to disassociation.  7 years with no feelings. Living like a robot. It makes me sad when i think about it. Everything I've missed.   


I need to keep fighting. Even if it does kill me."
depression,I’ve been in a depressive episode for months Hi guys. So basically i’m just ranting and also seeing if anybody else is going through / went through this and can help me out. At the beginning of corana i was so happy i had a best friend i talked to quite a lot and other friends and my mental health was just good overall. Beginning the end of last year it just completely crumbled and i’ve been so depressed for months and i just want it to stop. I don’t have any best friends i do have friends but i just feel like i don’t relate to anybody. i have a bf but he has a busy life so i can’t always rely on him all the time. I want to do something with my life because i feel like everyday is the same i’m so sad. I work part time but when i don’t work i just sit at home and feel so alone. Even when i’m with friends i feel so alone. I don’t really have any hobbies or anything  . Ik this is long i’m sorry i just went on ranting . But if you read through this i was wondering does anybody have any advice ? i’m just so tired of feeling like this
depression,"I don't know what's wrong First of all this is a throwaway account.

I've got some good friends, a fiancè a child even getting trained for a job I should be happy I'm trying to be happy. But I feel always so tiered. Due to lockdown I'm not working still can't even do dishes. It seems like I can't feel anything I'm having this for years. I cried like 3 Hrs in silence because I don't want my fiancé to hear it. I had birthday a few days ago we got a 'child-free-day' it was really fun we watched some movies and ordered some food but now I'm a mess again smoking a cigarette at 4 in the morning because I can't sleep. Also I haven't had good relationships until I met my current. Now my fiancé got accusations for cyber crimes she didn't do. We are not rich so It will be very difficult to find a lawyer and I don't want loose her. I don't know if I'm depressed or just a whiny mess."
depression,"I'm going to relapse because my cat died I have been self-harm free for many months now. The last time I did it was out of impulse when my grandad died, then I went cold turkey. 
Anyway.

I've thought it through and I'm willing to throw away all my progress for this. Ive even become more open with my family and am finally comfortable with wearing short sleeves around them. But I don't care. I don't know how else to handle my cat's death. She was my best friend and my baby. I'm completely heartbroken. She wasn't meant to die--my dad let her outside at night and now she's gone.

Worst part about it is that before she died, I was the happiest I had been in years. I had finally gained some self confidence, was developing a positive outlook on life, discovered my passion for cooking, could function without my antidepressants, ect. And guess what? It was all for nothing. I can barely even get out of bed now and when I'm awake all I can think about is her. I'm right back where I started and I feel distraught and hurt. I just needed to get this off my chest."
depression,Good news or bad news? Who knows Today I learned my belt can successfully hold my body weight when my closet door is closed. Don’t know what to do with this information.
depression,"Welp I've tried therapy. Usless, I felt nothing. I've tried pills. Still nothing. Unless tonight goes off course and I lose the confidence, well these are my final hours. I'm putting this here so I don't hurt real world friends and have them help a lost cause. But I still wanted a note somewhere. I suppose this is good bye. Have a good 2021. I am sorry."
depression,"life is a humiliation Sorry this is sort of a thought dump of issues I have and see.    
life is a humiliating thing.  i don't know,  i don't feel good with my words right now.  but it's like life is one series of difficult humiliations after another.  i tried to speak in a really honest way to my SO yesterday but it just came out gobbledygook, and he didn't get what i was saying i feel.  Just a blank expression and there was no point in keeping trying cause it just wasn't coming through or something, so I went to bed then.  And now I have this embarrassing conversation I know I had, which before i was not talking about it cause I didn't want to be put in this vulnerable place and I think I had been right all along to not talk.  And that is where I always find myself, that it would have been better to say nothing, to be quiet, when talking to really anyone.    
I think that when you are in the place where you are struggling things compound and get that much harder to get back to what normal life is supposed to be like.  For instance you are less likely to know how to talk to people, so you shut yourself away so as not to cause a problem, which then you become even less good at connecting as time goes on.  Or like meeting goals, when you're depressed or something is going on it gets harder to meet the goals that equate to success at what you are trying to do which then next time around you are farther down, still trying to keep going and it is just even harder.  So depression type problems have a terrible spiral issue that makes it so much harder to get back out of it.   
this year for me has been a series of panic attacks, i have been caregiver to my dad, and my mother now visits, and he has health problems, and it's been half a year like this.  except my childhood was really bad.  i get terrible panic attacks when i see my mother still.  i have to deal with what could be emergencies with my dad all the time.   And as I maybe mentioned i have a sneaking suspicious I maybe have PTSD, and so it always feels like I am constantly just scared and stressed completely.  And I have no idea when this pressure will go away and when things can get a little better."
depression,"It's 3am and I'm lonely I don't know what to write, but I wanted to write something. I feel so alone, so tired. It's almost 3am, and I have an online lesson at 8:30. I can't sleep at all, recently I've been going to bed at about 5am.

All my friends say they support me, and that they understand. But they don't have a clue what's going on, I barely even know. But all my parents do is tell me I'm not good enough, and that I need to do more, and work harder. ""there's no point looking forward to good things, if you're too lazy to get out of bed"".

Most of the time they treat me as if I'm invisible until there's a problem. They see me every day, unable to escape each other because of the virus, and yet the fact that I have been wearing the same clothes for a month and am always skipping meals, goes over their heads. I think they don't care. They don't even see the little things and changes. They have a person to take their frustrations and anxiety out on and that's all they have to think about. I miss being their son. 

I'm really tired. Ik it's stupid. I guess I'll just post in the hopes that someone else feeling shit, sees they aren't alone."
depression,"Please tell me it gets easier I'm suicidal. I have anxiety &amp; I've been struggling on &amp; off with depression for the better part of a decade.

But I've been trying, I want to be better, but I don't even know where to start, I've tried journaling; meditation; talking it out, but that last one is where the problem mostly is.

I tried talking it out with my best friend of 10 years: we're no longer best friends.

I tried talking about it with my boyfriend: he just broke up with me.

I want to be better for my family, my brothers &amp; my parents, my dad also has depression &amp; has told me that he's had suicidal thoughts; I've heard about things like the domino effect, what if I really do kill myself &amp; he does the same? I think I'd die all over again.

I want to be better for myself, I hate feeling worthless all the time, but it's hard when I feel like I am, &amp; that no one really loves me.

I know... I'm pretty sure my family does, but as much as it pains me to admit, it doesn't do much for me: I feel like it's more of an obligation than anything else.

It's hard to feel loved when everyone without any obligation to stick around who's ever claimed to love me has left.

I guess I'm just feeling extra blue since my boyfriend just broke up with me- I mean ""just"" quite literally: it was today, he was my first love, &amp; my first boyfriend, &amp; I really thought we'd work: we met each other's families, we talked about everything- good &amp; bad, I feel so stupid, because we'd only been dating for several months, but we spent it almost entirely together until around the end.

I was coming out of a really rough friend break-up when we first got together, I guess that's why I got attached so quickly.

I used to think that he loved me, &amp; wanted to stay with me: it didn't fix all my problems, but it gave me the energy to try &amp; do it myself.

Now that's gone, &amp; I just need SOMETHING, cause I still can't make myself stop crying.

I'm only in my twenties, I'm too young to be feeling like this, it's not that I don't feel like there's anything left, I know there's a lot left to do, or see, or feel- but I'm losing the will to experience it; I'm losing the will to keep living, I don't want to die though, I just want to stop being hurt by the people I trust the most.



TL: DR

Tell me that things get easier after breaking up with your first love, because I dove in head first, &amp; now it fucking hurts."
depression,its 3am rn lol you ever want someone to sell you on the black market so you know you're worth something?
depression,feeling very low again i fucking knew it would happen
depression,"I hate when I get connected with someone and then they become distant. I understand people have their own lives to live but, why get close to someone just to fall back? It seems that people only want to talk to me when they are going through their own issues. But, what if I gave back that same energy?! Like I don't care about being alone but, don't come into my space and flake afterwards. 

It's making me desensitized to people in general! Like I don't even have the energy to deal with all the same people just different bodies."
depression,"Intrusive thoughts For some reason sometimes I have intrusive thoughts about someone getting hurt, and I hate it. I don't really want they to get hurt. I want them to be safe, but I can't stop thinking that something is going to happen to them. What should I do? I get nervous because I feel that my thoughts are going to come true. I hate it so much."
depression,"I wish I had so much to say then when I went to type I blanked out. I just hate how I know nothing about myself and I hate everything right now. I can't listen to music, I can't watch tv, I can't read books. I'm so scared of being a poser or liking someone else's territory? I don't even know.

And Im so tired of people saying ""oh I understand how hard depression is"" then with the same breath start lecturing you about how dirty your room is when all your room has are just clothes on the floor because at least I can keep up throwing thrash, food, random things away I just can't put clothes away. And I hate working so much and only coming home to a $500 check bi-weekly and feeling drained every. single. fucking. day even on my days off.

I hate feeling like my life is being wasted crying in bed because that's all I can fucking do I don't have the stupid energy to do anything else but cry and wish I knew myself more or wish I didn't feel so lost or wish I wasn't so scared to try new things. And I wish I had people around me and I wish my parents weren't fucking so silent towards me. I wish I had people to talk to and I wish someone actually cared. I wish so much that I know 3/4 of this won't even come true.

I wish I didn't feel like college is pointless because I have no interest or the attention span to do it. I wish I didn't spend so much time self loathing and dropping out of my classes 2 weeks in and wasting my money. I wish I could just go outside and not be scared of getting kidnapped or murdered just because I have a vagina. 

I just really wish I knew myself. At least something. A hobby? or music? or something. God."
depression,"When to live Too much of a coward to put a bullet in my head. Every day is fucking work and honestly don’t know where to start. My marriage is fucked, wife has extensive behavioral issues and refuses to get any type of help. She breaks down at the first sight of things not working. We have two kids under 4 and I’m taking them to and from daycare everyday. She works part time and yet most of the time she has to stay late meaning that I have to go get them after work. I work full time in the military yet still find time to make shit work. Hardly have time to even be with any of my actual friends yet my wife complains about how I make friends every station I’ve been at. Recently set up a fitness routine with a friend from work and invited my wife to come along to feel a part of something. That didn’t last long as she had a freakout sound my friend because i had to go into work earlier than normal and wanted to workout with my friend. Like the entire day I’m getting my phone blown up about how I’m not supporting her I’m getting better and shit because my friend at the gym is there for me. I mean it’s weird to work out with another friend’s wife. But she doesn’t seem to understand. I do love her but every day feels like I’m lighting myself on fire to keep her warm. I have many more reasons but I’m at the point where my life doesn’t matter, and don’t know why my children deserve me as a father. I was happy at one point but now I feel like Kurt cobain’s “you know you’re right” more relevant than ever."
depression,"I don’t know where to go from here... Hello, obviously this is a throwaway account because i intend to post this and never look back. I just need to throw it out there for somebody to read. 

Why? I Don’t know to be quite honest. The fact that im writing this feels childish but my impulses got the better of me so here goes. 

My father founded a chain of gasstations that operate all over europe. That’s all im willing to disclose though, you’ll just have to take my word for it. If not thats fine too. The point i’m making is, i come from a family with a lot of money. 

And i’m utterly miserable. 

Nothing can give me a glimpse happiness. Absolutely nothing. Not love, not travel, not expensive clothes, cars, jewelry. Nothing. I don’t think i’ve cried since i was 13 years old. I just feel numb, nothingness. Have for a long time now. 

When it was time for me to go to high school my father suggested i go to Collège Stanislas de Paris. A catholic boarding school in France. 2000 miles from home. He convinced me by telling me all these stories on how amazing France was and how it was going to be an adventure for me. Because he was my dad I believed him i accepted and got sent out the following month.  

A few months after arriving in France my mother called me telling me my dad was selling the company and retiring from business all together. At first i was really exited, one of the main reasons of me leaving home was because my dad told me they simply didn’t have enough time to take care of me. My mom was also a very prominent figure in the business so she was never really there to be a mom. She never really wanted to. I think having a kid was more my dad’s thing. Anyway, i asked my mom if my dad’s retirement meant i could come home. She told me in a passive aggressive tone that i had to finish what i started so reluctantly i caved and agreed to stay. 

When summer rolled around my father visited me for a day and told me he and my mom were gonna take a trip. Basically a 4 month vacation to asia to relax and enjoy some “well deserved rest” that summer. After he left the realization kicked in. My parents pawned me off just so they could do whatever they wanted while i got tucked away in a summer school. Keep in mind i was 14 at the time so I felt betrayed and sold off. Especially because i wasn’t even allowed to go back home. I never cared about going to exotic places or expensive resorts. I just wanted to spend time with my parents like a normal family. They cut me out of everything. 

I started acting out as a cry for attention from my parents. I threw my computer through a glass door at school, i took a door out of the hinges so that when a teacher opened the door it would immediately drop on their heads, i even lit my room on fire. Yet, they never listened, i don’t even think they ever really cared. I never got scolded or in trouble so i think that proves it. I’ve always resented them for abandoning me. 

I graduated two years ago and I decided to stay in Paris. Believe me, not because i like it. Frankly, i hate this place. I hate the people, i hate the city, i even hate the pigeons sitting on my balcony right now. But i cant go back home, i don’t even feel like a native of my birth country anymore. I belong nowhere. 

I hate being me. One thing i hear all the time after meeting people and them finding out who my parents are is “you must live a pretty awesome life huh?” 

No. No i don’t. It fucking sucks. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I never let any girl get close to me in fear of them taking advantage of me. I have literally 0 friends. If i die right now i wouldn’t even know how long it would take for somebody to find me. Could be weeks. 

I’ve been isolating myself for the past 25 days. 
Im all alone now, and i have no idea what the fuck im going to do with the rest of my life. The fear of living like this for the rest if my life far outweighs the fear of death.

depression,I don't care I'm tired of trying in life. I'm tired of worrying about things I can't control. I'm tired of ignorant people. I'm tired of false happiness. I'm tired of covid. I'm tired of politics. I have no purpose. Why am I here. I wish I was swallowed.
depression,"Pain The pain is so bad today, nothing is working. All I want to do is lay in bed all day, I don't want to eat or drink. I just want to close my eyes and fade away"
depression,Why What the fuck is even the point in living anymore nothing new happens and I don’t have anyone to talk to because no one would listen or care. I don’t have any friends to talk too and I’m too embarrassed to go to a therapist. The one thing I want to do so bad is die because I never see a point in anything.
depression,"I Pushed Away All my Friends I don't know if this sub reddit is right for this post, and if it aint then delete it. But, I recently as the name suggests pushed all my pals away after a fight. I deleted them off all social media and said some real mean nasty stuff. Yet I don't feel bad, despite no longer having any friends I don't feel bad, not at all; I feel nothing."
depression,"Should I stay home or head out? (please, no COVID comments) Depression makes it hard for me to really want to do anything much. The only thing I’ve done recently has been laying in bed for hours on end (I’ve removed myself off of social media, so there’s not even that to scroll on), going to work, or going to therapy. I haven’t really headed out to enjoy my own company and chill at a cafe in a while (few weeks). Today is my off day after 4 days of work, with another work dah tomorrow, and for the past couple of days I’ve been feeling extra restless in the evenings (like feeling extra empty and weird, always asking family if they plan to eat out for dinner, etc.). The restlessness follows me into my off days &amp;amp; weekends, feeling like I SHOULD be doing something. 

As soon as I get the motivation to get myself out of the house, that idea comes crashing back down on me a minute later and I start thinking “that’s so far / but I just went there / it’s so expensive / that sounds so tiresome / maybe I should just stay home / I don’t feel like I have the energy for it”. So... today has been a dilemma on whether or not to grab a book and head out to a library or cosy cafe to chill for a bit, and so I’m open to votes — should I stay home, or head out? 





*On a side note, before anyone wants to remark “COVID”, I am not in a high risk country. My country currently has close to 0 community cases daily (with frequent testing), even with it starting to reintegrate back into business-as-usual once again. After spending the whole of 2020 under strict orders and implementing safety precautions, we are legally allowed to be out and about as long as we do so responsibly and adhere to rules and precautions. Any going out on my part will be done responsibly.*"
depression,"Can I pls have some help Hello All hoping your well and staying safe from covid 

I had depression and anxiety for a year and lately I’ve been feeling down with in myself even though I have my family and friends near. I don’t understand why I’m feeling like this. I take medication and it works but just a different time of the day I get this stupid feeling of loneliness , sadness and just a strange mixture of feelings. 

Any help would be highly appricated 

Thanks for your time"
depression,"I physically feel my heart hurting I'm just feel this tightness in the center of my heart, like someone is squeezing it in their hand. Every day, every minute, every second. It rarely goes away. Even if something good happens its always overshadowed by what I'm failing at. I just want it to stop. But I know that won't happen until I solve what the hell it is I'm doing with my life 😔"
depression,"advice (?) i’m not sure this is really even the right place to go but i’m almost never confident in what i feel and always somehow think i’m in the wrong even when it’s plainly obvious to others that i’m not. a really close friend of mine recently stopped talking to me and i found out a few days ago they blocked me on everything. i think i know why and it’s nothing i did, but am i in the wrong or being unreasonable for being really pissed at them and feeling abandoned? this all happened shortly after i made it abundantly clear i was doing terribly mentally and was in a really shitty situation. i understand that people are going through their own things of course, but i just felt so worthless to this person."
depression,"I’m so self conscious of my depression teeth I didn’t brush them consistently for awhile when I was in my darkest depression days, so now they’re yellow and a bit blotchy. I know it’s not my fault but I can’t help but feel so embarrassed by them. I see all these social media people having pearly white teeth and it makes me so jealous.

I just wish I was normal. The worst part is, I know I’ll continue to have problems with them as I get older because I didn’t take care of them well for like 4-5 years straight. I know it’s a little thing but it honestly makes me want to kill myself because I can’t do much to fix it"
depression,"Dear Cat Dear cat,

I adopted you as a kitten because you screamed at me when I picked you up, and didn't stop until I put you down. You still do the same every time I pick you up, and every time I piss you off. Whether that be from petting you wrong, not letting you riot outside the doors of your home, to walking the wrong way causing you to jump up and dig your claws into my calf and bite. You don't purr, but often times I catch you kneading out pink blanket when you think I'm asleep and I put my hand so gently on your. throat, to which I'm met with a soft vibration yet no sounds. 

I got you when my depression was worst. my junior year of high school. When I was suffering from addiction the hardest, and the least understood due to age. You gave me a distraction, I got to play with you all day, and you'd willingly fall asleep on my chest nights I cried harder than ever. You're a terror, from biting me for simply just looking in your direction. So god help me if I run down the hallway, because you're right on my ass ready to pounce and attack when I stop. You're the definition of feisty and a mean cat.

Until you're not. Until I'm sobbing for hours about how alone I feel in the world. How nothing stops my tears, or at least that's what I thought. Then you roam into my room, and jump on my bed. During the daytime you refuse to be seen snuggling up to my blanket, but I catch you around 1 in the morning every night at the corner of my bed, against your favorite pink blanket that you knead nightly and nibble into. Yet, here you are 10 at night rubbing your face against my knee. You rest peacefully on my chest. You're not one for movements, but you stay as my stomach shakes from sobbing. You let me pet you without biting me, and I even feel a purr as I pet you. As my tears slow down, you take your place right next to me and lay down, something that seldom happens. Even on your back too, so I get to pet your stomach. It's like you knew I needed a friend, I needed to feel loved.

I don't deserve a cat so loving."
depression,"My Boyfriend has been Making me depressed Hi everyone, so I’ve been depressed lately more then usual my bf keeps provoking me and saying hurtful things that make me feel like I’m a horrible person and never good enough"
depression,"Grief and trauma causing awful nightmares... It's a little past 1am and I just woke up sobbing violently from an awful nightmare. I'm so shaken up and needed to get it out somewhere, even if no one sees it this late at night. 

I've had so much hurt in my life personally in 2020, and day to day I think I've been coping by becoming apathetic and numb, but this dream shows me that I am still carrying so much grief and trauma inside me. I met a lot of bad people this year, people who only led me on, used me, hurt me, and then abandoned me. I had little trust to give, but I gave it to these people hoping they wouldn't abuse it and it backfired on me horribly. 

In my dream though, I met some guy. I liked him and trusted him, I went over to his place and thought all was well. But, he ended up drugging me or doing something to me where I was dizzy and uncoordinated, he pushed me around until I was stumbling and falling, and then the really awful part was that he started to throw gas or lighter fluid at me and then pulled out a lighter while walking towards me. I started screaming and screaming and screaming, and eventually woke myself up bawling and shaking. 

Obviously the dream was very violent and nothing quite so horrific has happened to me, but I think it brought out my underlying trauma of being lied to, led on, and ultimately hurt by people and developing severe trust issues as a result. I don't know how to cope with this."
depression,Am I depressed or is it just edginess? I've been having suicidal thoughts for about 2-3 years. I would have thoughts of killing myself every here and there but was to scared to at the thought of harming myself. These depressive episodes usually fades away for a couple of weeks but then come back. I usually shrugged these thoughts as me being edgy but am wondering now if I should talk to someone about this? I am 15 by the and about to turn 16.
depression,"Relief I dont know why i feel like this. Why im like this. Maybe i deserve it. I just want everything to stop. I just want to sleep a really long while. Some kind of relief. But i cant even sleep anymore. The days blend together in a blur and im just here. I feel still while everything around me blaze about. I dont even feel human anynore. The only kind of reprieve i get from myself is to picture myself dying, over and over again. It's the only thing i can fixate on.  But i cant do it in actuality. There are people that love me and i wish that were enough. Why am i like this? Id like very much just like to not be here anynore."
depression,"After tomorrow I won't be here anymore I'm sure I won't be here after tomorrow, I tried to cut my throat and wrist with my machete but I couldn't convince myself to cut hard enough because it hurts so much. Tomorrow I might get a rope and hang myself near the graveyard. I've been getting drunk every night since 21, and lately I've been drinking half fifths of whiskey. I can't deal with anything anymore, no escape. Tomorrow is my judgement day. To anyone reading this, if you feel anything like I do, please get help. You don't want to end up like me. You have people that love you. I do to, but it's not worth it anymore. I've been calling off of work because of the way I feel, to the point that I'm going to lose my job. I need my job but they don't understand what I've been going through, no one does. I've been off medication and drinking, don't make the same mistakes I've made. Get help, and get better.

depression,"It's almost 3 am and I feel like my life is falling apart. What do you even do when you have family and friends who criticize the things that make you feel the happiest? What do you do when your own father tells you he doesn't want to attend your wedding? What do you do when your friends want to protect you by trying to take away the only person you can trust?

These are just few of several situations I've been dealing with for years now and I'm getting sick of it. I'm sick of my friends and family thinking they know what's best for me, I'm sick of them criticizing my relationship when just being next to him is the happiest I'll ever feel anymore. I'm sick of them jumping to conclusions, assuming that I'm not happy with my relationship just because I don't talk about it much.

This is the first time in my life where I've genuinely felt like dying would be the best way out. It's been on my mind for weeks. I've also thought about moving far away with my fiancé and not telling anyone else, just starting a whole new life. 

All of the chaos going on in the world is contributing to my feelings of emptiness. I feel like I no longer have a purpose here on Earth. Every day, my body is on autopilot while my mind destroys me with the constant dark thoughts. Once I realized that I couldn't trust even my friends and family anymore, is when I lost every ounce of my faith in the human race. I daydream constantly about having real friends who don't judge me. I replay old scenarios in my head that make me lose sleep at night. I think of worse-case scenarios. I think of how alone I really am in this world. 

I'm supposed to be seeing my fiancé around 9 o'clock in the morning but I can't fall asleep because all of these dark thoughts are taking over. I guess I'll just have to try to run on little sleep as usual."
depression,"I know I'm loved But I still feel so lonely and unloved. I've been thinking lately a lot about how much I want to be loved. But I know I am. I know my wife would do anything to help me feel better but I'm afraid to tell her I don't want her to think I don't  love her, cause I do. I just feel so lost and empty. I lost my job last month and I have no idea if I can get unemployment because I was already on it for my second job which I lost about a year and a half ago. And at the beginning of 2020 when I was furloughed for 2 months. I just really wish I wasn't so dumb and lost my job. After 5 years I was just getting used to my co-workers. And I threw it all away because I couldn't control my emotions. I'm still so ashamed. My wife said it could end up being a good thing. But so far I've already got two ""no's"". The only reason I've had the jobs I've had was because people I knew worked there before hand and put in a good word. I no longer have that advantage. Did you know job applications ask if you have a mental illness now? And depression is on the list of qualifiers. I think that's how I got one of the ""no's"" so quickly. I just feel like I want to be loved. I feel so stupid. My wife also said maybe I can go to a trade school. But the only ones around me are for nursing or mechanical work neither of which I am remotely interested in. I have to get a retail job cause it's all I know even though they are meant for high school kids it's all I know. I have no talents or skills so I need work so easy monkeys can do it maybe even easier. Monkey's are smart I am not. I don't wish to die but sometimes I wonder if it'd be easier..."
depression,i feel trapped i haven’t left my house in months. i hate being awake. i have no friends and i hate myself. i have no motivation and everything is so exhausting. nothing is enjoyable anymore. what even is the point of carrying on like this. people always tell me ‘it will get better’ but i’ve been like this for years. how is this supposed to get any better? it’s only gotten worse. i don’t even get why i’m posting this. i just want to vent i guess. i just feel trapped. i can’t do anything. i’m basically just watching myself spiral deeper into depression until one day its too late.
depression,"How you deal with critismis with depression? Like the questions said how you do it for those who are getting better with their depression and self worth.
I have a hard time taking critismis since I got into my depression.

Either I cry and feel like shit. I wanna throw everything down and never touch it again.
Or I'm am angry and blame others, something else or me. I hate me for doing so poorly. I am Angry at others that their doing good and I can't because I'm stupid.
In both way I hate myself for my mistakes just the mood switches. Anger or sadness.

I just wanna take critic as a sign I have to improve and work on myself to do it better.
But I don't do anything, instead all my friends doing it and I just sitting there and hoping to get better but doing nothing beside pitting/hating myself."
depression,"Sometimes it’s just unbearable I’m sure a lot of us can relate. 

I’m pretty high functioning and have kind of learned to coexist w depression but sometimes.. somedays this weight is just too much to bear. I just want this ugly demon to quiet down so we can just coexist again."
depression,"Living life knowing you'll be gone I'll die when my parents pass away. I don't have to feel bad for not having any ambitions or plans because I know I won't be alive long enough to have a life crisis. I feel useless compared to those people I follow on social media. I feel like I've failed as a daughter for not being able to support my parents. But it's okay because it'll be over. I don't care that I've lost friends, then no one will know I've died. I only talk to my SO and parents. I feel so alone but it's okay because it'll be over. I feel bad for my SO but maybe I won't be with them by then. I try not to form connections or interact with anyone. I feel bad for the family and friends that put effort into keeping me in their lives. But it's okay because it'll be over. I'll finally stop hurting and feeling crazy all the time."
depression,"My thought process. I don't think my feelings matter at all.  I think everyone else matters. I help everyone and I give ""good"" advice but I can never seem to help myself. I always suppress it until I burst like a pipeline. I had a mental breakdown and had to leave work early about a month ago. I had to pull over because I started crying too hard. and I don't remember much from it but I watched my dashcam footage and I kept shouting ""god why can't I just be happy, I just wanna be happy."" and when I talk about me being upset I feel as if I'm annoying. and a lot of people look up to me, and I feel like if I show that sadness I will disappoint everyone and make them sad. I don't like making people worry about me. I'm not worth that. but I wanna learn to care for myself. I don't know anymore. do I even deserve to express these emotions? I don't wanna keep just breaking down every couple of months. but also being a guy I was taught growing up not to show those emotions. and which is hard for me because I am a crybaby. I get hurt so easily and feel so unheard. I just wanna feel okay and know it's okay to not be okay."
depression,"What's wrong with me? Back in 2019 I was a student in a military college, The Citadel. 
I wasn't a back knob(freshman) or anything. I was able to do what I was told, though I struggle with physical aspect, I later was able to surpass it.

The problem lies in the fact that after the first semester, I dropped out. I told everyone I was going home because of ""family problems"" and while there was some truth in it, it was mostly cover. I knew I was going home because I just couldn't handle it anymore or at least I thought I couldn't. 

I came back home and was relieved for about a month but then that when the shame and guilt started to come in. I couldn't do any of my hobbies because of how they reminded me of my failures.  I remember how much I loved playing war games or studying history but I couldnt even bare to start up my Xbox or open a book because of how bad it was. I picked up smoking even though I'm underage because I used to smoked in the military academy. I do it because although it reminds me of the shame, it kinda filled(temporarily) the void because I used to smoke cigars with my buddies there. The good old days before I fucked up everything. 

One year later, I still smoke, I can play games but not as much as I used to. I don't even know what to do with my life. Some days I feel pretty good about myself, other days I think about using the 45 to blow my brains out. I distant myself from all my friends because I just don't have the energy anymore, I'm to embarrassed with my life status of working as a janitor in the hospital, a dropout, and living with my mother to even try to find a girl. 

I guess what I'm asking advice for is, why do I feel this way? What should I do?  Why can't I put it behind me even after a year? Am I just being a little crybaby bitch? I just don't know anymore."
depression,"I won’t let him carry my burden My boyfriend who I have been friends with for fifteen years has told me repeatedly that a relationship is about two people helping each other in all things.

I told him when it comes to my depression and ptsd, but my depression especially, my dark and bitter pain, that it’s “my cross to bear”. He refuses that. He says that in a relationship, he would see me suffer knowing I can be better. Knowing through therapy I can become a better and less miserable person. If I try. If I put in effort. 

But that’s the thing. I don’t want to. I don’t care. My depression and pain, my hate and bitter misery is my whole identity. Darkness, misery, bitter pain, this is who I am. I don’t want it to go away. Because then who will I be? What happens to the void that is left after you remove that part of me? 

But that also means that my boyfriend and I can not be together long. He won’t stand by and allow me to hurt myself so he will leave. He has implied as much. It will “break” him as he says. 

Well, I am a dark and miserable bird. I know only pain and shadows. That’s who I am. I choose this. Why? Because it’s who I am now. I guess he and I will eventually break up. Sooner or later."
depression,"Is this real? Its all rainbows? Or just a treat before hell express? Before middle school ended, my classmates who I thought were my friends abused me by throwing my belongings out the window all the time, spitting and throwing water at me as I retrieved them. My friends were leaving me. Everyone was distancing. Pushing me and locking me into the classrooms locker until the teacher came. No adults would do anything about it. All I had was a shitty little radio and headphones to block it all out. I had done absolutely nothing and I swear it. Ive done no harm to anybody.  Highschool wasn't any different. Started lovely, someone hitting me with a chair and how hell began pretty much and being mocked of how much of a ""virgin"" I am. And the same thing happened until it was a routine. Beat, come home, be yelled at, isolate until next day. Beat, come home, be yelled at, isolate. Beat, cry, contemplate what I will do. The end. Slowly being eaten by all of these questions to what did I do to deserve all of this. I just wanted to learn and have a future. It made me sink to the bottom. My grades were at the edge. Each year, I ate shit at math and physics. My ADHD did not help me at all. The environment did not help me at all. I would find myself sleeping, passing out. I was called lazy but smart. Oh, how I wish it was laziness. How I wish I knew the bliss of laziness. Yet.. Somehow.. Every year I passed. Each year I knew it was time to end it because my honor was going to be trampled by repeating a year. Being labelled as a failure. I could not conceive it. But I passed. Stars aligned. I'll never know. I never will. I have no answer. I never will. Was my suffering being prolonged? Or were people secretly aware of my pain? Did they enjoy seeing me cry as they said I have an overgrown bush for hair? Seeing me mess my knuckles up by punching a wall because I couldn't take it anymore? Slamming a door into my elbow that was already hurt then comforting me and after saying I'm hopeless?

Highschool ended. Crawling but it was over. I had some room to breathe.. Or did I? My ex admitted to cheating on me. My self esteem ate a lot more shit than anything else did. But that? It ruined my perception of reality forever. I tried to get over it. I got a job. But what he told her as I confronted him.. ""Haha, you finally told him about me?"" crushed me every day. Fast forward to a May. Busy work day in the office. I gave all the love I had. I gave all my motivation. But it wasn't enough. ""I need a break"". I clinged onto my chest in the bathroom while I tried not to vomit from the panic I felt. Maybe she meant something else? Trying to focus on work? No. She had cheated again. This time, she rubbed it into my face. It was over and I looked at all the cars passing by. They had voices. Begging me. Next, work informed me I did not get the promotion that I really needed. Everyone but me were getting promotions. It was all near my birthday.. which I celebrated by myself shit faced in a dark alley late night. I had hoped I'd jump off a building that day.

All I did in life was be genuine, honest and loving. I gave everyone what they wanted, needed. The advice. I acted like a savior. It made me feel happy.. Or did it? Seemed to have ruined me only. And nobody was there to save me.

Years later.. Now I'm settled down with a beautiful woman that loves and cares the same way I do. That lived the same pain I did. 

Are you gonna take her away from me too? 

Or is it over? I am not ready. 

Please don't take her away from me too. 

It's all I have. 

Are you?"
depression,". After getting sober from hard drugs everything has been so much harder in the weirdest ways than it was before. Just empty and dumb. Its been over 2 years. I feel like i can barley write anything because what's the point? I won't even be able to get out how i really feel.  Even when i make up the words to explain, it doesn't feel right. The real words are stuck I feel so stuck inside myself. I feel like I never learned how to socialize right or get enough common knowledge because i was a drop out and then i just made myself brain dead with drugs. And i feel so fucking stupid for even writing this because whats it gonna do? I feel so guilty and embarrassed for being me. I can't even take the trash out without thinking everyone is staring at me through their windows watching. Everyone watching me as they drive by. I can barley post this because what am i even fucking writing about. What the fuck kind of brain do i have to be like this. Im so sick of being stupid. I can't even have sex anymore because it seems so pointless and embarrassing and gross. All i want is to sit and do nothing and be nothing"
depression,"My college therapist is trying to get me to go see a doctor for medication I’ve been in therapy through my college for about six months. My therapist has been helpful in getting me to think rationally, and it helps my anxiety sometimes, but it doesn’t really help my depression symptoms. The few times I’ve brought up my depression symptoms she says that I’m a good candidate for medication and says how much it would help me. (She is an LPC candidate if that matters)

I’m a little wary because I’ve heard a lot of bad things about meds and there’s a lot of backlash from the evangelical community. I would be doing this behind my parents’ backs plus I’m very sensitive to other types of medication. I just got on student health insurance which makes that harder too. 

I thought I would start by going to a PCP and getting a mental health evaluation/assessment/test and see if they think I need medication or better therapy or both. I was thinking about going to my college’s health center since it’s convenient and free to me, but I don’t know how much they can do. The other option is choosing an in-network doctor at random because I don’t have a PCP. 

TL;DR my college therapist (LPC candidate) isn’t really addressing my depression symptoms and says I need medication. I think I should go to my campus health clinic and get an evaluation but I’m not sure."
depression,"Developing a will to live Sometimes when it's darkest and stillest at night I contemplate what it means to slip into the vastness of despair. Sometimes I wonder what the point of it all is and why I shouldn't just...slip away, forever. Going softly into that good night always seems the most compelling when the silence and darkness seems so close you can almost hear it breathing. 

Drifting into the darkness would be so easy. You just float down, and down, and down, until your boundary with the depths dissipates and you are no different than the abyss. There's no form or shape to you anymore, you just diffuse into the deepest water like a drop of pigment in a glass. 

Why, though? What keeps you tethered to the present except for choice. Deciding to continue. But why. Why stay when you have lost everything, when the pain you feel runs soooo deep. Endless caverns of it are carved out of you, leaving hollow echoing inside you. Why stay, when you are only staving off the inevitable, the sinking into the darkness of the abyss, which would return you to nothingness, emptiness, end the suffering. It would erase you, but at least it would end the pain.

I have always clung to the idea of meaning as the way out. The suffering I went through had to mean something, right? It couldn't just be senseless, nonsensical violence. It had to be part of some grand plan, or design and I was determined to find that design and learn it and champion it, wresting beauty from the vile sadness and horrible things I endured. But the more I went on, the more doubt I had that things have a purpose. Maybe there isn't a grand scheme to it all. Maybe it's random, empty, chaos, just eternally hurtling toward entropy and there's no way to stop it, to leave, to change it, to understand. 

Then I look around, trying to grasp onto something and the only thing that comes to mind is that I'm not the only one suffering with darkness and despair. I see posts everyday online, things spoken of in videos, drawn in artwork expressing the pain of humankind that looks startlingly like my own if I listen or look closely. Other people are suffering too. Sometimes in the same way, sometimes not. Sometimes they're staring into the abyss too, trying to understand it just like I am. Questioning whether to stay or to go. Trying to find reasons. Trying to rationalize the infinite and what we aren't meant to understand. I feel compassion for others I see suffering.

 I wish there was some way I could help someone else or cease their pain, or at least help it make sense. Give it meaning. But I know just about as much as anyone about why things are the way they are. It's all conjecture. But I do know one thing. It's bigger than me. If other people are suffering too that means there's something bigger going on, somehow. I don't know what or why. Maybe it's just the human condition, or a product of the evolution of the human brain or body. A phenomenon of biology that makes us struggle with despair. Maybe it's the machination of an esoteric deity whose plans we aren't meant to understand, or know. Maybe it's chance, or a fluke. But it's something that has meaning, because it's bigger than just any one of us. We are all in some kind of experience together, and it means something to be here, observing it, enduring the pain and watching others do the same. It means something to exist, and to try, even though we may never know what exactly it means. 

That gives me courage to keep enduring, and to try. Because if I can be in it with more than just my own darkness, then there's a reason to stay and find out what it's all about, or at least see if there's some way to contribute to the experience of all of us, for good, for kindness, for compassion, for something greater than me."
depression,"Too sad and depressed to work properly I have a remote software dev job. Yesterday, the last quarter to half an hour of my work day, I just muted myself and sat at my desk with my head in my hands and sobbed. Today I feel like this, even just one hour in. I can't think straight. I'm so incredibly useless. How will I ever go anywhere in life if I can't even handle such an easy job like this? What happens when my boss notices?

I'm completely overloaded and stressed out. My job itself isn't even that stressful, but I can't stop zoning out and get overwhelmed by sadness. I'm just such a fucking mess. My life has been on halt for so long. This sadness and helplessness are unbearable. I want to feel alive again."
depression,"Everyone always leaves I’ve tried multiple therapists, and many other strategies except medication for my depression. I know that I should feel better after trying to talk it out, but it just never stops. The worst part is, when I truly need help and break down accidentally in front of someone I know, they always leave. I know that it must feel uncomfortable for them, but it always hurts, even though I know it’ll happen. 

What should I do to keep it to myself so I at least can have some friends? I won’t go into detail here about major causes for my depression, but I know I should feel thankful that I don’t have suicidal tendencies. I still feel like shit, and people leaving hurts the most. My own grandmother left me after telling me to shut up when I opened up to her. Sorry for ranting, it’s been so long since I’ve talked about this. I’d appreciate any advice.

Sorry for some grammar mistakes, English is not my fist language."

They will say that they never loved someone as much as they loved you or that they will love you forever, but it's simply not true and they would not hesitate to get rid of you in within 24 hours. I really love(d) them but I was nothing to them. I'm sorry, just having a sulk before I try to move on."
depression,"The comfort of meh I hate the dark, bad days. I get very anxious about good times because I know they’ll end quickly. Is the in between the best place to be when suffering from depression? I don’t like feeling lonely but when I had friends I didn’t want to lose them or scare them off. I wanted a living relationship but when I had them, I was terrified they’d end badly. I seem at my most content when I’m hiking alone thinking about things like my purpose or reason for existing. I can’t really do the normal things. I’m not interested in a career with a nice house. I don’t want to be famous or popular. I guess my role is a face in the crowd. Does anyone else find comfort in an unusual place? I say “meh” because that’s literally what I feel about life. So hiking alone on a grey day is perfect! Perfectly meh."
depression,"I am slowly becoming a failure and I want to give up I've basically become docile, Im a student in the last year of high school and my motivation to do anything has dropped, I can't do any of my work and my grades are falling fast, I've become numb to negative emotions, I failed a few tests and I got a rejected offer from a university, That kinda stuff would have made me incredibly sad just a few months ago but now I didn't feel anything.

I want to give up, I can not live up to my own expectations, I can't do the work to meet them, I just feel lazy, every time I open up some work I sit there and I cant do it, and sometimes i just cry

I've lost hope and I want to give up, anyone have an idea on how to become productive again"
depression,"✌️ Being a single child and losing parents and selfish girlfriend who doesn't even care If something happens to me pushing me into depression i feel like I need to share my feelings and thoughts with someone but no is there to listen I tried talking with friends but everyone are like money minded they just need to booze and enjoy not even understanding what I'm trying to say. Many negetive thoughts going on my mind, without Mom and Dad life is never goes easy!"
depression,"I think I know where this is going Though I know don’t want to kill myself right now, I look at it as a viable way out if life keeps heading this direction. You see, lately, it feels like everything’s gotten worse. Because of depression and various other reasons, I can’t manage to fix these problems. Consequentially, new problems constantly arise. It feels like this pile of problems grows exponentially. One after another they pile on top of each other, with the next one seemingly coming faster than the last one. It feels like someone’s digging me a hole in quicksand, and they’re upping the tempo of the shovel. I’m scared that I’ll soon reach a point where the depth of this hole grows so fast that I can’t dig myself out, no matter how much I try to save myself. I’m scared that perhaps I’m already there and it’s just a matter of time until I realize it and give up. Honestly it seems like it because I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore to help with this shit"
depression,"Really bored, going insane? I’m F14, I’m diagnosed with MDD, it’s literally the worst. Every time I talk to someone I literally have to put up this fake happy persona and I’m sick of it. I’m scared that one day, that mask will fall off and they will see the real me. I’ve also been super bored and I’ve tried pretty much everything but I just can’t, I really can’t. I don’t know if this will ever get better."
depression,"Video games are my reason to live I have no dreams or aspirations. I’m a disappointment to my parents and I have zero friends. I have no talents or skills, I’m simply a waste of space. There is nothing good about me. 

What keeps me going are video games. I know it sounds sad as fuck and stupid, but it’s the truth. 
Whenever I think I’ve had enough, I think about upcoming games that I look forward to playing and they help.

Lately though, I’ve lost a bit of interest in playing. Sometimes it feels like a chore to play. Fuck, there are days when I can’t even get up from my bed. I fear that one day, not even video games will be able to save me. I fear the day that I stop wanting to play and instead finally get the courage to kill myself."
depression,"I’m Unhappy Without Her… My girlfriend broke up with me recently (about 3 weeks ago) and I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore, I barely enjoy stuff and end up crying myself to sleep on some nights. The reason she broke up with me was because I found out she was messaging her ex (I didn’t have a problem with that at all) then he told me that she was telling him “inappropriate” things let’s just say, so I confronted her about it. She has really bad depression so I should’ve approached the situation differently but I was too upset to use my brain and she ended up having a panic attack since she thought I was going to break up with her, I decided to stay with her and I told her in the end. Less than a week later she breaks up with me saying what happened “there her back”. 

We’re still in contact and I’m trying to get over her but it’s difficult when she says stuff to me like “I love you” or “you mean everything to me” when we’ve broken up, she even started harming herself apparently over me the other day too. 

This isn’t the only reason as to why I feel like this but definitely the main one, I just miss her so much even though I know it’s best to get over her."
depression,"tired, really tired it sounds cheesy af but i feel as if light was taken out of my eyes three years ago. that sparkle in my eyes of excitement, motivation and happiness is gone. i feel like a zombie. its my school's holidays right now and all i have done so far is eat a lot, watch tv and sleep. i have a project due when i return to school, which is in 4 days. my classmates have all completed it while ive done nothing. my dad said to me today that he is angry at me because i havent done anything. i understand. i am also angry at myself. i cant find that energy i had 3 years ago to do anything. its even a struggle for me to leave the house. im just really tired everyday. is anyone in the same situation?"
depression,"I just cried for the first time since 2019 I have had depression since I was 12 And hadn’t been able to cry since December 2019, I had been struggling to get myself to cry for about two years. I tried several things in an attempt to get some sort of emotional release but nothing worked. 

I started to burn my arms in an attempt to get myself to feel something. I did several bad things just to feel anything 

And about 5 mins ago I started crying. I have no idea why but I feel a lot better"
depression,"I have no herd My whole life i have never fit in. Just to relate to the average person I have to put in so much work. Even in college I couldn't fit in with my peers. Girls never liked me. Either I just be a camelian and feel empty inside, or I can be myself and be alone. People also love to single me out and judge me. I am tired of it. I even feel like I don't even belong in my family. I think there is no hope for anything to get better."
depression,"Feeling like a worthless parasite I know im not supposed to feel this way. But just feel like staying in my bed forever n not waking up. Feel bad for my husband that works everyday. I don’t even want to get out of the house except for grocery shopping. still cook for us everyday and clean up here and there trying to be a better housewife since im unemployed. i feel guilty from just eating as much as i used to or when i think i need to buy sth.. i feel like i would rather just disappear then i wont have to be a parasite. Trying to motivate myself to do the stuff i used to enjoy doing, but its just not working.."
depression,"Tired of living. These few days, if not weeks have been really hard for me, emotionally. Most of the time, I feel melancholic and tired. It's only when I put on a movie or play video games where I feel like I have escaped this sad reality. 

Sometimes I like to think of my life as a movie and that there are a group of people watching it on a big screen. It feels awful, when I don't experience the feeling of having a group of friends I can count on. A group of friends who will listen to my problems and actually invite me to join them in fun activities. I feel so alone. Even in a class with 20 people, I feel lonely. I thought that 2020 would be the year to turn this all around and make new friends, be more sociable. But, the pandemic hit and now I don't know what to do. 

Sorry if this is sounding like selfpity but I feel that people today are more disconnected than ever. Maybe I'm speaking from experience but it seems that making meaningful connections with others is really hard. Also, the media is really making me depressed. All I see is the world going into shit, with so many people dying, so many healthcare workers being treated like trash and scummy politicians getting away with their actions and even more gut wrenching news. Its making me lose faith in being alive and on this earth. 

Maybe I need therapy. Maybe I need help. Maybe being dead is better than living because I won't have to feel these painful emotions."
depression,"Im so heartbroken There was a guy on whom I had a crush on from mutual friend group. He tried to pressure me into having sex with him when i was on drugs he gave me. We only kissed. I told him i was a virgin, but he still tried to manipulate me with his words to have sex with him. After i repeatedly said no, he told me that having sex with a virgin is gross anyway because of blood and everything. Then he turned on some degrading porn on his computer and i left. I was so shocked by this because before all that i thought of him as a sweet, gentle guy. He then pursued my friend of 4 years and dated her for a while. She dated him even though she knew i had crush on him and that he tried to use me. She said to me that he was grossed and embarassed that he made out with me and it was all because of the drugs. She was having a party and this guy forbid her from inviting me. He tried to shift blame on me, like it was all my fault. She dumped him eventually but  by that time I already  cut off ties with her. Now hes having another gf who thinks hes the sweetest guy ever, and everybody is so smitten with their relationship. Its so fucking gross. Im so grossed out by people. What did i do to deserve this??? I will never heal from this. I feel so betrayed and humiliated. Justice and karma doesnt exist. Guys can use women like dirt and it is justified in their minds because theyre not the women they actually want for something meaningful. No matter if these women are kind, loving, valuable etc. Its so gross. Im glad i didnt sleep with him but im still deeply traumatized"
depression,I wanna die but I wanna be alive. I’ve been so lonely and never felt this bad before. I can’t even cry anymore and I feel numb to all emotions. The only thing that keeps me alive is my parents. They have checked in on me but I honestly just want to happy.
depression,"Could anyone with experience with SNRIs please offer some advice? Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask this question. I have anxiety (to the point where I don’t do anything because I’m too worried something won’t go right), general depression (extreme apathy and all but absent motivation) and ADHD. I thought Wellbutrin would be a good fit for me but the doctor I talked to said that it would be a bad choice with the anxiety since I said that was the worst of the three things (though they’re all quite bad). 

He gave me venlafaxine and I stupidly didn’t look into how rough it is to start and stop it. I feel as wired as I do when I take adderall with the added downside of a tight chest and weird breathing. I’m going to make an appointment tomorrow to see if maybe there’s something a bit better to take (I’m only 2 days in) as I ultimately don’t want to be on this for more than a year and with prior experience with serotonin withdrawal I would like to avoid something that seems so infamously known to be harsh. So this brings me to my question:

Are there any SNRIs that are less harsh to start/stop than Venlafaxine? Also, are SNRIs better to take in the morning so you don’t get wired when trying to sleep or is that exclusive to Venlafaxine?

Thanks"
depression,Confused and tired It’s so weird I’ve had this feeling since I was a boy the unwillingness to try anything. My will to try stuff died around middle school and now as an adult man I hate my life so much. I’m physically tired as well. I’m in my early 20s and I haven’t done anything with my life. I don’t want to die because imma miss out on stuff but I don’t feel like doing anything . It’s not just laziness it’s overwhelming sadness and doomed attitude . Anything I try I feel doomed . Now with a recent break up I got a bit motivated to change my life but now it’s back falling apart . I wish I could afford help
depression,"I hate that feeling I don’t know what to type. I just feel so horrible and I can never sleep. I feel like Ive lost part of my heart and I can’t get it back. I wish I could sleep forever and dream of when we were happy. If I could hold her again, lay next to her. Everything was alright
I made a mistake. 
Alone I feel that you will forget me. Please don’t go. I am surrounded by orchids. I’m fine."
depression,"Things Aren’t the same I used to love going to theme parks I enjoyed classes and had lots of friends although I have kept my friends and grown even closer to them at school I was given  a test called AS tracking when the results where in I was immediately approached as my results where “interesting” apparently I have real self disclosure problems  and I don’t tell people things so I think this could help.
My grades have gone down a fair bit especially maps im constantly tired can’t motivate myself to revise, exercise do homework and all I seem to do is watch YouTube play games and eat food. I still get some work done but I sometimes don’t even want to play a game or aren’t enjoying it but I play it just to pass time.
I don’t enjoy things the same way I did even after online school I’m always tired of putting up a happy face and seeming sociable at school and always crash afterwards my parents keep saying it’s because I don’t exercise enough and I want to but when I do nothing fucking changes I ain’t losing the weight I have. Worst of all I’m struggling in maths class and my teacher tells EVERYONE and I’m in the top class so it’s competitive and although I don’t think they’re that mean I feel like my classmates are looking down on me.
Anyway, I’m ranting what I wanted was to say was that everything feels like a weaker version of what it was a thrill would turn into something to pass the time my favourite film into a two hour escape. I’m tired and lazy and I’m just not happy I don’t know if I’m depressed I don’t know if I want to die i don’t know anything I don’t want to say I have depression and be an embarrassment if I don’t . I don’t want to be seen as weak and I don’t want to bring others down. You don’t have to upvote or comment anything. And tbh I’ll probably feel bad for wasting ppls time if u got this far into the post. Don’t worry too much about this post. I’m just trying to practise my self disclosure problems and using this as a site to vent because I’d rather vent to internet strangers instead of to people who just tell me to exercise or have a positive mindset, or friends who I’ll feel bad about wasting time. So In short Dw about this post keep scrolling Redditor!
Have a good one"
depression,"My rabbit I found an app where you can raise a rabbit. All you have to do is feed and clean it daily. 

Honestly it’s a great reminder to me when I’m going through my dark phases. I get a reminder on my phone and this little weird bunny reminds me to check in and it helps to recenter my focus.

depression,"I constantly think about killing myself, but the only thing stopping me is the thought of my boyfriend having to cope with my death I can’t imagine losing him, and I don’t want to put that burden on him, I can only imagine the pain he’d go through. Therapy isn’t helping, I feel so... lifeless."
depression,"I get in these small depressive episodes where I feel worthless... I’ve been on new medication for about a week now and it seems to be helping with my mood. Yet sometimes throughout the day, I get in this small depressive episodes where I feel completely worthless because my ex-boyfriend was a heroin addict and ghosted me in the hospital after three years being together. Most of the times I look past it and think of what a piece of shit he was but then sometimes I can’t help but become sad and depressed and think as to why he couldn’t be with me?  Why did he have to ghost me in the hospital after becoming paralyzed? Why can’t he just get clean? Why didnt he stay by my side when I stood by his side when he went to rehab, trying to help him get clean? Why?"
depression,"I never told anyone, because they would forever look at me differently People probably notice, they are not blind, but I never ever spoke to my family or friends about what was going on. I'm not so deep in depression as I once was, it's more like always in the back of my mind now, but I still strongly remember how I was terrified of admitting anything, as in my eyes they would forever judge or look at me differently. Even if I ever got better. 

Every choice I made would forever be connected to my sickness, and they would always wonder if it was ""the real me"" or the sickness talking/acting. Well guess what, this is the real me, it's always been. With depression and everything. 

Do you feel the same, or regret telling your family or friends how you really feel? Or is it really best to be honest with people around you?"

depression,"No motivation to even take a bath.  I have no motivation at all. I don't have the motivation to get out of bed some days, and beg my brain to go back to sleep so I can continue some stupid dream I was having.

I haven't showered in weeks. I just brush my teeth, sit in front of my computer and waste the day. I have exams I should be studying for that will decide my future but all that I do is sit and waste away my potential. Not to brag but I'm really smart. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself.

I have desperate and pathetic dreams where I'm holding hands with a girl or resting my head on her shoulder. This quarantine has fucking ruined my life. I don't know how to get motivated again."

I can be surrounded by people that love/care for me but I still feel so crushingly alone. 
I work third shift and it's the worse, I'm OK during the day, but the long nights when I have no one to talk to... got me smashing my self-confidence into absolute zero.

depression,"Covid has messed me up and I dont know how to recover I'm an 18(F) and I got covid in early December. I was bedridden for 3 weeks and in and out of emerge. My boyfriend got it 2 days after me and he only got a runny nose and loss of smell. I had every symptom except for 3 and thats because they were specific for certain ages. It took me 24 days to get over covid and there were days I spent crying at night afraid I was going to die (before I knew it had it). But now its finally over and its been a 2ish weeks since then, I still don't have my sense of smell which I can accept. But now I can't do any small activities, I can't even roll over in bed without my heart rate picking up and it being almost impossible to breathe. I'm worried its going to be like this for the rest of my life. I feel useless. I've always been a really active person so not being able to even walk a kilometer is killing me inside. Not only that I screwed over so many people when I tested positive (as it was exam time) and my roommate treated me like shit (didnt want me leaving the room besides to use the washroom and didn't want me cooking in the kitchen) so I dont even know if I want to return to my place or not

I just feel like it's ruined my life and I dont know if it'll ever go back to normal"
depression,I got a squishy toy and it's helped my mood?? So I'm a grown adult and I went to the dollar store and got myself a little squishy seal toy. And some moon sad to play with when I'm sad.

depression,"I kind of just got sad out of nowhere (rant) today I started listening to music I use to listen to with my friends back in 2018, I got a weird sorta nostalgic feeling come over me. It’s leaving me in tears and I’m not sure exactly how to feel right now. I miss my friends. I miss parties and all the love and warmth I felt from the people in my life. I’m not sure if it’s just me but everything feels the same every single day. Nothing ever changes and I feel like life’s just grey. The best example I can give is like an LED light that use to flash many colours but got stuck on one that won’t change. I’m hurting really bad right now and I can’t even explain it."
depression,"Am I an asshole for confronting a suicidal person? (I’ve been there and I still have suicidal thoughts, I know how all that shit goes.)

this one guy who I’m kind of friends with, he’s been texting me stuff like “heyy how are you I hope you’re well” and asking me stuff and before I can say anything, he starts venting to me or ranting about all his life stuff. I usually don’t mind when people do that, I love to be there for people,

But I realized that I was being used by him cause he only ever texts me when something is wrong, today he did the same and I finally confronted him, after I NICELY explained him what he’s doing he started saying stuff like “please don’t confront me I’m way too suicidal now” I felt so fucking bad for even saying anything but I felt like it was needed. After he said that thing, I told him to reach out to his friends I know that he’s got at least 5 of them and we are in a groupchat together, I also said that just because he’s used me doesn’t mean he can’t change the way he acts and doesn’t mean he deserves death or anything, to reassure him a little at least.

But in the back of my head I still feel so guilty for what I did. I’m scared to leave him but I’m also scared for myself because I’m struggling so bad right now and I can’t take this much"
depression,"I can't eat nor sleep, I'm always tired and depressed and more than anything disappointed in myself Thank you for taking the time to read this. even having the want to talk about this is surprisingly odd of me to do in these times.

Let me start just summarizing how I got to where I am. My parents immigrated to the U.S.A in 2009 and brought me along with them so yes I'm for one undocumented. I went through all of middle and most of high school really just being no one up until my Junior year when I joined a Robotics club, soon I met my mentor whom I still stay in touch with, who just completely changed my life, my parents had no real care for what I did with my future, even less if I graduated high school or not. He took me in his team and soon I became the president of such club and continued on as a mentor for a few years. I graduated with a certificate in Computer Aided Drafting and another as an IT. I landed a job as a computer tech at a good company and continued on to a local community college (my first two years of high school were horrible as far as grades go so a university wasn't a choice). At this point of my life I felt like the world was at my finger tips, while all other graduates went to live paycheck by paycheck I was making enough to make a living, go to school, and have personal life.

But now everything has changed, I lost my good job and my current job is at a local computer repair shop in which I average 11 bucks an hour. I lost the want and the financial possibility of continuing to mentor for my old robotics team. I'm one semester away from getting an Associates of Science in Electrical Engineering, and I'm beginning to realize I can't afford to attend a university for my Bachelor's. I can't get a better job because my options are very limited, again I'm undocumented and landing that first job was just extremely lucky for me. I have hit a wall.

After trying for the longest to make something out of myself I have given up. I've been rejected at so many jobs because of my status. I'm beginning to feel like the reason I lost my job is because I've never been able to stand up for myself. I'm just naturally a nice person and when I get into conflict with people I always take the blame to avoid making them upset. I have lost the want to do absolutely anything. It has affected me physically, I can't eat. I can't sleep, I'm always tired and in some ways angry at the world. My girlfriend doesn't see the guy she did a few years ago and although she is very supportive she doesn't understand what I'm going through. I no longer feel good enough for her. I can't seek professional help, because of my status I am ineligible for health care. My family is very old school so they just tell me to man up when I try to open up. At this point my anxiety is out of control, I can't get into a little conflict with someone without feeling like it consumes me completely. I have very little friends, I feel extremely lonely. I'm just desperate to make this feeling stop."
depression,"I live inside a prison basically Where i live everytime i go downstairs theyre observating me, theyre guessing my emotional state, its like a fcking prison."
depression,it seems like everyone suddenly started ignoring me and i don't understand whyyy. am i fucking invisible or just don't matter to anyone anymore?  or am i annoying and no one cares to talk to me
depression,"Why is living better than dying? I'm finding it really difficult to go through my days. I have no anxiety, my mind is blank. All I think about is dying and ending my suffering. I can't look past these negative thoughts. All answers seem to be futile once I give my life up. Everything seems meaningless. I want to find hope, but also, I know that hope isn't the answer. And if it is, idk how to accept it. 
I feel dead. Sometimes I think I'm just lazy and that's why I make myself feel suicidal. It's like, I can't do all the worldly things, so I find a way to escape it by feeling sad. Idk."
depression,"First time feeling something in a long time and I wish it wasn't rage. For the longest time I haven't felt like I could truly feel emotions for an extended period of time except for indifference or utter dispare. I hoped to feel like I could find a moment in life where I could begin to generally feel happiness and yet all I feel now is rage.

I can't say I have ever felt patriotism for the US because of how we carry ourselves in general. I can be happy that our desire is for everyone can find happiness and freedom from oppression but I refuse to think that we are free from hypocrisy. We have done wrong and we need to become better. But today all I feel is rage and hatred from the audacity of conspiracy theorists, racists, deaf to reason, blind to logic, and a distinct lack of common sense.

I feel like a monster that I once was able to cage has broken free. I want the death of Trump and his enablers and nothing but that will satisfy the rage. Death to those who perpetuated the lies and misinformation in the media. Death to those who dare call themselves patriots and peaceful protesters. I have never been so full of rage that I fear for others lives from me. I own no firearms, I have no special training, but having thought of many ways to kill myself throughout my life (to much of a coward to go through with it and blessed with an undying hope for a better future) I have learned of many ways of killing a person rather quickly and effectively.

I want to let it go but I can't. I'm tired of feeling like a joke to the world because of a orange fascist that continues to get away with treasonous actions and we are either too proud or to much of a pussy to put an end to it. I want to let go of this hate 😭"
depression,"Suicide thoughts overwhelm me Hi there, thanks to anyone willing to listen to me, I'm 24, I have been unemployed for almost a year now and I really can't handle life anymore. Although I really worked hard on it got a masters degree, I am living with my boyfriend, I am a pretty hot girl, I speak 5 languages but really all this hard work for nothing... 

I come for a poor country where I lived through many traumas (rape, sexual harrasment, abandonment, terrorism) and I've been living in Europe for 10 years now, I do have my mother and my brother with me here but we're all really depressed (my brother and my mom are on Prozac and I'm on Lexapro), let's say life in a germanic country isn't so easy, I have troubles making friends, finding a job, or even just being myself here is really tough.
Whats even harder is to see my boyfriend who is an American cis man getting everything he wants without any effort, he got hired at the first job he applied for, everyone is interested in him and all the friends we have are his friends so I really don't feel like they care a single bit about me, I'm always ""the girlfriend of"" 
To be honest, really I don't feel like anyone cares about me, I don't have anymore connections to my country of origin, I feel like shit in the country I am in, my mother says she's sick of me, my brother never even calls me to ask how I am.. I am not interested in anything anymore, can't read, can't study, can't even paint anymore I tried for a year to feel better but now I am really thinking about death.

I can't leave this country for another as I have to live here 2 more years to get a passport otherwise I risk coming back to my original country and I have nothing there.. 
My boyfriend said he would marry me to help me get a new passport but I feel like that goes against all my beliefs and values. 

I see no future or present happiness, for now I am still surviving but my everyday life is annoying, my boyfriend just wants me to baby him, all he does with me is have sex... I cook and clean the house, and that's it. 

I literally have no money to my name, I barely make it to the end of the month by paying rend and food.. I see no way out of my situation"
depression,I dont know what to do I dont enjoy anything anymore I just play video games to distract myself from how I feel and every time i try something new or productive it ends in failure which makes me feel useless. On top of this I dont want to tell my Family because I'm scared how they will react and I presume they will try to make decisions for me and that it wont help. I'm laying in bed right now after trying and failing to go to sleep at a reasonable hour and I dont know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like crying but I dont have anything to blame but myself I dont understand how people do anything when everything is so hard for me. I'm hopeless and just wanna be happy but I dont know what I need to do.
depression,"Is depression redundant ? Hi folks

I've been struggling with depression for 19 years due to different reasons. On top of all were health problems, anxiety, everyday arguments with my family, being rejected by girls countless times without ever success. After high school I've attended university, but left 6 months later because I couldn't focus on studying and the disease I was suffering from reached the top. I've acknowledged that a life change was necessary, so I've moved to another country, learned a new language and got a satisfying job. The first day I moved in uk I felt like I was living another man's life, it was such a dream being able to do the fuck I wanted to, without being anxious abouth anything and anyone. My disease ceased to exist almost, to the point I could forget I'd ever had it. I was good at my job, had chance to make career and at work I was respected from colleagues and superiors. Had wonderful times there, so many good memories with friends and girlfriends. I kept myself fit by going to the gym, doing sports. Started to play guitar everyday and even if I haven't become a master, enjoyed it a lot. I was feeling attractive, interesting, successful, like I could climb a mountain and lift it if I wanted to do. After 3 years I've decided that I wanted to go back to university, since it represented a thing I didn't succeed in my life. I wanted to show to myself I could do it. But I needed some money for it, so took the decision to get into a cruise ship, earn 30k in a year and finance my studies. I had a clear plan. Then covid fucking came in just 2 months after I've sailed. I've been stuck in a 2x2 ship cabin for 6 months, eating shit food, without internet connection, somewhere between Miami and Bahamas, waiting to be repatriated. Nightmare, like a prisoner. In July came back home, tried to get my job back in UK, but failed because of covid and probably won't get it before 2022. Summer has been dreadful, desperately looking for another job and doomed by the idea to spread covid to my family. Later on I've taken the decision to study in my home country since it's cheaper and I can afford it. But now I'm living again with my parents and my brother, sharing a little space in 4, without my wage, stuck 24/7, no chance to go out, got chubby again, absolutely no way to get a job in the place I am, but I said to myself it was fine, it was just matter of time before getting a degree and start to work again. In the first 3 months I was doing great, studying constantly and with much interest. Now situation has become unbearable. My father is doing smartworking, my brother is a complete asshole doesn't want to share our room, my mother keeps home tidy and I literally have no place where to study in peace. Fucking neighbours scream all the day and it's never quiet here. Is it normal that to do my duties I have to fight that much ? I'm just pretending a place where to do my readings but I can't have it. Now my head is full of negative thoughts, can't focus because of them and my mind is literally shooting me with good memories and nostalgia. I don't see myself at the mirror from months because I'm looking shit, eating is literally the only pleasure I get. Not doing sports is consuming me, and don't tell me I can do squats and launges in my living space, because that doesn't help. I just can't help but think to all the things I've lost without any reason, I didn't deserve that, I've done nothing wrong to lose my job and my dignity. I had a life, a beautiful one. Now I find myself again exactly how I was 4 years before."
depression,Tbh I wanna die I’m doing fine. I have good grades and I have a reliable friend. I have no real trauma and yet I want to die. I don’t want it to be painful but I find myself hoping that when I cross the street a car will hit me. Honestly if there was a way it could happen with no pain I’d be gone already. I’m only 15 and like I said I don’t have a bad life so I don’t understand. I smile and feel good when I’m with friends but I still want to leave.
depression,"Idk I truly hate my mom. Honestly I think she’s the source of most of my problems. My mom and my dad fight so often. It used to scare me so much when she got mad that I’d get stomach aches and throw up sometimes. My dad would defend me and my siblings but she would never really listen. They’ve recently been getting worse and keep changing their mind about separating. At first I cried, and I don’t know why I cared that much I had been wishing for this to happen since I was 5. But now I just wish me and my brother could move away with my dad. I wish I wouldn’t have to see her again. Sometimes there are moments when I laugh with her but then she does something or says something like she always does. The worst part is that I know if she died I wouldn’t feel anything. That’s how I feel about everyone. I have some friends that mean a lot to me but I know if something were to happen to them I wouldn’t feel much. When people go away I don’t miss them. Whether it’s friends or family I don’t seem to care what happens to them. It’s not that I don’t care about them or that they don’t mean anything to me, it’s just that for some reason I don’t care when they’re gone. I don’t understand why I’m like this. I can’t tell my dad because i don’t think he’d understand if I myself can barely explain it. If I told him , “hey I love you and all but I wouldn’t care if you were to disappear.”"
depression,"I feel so left out... Will someone ever love me? Hi everyone.

I'm a really introverted and kind of insecure guy, and often feel like nobody likes/wants me, I just don't get it why I can't seem to get a girlfriend. I tried self reflecting but I just can't seem to find what is wrong with me, and why it is the way it is... Maybe I'm depressed but I don't know either. I do know that over time I subconsciously built a mindset of being defensive/hating people who I feel like hate me. I also know that whenever I get contact with a girl (once every 2 years or so), I get desperate and clingy and fuck it all up... I just don't know what the difference is between other people easily getting on with other people, and I'm just here lonely feeling like a loser.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I have a profile picture to see what I look like. Look at it and realise I still haven't kissed a girl... what is wrong with me..."
depression,"How do I know when someone cares? I almost always feel like noone cares about me and that im burdening everyone around me.

I really like helping people but have recently been asking for help. But I hate myself for doing that. I should be strong enough for make it on my own.

I had a friend who I asked for help every day for many months. I found out from someone else I was worsening her mental health. I apologised and now she barely speaks to me. She never reaches out. Only briefly responds to some messages and I feel like I lost her. This has only gotten worse since I made an attempt on my life. I'm sure she blames herself.

I barely talk to anyone anymore. People say they care but noone really reaches out to me. I could not text anyone for a week and I probably wouldn't have anyone notice.

I know it's really hard for me to see that people care but. If they don't want to spend time with me maybe they don't?"
depression,"HELP i don’t know what to do anymore. i’ve been so scared to talk to anyone about what’s been going on for a long time. i find that talking about what goes on in my life is embarrassing and cringe to others and i don’t want to sound like i don’t know what km talking about. Also bc of the fact that i don’t really have many people to talk to about. my 2 best friends hang out more without me and whenever i’m there, it’s like i’m not. i feel as though i’m a backup friend. or a friend they can’t get rid of. 
my family’s just gotten really bad to the point i don’t really talk to my brothers unless their ringing me to get through to mum or when they do come around they ask me for smokes or a cone. it’s the only way i get to talk to them. yet i can’t really talk to them anyway.
My step-dad is a hoarder and i feel like i’m suffocating living in this house. he also drinks his wonderful a lot and then proceeds to get angry. never throws hands but verbally. He is condescending and snaps at everything. especially my mum. He also has said to us he is going to fix everything up but it’s gotten to the point where i just know he’s lying. he has been sick and has got a operation coming up but even before he was sick. i have offered to hire people or to do it myself (cleaning ofc) but even if he had $3m he still wouldn’t. i know that hoarding is a mental illness but i feel as though it’s borderline selfish. 
My mum is so depressed as well as my sister. most of us have drifted away from our friends because and i feel horrible saying this but we’re embarrassed. i know i sound horrible and materialistic but i didn’t grow up in the nicest house but it was home. my mum hasn’t had the best run in life. dad left when i was a baby for good reasons. i just can’t understand why it won’t work out for us. 
i feel stuck, trapped inside my own mind. whenever i go out it’s like i’m not fully there. when i’m at work i can hardly focus because my mind is where it’s at. 
i’m so tired. i hardly have any friends, never really have since year 7.
i’ve been depressed since then, i have the worst anxiety and i just want to die. 
i feel so ugly and unlovable. People badge said to me that i’m really pretty but i don’t see it nor will i ever. i’m hyper insecure and just feel like it’s never going to end. i also have the inability little to talk with any man and will probably die alone if not now."
depression,I have a severe asthma attack today. I still am having a difficulty in breathing. I wanna tell mom and dad to take me to the hospital since inhalers and nebulizers won't really help me anymore but I'm just really scared of hospital bills honestly. I better endure it like always but it's just difficult especially when I can't lie down and sleep.
depression,"Why can’t I feel happy? I have no reason to be unhappy I’m sorry I’ve held off posting here as I think a lot of people have it worse. I’m not suicidal or bed ridden, I can just about function through a day and keep my job. I should be happy, I have a job, a flat, a boyfriend, stability. But I can’t seem to feel any happiness, I can pretend I am, but it’s not there. All I can feel is nothing, anxiety and I’m just tired all the time. Like my flat is a mess and I have no clean stuff because after my working day I just can’t bring myself to do anything. 

Not really sure how to resolve this situation, but just wondering if anyone has any advice."
depression,"I’m just sad for simply existing. I have been suffering from depression for about 5 years now. In this year, a friend suggested that I should take remeron from my psychiatrist and it worked gradually as I had the strength to get out of bed.

Now I need to find a job. I am lost, discouraged with what I do not have and depressed of what have might been. I could not see clearly ahead of what would be a dream job simply because I lost hope that I can be happy in the future. 

The thought of being happy was too distant. I dropped out of law school after the first year where my results were a+. Great now what. 

Right now I feel like a disappointment- I dare not put my linked in profile online for the gap years I have taken. 

I tried doing all the psychometric tests and I am in a dead block. 

I can’t help but feeling like an enormous failure when it comes to my career. 

Right now, I’m venting my anger through swimming and some form of exercise to wipe the fog of my eyes. 

F**** I am really messed up."
depression,Math is draining me Im at uni and I just cant cope with the math course I must pass. It maked me so anxious and sad I cant get out of bed. I just cant do that shit. Other subjects are fine I guess but that math is just....so hard. Any advice?
depression,How do people justify living? Why have we not just killed ourselves yet? I for one hate myself with every fibre of my being. I have completely destroyed my day. I am a useless human being and I hate living. Life is a complete waste of fucking time. I should have killed myself decades ago.
depression,"I don’t know what to do anymore... Could only write this pissed drunk and high on speed. 
I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m not a good person; I have no friends, no family, nobody that loves me (or even likes me for that matter), nobody that wants to talk to me, no job, no money, no hobbies, nothing. I am nothing. 
I’ve attempted suicide 3 times (at age 16, 17, and 18, respectively), seems like I can’t even do that right (I don’t want to now so don’t report me please). I am utterly lost. 
I was diagnosed with conduct disorder at the age of 9 for multiple instances of violence (one of which led to me being expelled from 7th grade, and another-years later-leading to me being expelled from my senior year of high school, with a police escort I might add), and after turning 18- therefore a legal adult- was officially diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (accompanied with severe paranoia akin to schizophrenia; however, I have not been officially diagnosed with schizophrenia despite having recurring, vivid hallucinations). I have never felt close to anyone. I am completely devoid of pleasure; no drug in the world be it illicit (m***, weed, alcohol, h*****, c******), or those which are prescribed to me (risperidone, haloperidol, clozapine, and formerly fluoxetine)- make me feel any different. I haven’t felt “happy” - let alone normal- since I was 7-8 years old. My father was a schizophrenic heroin addict. He burned me with cigarettes and beat me senseless nearly every day until he died (when I 12). My mother did nothing but encourage his actions and partake in similar substances.
Everyday I wake up and feel absolutely nothing at all. The only discernible emotions I experience  throughout the course of a day are anger and frustration. 
I can no longer afford psychiatric treatment (due to the fact that I cannot keep a job). And things are starting to get very scary.
I am unable to sleep, usually staying awake for approximately 2-3 nights at a time before being able to sleep for a measly few hours in the afternoon. 
I don’t know what to do. I lack all of the skills necessary to be a functioning human being. Rarely eating or sleeping, I feel like I’m starving myself sometimes- I’ve lost nearly 30 lbs since October. 
Even though I am fully aware of all of these things, I don’t know what to do or how to fix them. 
It was very, very hard for me to write this, so if you read all of it- thank you."
depression,"I dont know why I keep thinking this.... The main thing I miss about a relationship isn't the sex not gifts we gave eachother but the love, the going to bed next to your loved one of three years who you are trying for a kid with and knowing you are loved"
depression,"I feel like I'm done I don't even know where to start. But this is a letter to myself and like everything else I share online, I know no one will care, much less some well-intentioned, kind, sad strangers online. I only ask that you understand this side of me and allow me this space... Is that a fair request from a fellow sad one?  


I have a decent life, and so many things to feel grateful for. And I really, really am. I don't want my words or feelings to diminish the gratitude that is in my heart, though I know appearances matter more than people admit. 

So I feel some guilt, or otherwise some apprehension for feeling this way, but I also know I have a severe case of an illness with no cure yet... and I try to let go, not blame myself, not give myself a hard time.

Days like today I just feel like going to the nearby woods with a gun, drink up, toke up, get blasted out of my mind, and blow my goddamn brains out behind some bush, where my corpse won't be disturbed but by nature, coming to reclaim my flesh vehicle back into nutrients, as the cycle should flow. 

From a simplistic point of view, I know I'm loved by many people. I have many close friends, a tight family, I matter to a lot of people.   
But also, for all the years I've spent with me, I feel like they don't really see me. Almost no one has seen me deeply, known the most intimate parts of me. We're not on the same wavelength. It's not a communication issue. They just live their own lives, they have other worldly concerns. I wouldn't want to burden them with things from my fucking ego anyway. 

But also, as I grew up as an illusioned kid, no matter how ugly the world was, I had some certainty that one day I would realize these parts of myself. And now as an adult, I see very firmly that the world isn't all that I wanted it to be. I've spent long years looking for something with no success. 

To give context, I've had a good year. For all the fucked up things going on in the world, I've made great strides in Myself this year, correcting behaviors, growing, business-wise, regarding my esoteric spiritual path, worked on my self-esteem, and a long et cetera. I'm in a good place! Even outside my inner world, I've done good things for my life and those around me. This all following a year-long depression that nearly killed me, that got me fat, in perilous health, that killed my businesses, that strained some of my relationships, that saw me self-isolate to the point of an ""intervention"" by my friends (love them all). But that's the type of depression that can easily follow a sustained period of crisis, years of allowing yourself zero respite, fully engaged in survival mode, for my family, for the most powerful driving force, to carry one's family above water whatever the cost. 

That, too, is a source of guilt, being suicidal and family, and all that. But allow me to spare myself opening that can of worms, I've got enough on my plate as it is for now. The fact I can allow these feelings to overcome me is progress enough for me at the moment. 

So after my life fell apart a few times in the span of a few years, I was doing well. But today everything got to me. 

I could blame the brain injury I was born with, but I know that it's barely a factor. I could blame my trauma, or certain attributes. But I know at least some of it's just something in my psyche, something unreachable yet palpable, that is always there (and will be for the rest of this incarnation), sometimes nagging at me and sometimes sleeping, it would seem, in certain stealth to make an appearance.

But the worst part is knowing that I'm truly alone. That I'm segregated. That I don't relate to the rest, and the rest don't relate to me, even though by all appearances we're all just people. It's like my tie to the Collective Unconscious is severed and I don't know if there's a way to reconnect. Like a stagnant droplet that won't freeze nor evaporate to find a way back to the ocean. Trapped. Ensnared. 

I wish I could connect and be a bit more like others, that everything was effortless as it comes to others. That I cared about this world and my stay in.

At any rate, it's getting late. I'm getting too tired of life passing me by, of trying to live and failing."
depression,Am I only thinking I'm depressed and jist for attention? It confusing me very much and that is a reason why I still haven't old anyone yet. I'm too scared to tell anyone. Someone please help and give me some advice or something-
depression,"I recovered from depression, but feel myself falling back into the hole. several months ago, like 6+, all I did was go on zoloft. I was very anhedonic. I had little motivation if any. I had medications making me feel suicidal. zoloft really turned it all around. but I went off it and I felt good for a long time after. but I feel it coming back. I've lost my motivation to go back to the gym. the simple things like video games are losing my interest again. I'm so tired. and, I just have that feeling of a pit in my stomach. like you know when you feel sad, and your heart just drops? yeah, that. my life is fine, I'm progressing. I got a new car some weeks ago even. I'm studying for my future career. I have a job I kinda like. but everything is starting to feel very bleak again. I don't feel good. I went through a breakup a few months ago and that didn't help, but I'm over it for the most part. although now, I am lonely. I don't have anyone and I don't have a close relationship with my family. I don't know what's wrong with me but I do feel off. I guess I'm kinda just venting. I might go back to talking to a psychiatrist, I don't really have anyone to vent to person to person. maybe I'll get back on zoloft, I don't know."
depression,"After a few days I'm back again on my way to work. The last days I did not made it out of my bed in the morning because I had no energy and was to depressed. I also had a big fear not to make it to work and fail. 
Today it was hard to get up but I did it. The last weeks every morning was a big fight for me. I wish I could get up every morning."
depression,"I’m so tired of feel numb When I was first diagnosed with depression, I used to cry. I felt sad. Now I just feel empty inside. I feel alone and that I will always be alone. My sexuality isn’t treated seriously and dying without someone who loves me for me terrifies me. Another failed relationship because of my sexuality and I’m starting to lose all feeling for anything. It scares me."
depression,"Starting on a new journey. Wish me luck As I am writing, I am still not confident in myself of succeeding but I have no other choice.   


I am planning to move to a new city and start a somewhat new life there. I was born and raised in the same metro for 25 years. In the last seven years of my battle with depression, I barely made any new friends. My highschool friends are the only group I have.   


I want to make new friends. I want to experience things with different people, but my social skills are zilch. I also want to live in new cities and experience the local fun with people from those places. That is what always put me in a great mood. The cheap thrills of every city that only localites know.   


So I have decided to shift my life in the next few months and force myself to try again and again to make new connections with people. and like I said before, I have zero confidence but I am going ahead nonetheless.   


Lets see what I face."
depression,"I didn't go through shit, I don't have a story I am super depressed and I have suicidal thoughts, but nothing happened. I dont know why Im depressed. As a kid Ive always been invested in music and I wish i could be a rapper but I dont have a story and i sit here knowing that now i cant do it. But even if I did I have huge social anxiety and stage fright so I couldnt do it anyways. I cant do anything. I wont do anything. I am useless. I am lost. I am nothing"
depression,"My younger brother told me ""Bro, you look possessed"" because of how constantly sad I constantly look. My mother, stepfather, and eventually my dad would comment regularly ""Are you okay?"" Should I be worried? I usually tell them I'm not, but sometimes... I lie. I'm not suicidal, hell I'm scared sh*tless of death, I'm just depressed, man. Advice?"
depression,"What to do if I can’t be helped? Didn’t want to use my main to post this. I’m really sorry about the length for anyone who bothers to read.

So I’ve been depressed since I was a kid. My parents are messed up people and my life has always been isolated and weird compared to other kids. I also have Aspergers, ADHD, and DR/DP that made my life hellish. Now I’m 22 and all of it is worse than ever. 

I know I need a job, as having money and less time to ruminate and complain will surely help, but I have no clue how to do it at this point. Since I’ve been stuck in the apartment alone most days since March, I feel like my brain has melted. Like actual mashed potatoes in my skull. I have some good days but they’re few and far between and usually get ruined by something. 

I can’t remember shit anymore. Don’t even recall how to tie my shoes and had to literally look up a tutorial on how to boil an egg recently, something that I’ve done a hundred times. I’ve always been really slow and fuck everything up, the average toddler is smarter than me, but it’s worrying how bad my processing and memory have gotten. 

I have no hobbies (can’t concentrate). I cry all the time. I feel so fucking lonely. I struggle so hard every day just to shower and keep the apartment clean for my bf (we live together) but I just can’t eat or sleep anymore. I keep getting UTIs from forgetting to drink anything for days. Obsessive thoughts have taken over my mind. My body feels as rotten as my head and I’m constantly vomiting from anxiety or just feel very unwell in general.

It’s like I’m stuck in an endless bad dream where everything is fuzzy and gloomy and I can’t control anything I do or say. It’s an empty and awful existence. I wish I could grab myself and shake myself awake but I can’t. I can’t even explain to you in words how much it fucking hurts to live like this, so separated from real life.

All I think about when I’m alone is death and destroying myself. I can’t take it anymore. I feel unhinged and filthy. I’m not a real person like everyone else. I’m envious of those real people, who get jobs and have clean homes and talk to friends. It feels like I’m a separate species. Like in a room full of people, I feel like there is a grimy film coating my face and body that everyone can see. If that makes any sense. It makes me embarrassed to exist in the same space as anyone else because I feel like my very presence disgusts people. 

I turned in a job application in person the other day and everything my fingers brushed I swear I could see a trail of filth. I couldn’t even look the person in the eyes. It’s like everyone knew there was something wrong with me. I cried on the walk home and felt so stupid. It was so overwhelming to be that visible and to feel so visibly disgusting. 

Over the years I have tried exercise of all sorts, yoga, meditation, CBD, essential oils, daily routine, sleep hygiene, journaling, keto, LITERALLY ANYTHING that anyone told me might work, I tried it, even if it sounded ridiculous. I tried so many medications that did nothing for me and therapists who again and again turned me away saying they couldn’t help me anymore. I was going to give it another shot but I’m too broke now.

I don’t know. I feel so crazy like there’s nothing anyone can do to fix me. I’ve been messed up for so long I don’t know if it’s even possible to recover. My relationship is the only good thing I have and it’s going to end if I can’t stop being so dysfunctional and get a job. I want to be normal so badly, I just want to scream and cry. I’m so sick of hurting the very few people who care. I want them to be free, away from me. I feel like I’m a curse.

Is there a point where you have to give up because there’s nothing left to do? Are some people just unfixable? I’m seriously about to break."
depression,"I’m a mess. I need to tell someone this. I have a 9 year old daughter who has special needs. I am in an extremely depressive rut and struggling to get out of bed. She is fed an extremely healthy diet to help with her medical challenges, clothed, goes to school, plays netball, I keep up with her medical and therapeutic appointments. I lost my job due to covid, I am a single mum. Her paternal grandmother, the only one from the paternal side of her fam who sees her, that she doesn’t have time to see her anymore. 
Today. My daughter told me I am in bed too much and I need to play with her more. If she asks me to play I get up, her favourite things are playing charades, practicing netball and art. 
My own daughter is now letting me know she thinks I’m a bad mother. I’m crushed. I try my best, my best clearly isn’t enough."
depression,"I can feel myself getting worse and there is nothing I can do to stop it I am over a month late on a 150 word simple fucking assignment. I just got my midterm back and did worse than I thought. I put an easy project off until finals week and screwed myself. I have a presentation and 5 page paper due in like 6 hours and I haven’t even picked a topic. I haven’t really slept in like 2 weeks. I am eating like shit and feel awful every time I do. I finally got myself to shower after a few days but that feels pointless because I’m just going to have to do it again. I also have a 12 page paper due, a 10 page paper, 2 final exams, and a final assignment. All my professors think I’m a shitty student because I’ve asked for way too many extensions and still couldn’t keep the deadlines for those. I have a bunch of forms and shit due for next semester and I can’t even figure out if I want to go back in person because of how awful I’m doing. I needs to get another job soon because I’m doing bad financially but I can’t add more stress. I haven’t even started thinking about Christmas and I have no clue what to get for my family/friends or how I’m going to pay for anything. My GPA sucks and I was trying to raise it this semester which should have been east given how lax Professors are and how little is expected of me, but I can’t even do the bare minimum. Also I’m starting to worry about post graduation because I have no clue what I want to do and idk how I’m going to support myself and this whole college thing and all of this struggling feels really pointless without a plan for the future. My brother is super successful and makes so much right out of college and I’m happy for him, but it’s just hard comparing myself to him and feeling like a disappointment. Sorry this post is so long and all over the place I just really needed to rant. Depression and ADHD are really fucking me up and I think this semester might kill me. :/"
depression,"No solution, just a fleeting hint of warmth when someone can relate. I'm fucked in the brain. My brain developed in poverty, neglect, and abuse. I never really had friends, I was always an outcast, even amongst the outcasts. The stress is consuming me. I've resigned to a lonely life of fake smiles and forced cheerfulness. I'm really good at pretending. Occasionally I have fantasies of breaking out of the misery. They're just fantasies though. The truth is, no matter where I go, I'll always  return to misery. Or misery always returns to me. I can hold it off, when focused. I have to hold it together for at least a couple more years, for my kid. At times, I don't know if I'll make it, but here I am. It's the little things. The hope of a good football season, that tomorrow will be different. Talking about all of this can be little off putting, so I don't share these things, except occasionally with strangers on the internet. It wouldn't make a difference though. No matter how badly someone wants to help, they can't. Eventually they become frustrated. Despite all of their efforts, they could not fix me. Pointless to argue. I'm a black hole of misery. If I was never healthy, how can I return to health? How can I rebuild something that never existed?  I try to become healthy, or create health from books, music, art, and television. From the memories of people I think I remember well. None of it rings true. It's just me here. broken. alone"
depression,"Wondering if I am depressed This may not be the most coherent of posts. For background, I am a married 31-yo male.

tl;dr

I find myself getting less joy from things I like and getting more stuck in this worried/stressed/concerned state of mind despite good things happening to me.

Long story

I am the type to worry  and stress constantly. There was a period in my life two years ago that was more stressful than usual. There was a time during that period when I had suicidal thoughts, but I don’t have them anymore. During that period, I could never truly and fully enjoy anything, as there was always stress and worry running in the background that I can never turn off.

The stressors of that period are now gone. I am doing well in all aspects of my life: I am back to exercising (which does help mentally), I am doing well at work and just got promoted, recently moved to a new bigger place, taking music lessons again.

Had this all happened to the 21-yo me, I’d be over the moon. Yet, I don’t feel myself getting much joy out of anything. I am starting to wonder if that stressful period broke me.

This is all a bit ironic as I have many people in my life who come to me often for me help: my wife and parents and in-laws mostly, but other friends and relatives as well.

I have considered seeking professional advice from a therapist, just to make sure I am not at risk but never acted on it.

I am not sure any of this qualifies as depression or if this is the right subreddit."
depression,"I can't get out of bed and something small sent me spiraling back into a deep depression I've been depressed for as long as I can remember but lately I've been too depressed to get out of bed for 2 days and it's finals week, and I think the thing that actually set me off was a redditor telling me that maybe I don't want friends and I'm the problem because I didn't respond to his specific message. I was really polite in return but I mean if someone has no energy to answer or just doesn't want to talk to you, why follow up just to say something like that? It just reminded me of how I'm awful and it made me feel like I really don't deserve friends or a support system. I know that's just my depression speaking but it still feels that way. Like I know I shouldn't feel guilty but my mind is making me think I'm an actual piece of shit when I'm really only a moderate piece of shit"
depression,"Is there a point where I can't be helped? I keep returning to the se harmful habits I have, I'm aware they're harmful, however I keep returning to them, I feel as if there's no help for my anymore, I may just continue this until it either kills me or gets a place in the hospital. I try to better myself, however I just keep coming back to same shitty habits."
depression,"I don't think I'm depressed, but the fear that I am is growing on me I'm not very good at figuring out if I'm falling back into depression. I don't know if I've been feeling neutral for months or if I'm just not engaging with my feelings anymore, which is what I would normally do right before I have a bad spiral.

I can't afford therapy anymore, but I'm still on my meds (we'll see how long, haven't decided whether to stop because of financial reasons). But I've self harmed a bit recently, and feel no strong desire to stop like I often try to. Not that it's as bad as before. Nor am I suicidal as expected. I can laugh, smile, feel happy, etc. I just don't feel motivated to try and achieve the things that allow me to feel more at ease.  I don't like how my life is and I don't know if it's really worth it, but I have to live it.

Anyway, if you have any thoughts on whether it sounds like a deepening depression, that'd be great. I need to figure this out before I spiral to the point where I can no longer reach out to my friends. I'm not asking for a diagnosis of course, because I already have some hahaha rip (MDD and GAD)."
depression,Any advices you can give me? What do I do when my own parents gave up understanding me?
depression,This is too stressful I don't want to live like this Too many responsibilities. Too much work to do. 3 and a half more years of school. I don't want to do this anymore. It's too hard. Too much pressure. I wish I could live in the wild where all I have to worry about is getting food to eat. Nothing else. Why is life so hard. I'm stupid and ugly. There is no hope for me. Everyone hates me. I hate me. I wish I could die but I can't bring myself to do it. There are many things that bring me joy. But even more things that lead me to wanting to kill myself. I really hate life. I am going to continue to hate life. There are too many flaws in our society. I don't want to be apart of this anymore.
depression,"Is it normal to have depression but still be happy? I put off a lot of stuff and don't really ""try"" in life. But I'm not sad, moody, suicidal or anything like that."
depression,"my first post and yep, it’s depressing. For the past 12 years, not a day has gone by that I don’t wish I was dead or be disappointed when waking up in the mornings. I’m only 26. I don’t really have a sob story or even a logical explanation for these intrusive thoughts...but they are there..everyday..never fails. And sometimes (okay, all the time) it gets really overwhelming and I will either attempt death or partake in dangerous behaviors that could lead me down that path....am I alone?"

depression,"I Am Pathetic I feel...
Incredibly pathetic and stupid and worthless. I hate myself. I hate life. And I want to fucking die. I wish more than anything that I have an inoperable tumor and I die. I really really want to die and be dead sooner than later. I don’t want to experience life and I never asked to be here. Please oh please let that be the case. But of course because I actually want it, it’s not going to happen and I have to live on and be miserable forever. When I cut myself I feel pain, and feeling pain is a lot better than the feeling of wanting death. I’m truly so pathetic. I’m a waste of space and a waste of a human carcass. My life should truly go to someone who wants it. I beg everyday to die and nothing. Yet there are people who beg everyday to be alive. I don’t know. I don’t know how to fix this feeling when it seems like it something I’ve alway wanted. I hate this earth. I hate the horrible people that live in it. I hate America and it’s stupid racist bullshit. I hate that the world has to be such a violent and fearful place. I know I know, theres a whole lotta good in it. But it is so hard for me to stay positive when there are children dying or crying of pain. It’s so hard when so many women and men go through some sort of sexual trauma. It’s so hard when people are literally starving to death or have little to no rights because some stupid ass corrupted bitch rules the country. I hate this world and the terrible shit it has in it. How am I supposed to want to live when all I see and hear is trauma after trauma after trauma. And then theres my stupid pathetic self. Who literally takes life for granted and doesn’t want to do or achieve anything. I am literally a wasted human. My soul did not want to experience the human life. My soul got lost from its dreams when I was 3. 3 years old is when someone else decided to take away everything I was supposed to be and it when I unconsciously decided to disassociate and was never really able to grow. I barley know myself and I’m 26. I don’t try anything because I suck. I have zero confidence in myself and I don’t see any of my dreams coming true because I suck. I never been in love because I’ve never loved myself. The only reason why I stay alive is for my family and close friends. I could never be the reason for their sadness. I’m so tired. And the saddest thing of all is that I actually am worthless and stupid. I can’t even fight for myself to loose weight or do something productive or really fight for my dream. Instead I sit in my own pathetic pool of misery that I’ve created for myself. I truly feel like I am a lost pathetic cause. How do you find the will to fight for what you want, when at age 3 you lost faith in everything? Anyone else? Just me?"
depression,"My low point This past week my mind has been fuzzy and I just can't seem to think clearly about anything. This has frustrated me and as a result I've became snappy and short tempered with my loved ones. This reached a low point last night where I was standing on a bridge ready to jump feeling I'd pushed away everyone who cares about me and that the world would be better off without me. I'm so grateful my girlfriend phoned me and stayed on the line til she came and got me, I was at the lowest point I've ever been mentally. A few minutes away from death and she dragged me out of it. Please if you feel there is nobody who cares about you I promise you that there is and that there's always light at the end of the tunnel"
depression,"please i need advice 😥 I often felt  like being isolated in my own home, and my parents often blame me for everything wrong that's going on in our house.
Does this means they hate me? Sometimes when I look at them I have this feeling that they look more like a happy family without me. 
Most of times I wish I didn't exist at all."
depression,"I’m planning on stopping treatment I don’t feel any different after two years of therapy and antidepressants, why pay hundreds of dollars for them? The world was not built for depressed people, so it’s time for me to go back to the mask. I almost died, but before then I at least had the illusion of happiness. That’s better than nothing."
depression,"Idk Hi. So I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few months back. After a month of taking antidepressants I started to feel better after being in really bad shape like couldn’t get out of bed even if I wanted to, I was mentally exhausted, went days without showering, lost 9 pounds, didn’t feel like eating/ wasn’t hungry, I would constantly cry. I ended up doing horrible on my clases and failing.

I thought I was getting better but now I feel like I somehow ended back where I was. I feel like I have tried so many self-care techniques, counseling, working out, getting enough sleep, eating well, and nothing helps. So I just gave up on everything. 

My bf told me that I needed to focus on myself and do things that make me happy but it’s so hard. He also said that he didn’t want to hear about how sad I am or my problems anymore because he was dealing with his own things. Like I get it we’ve together for a long time, I know I can be a negative person, and he’s always been very supportive with everything until now. So I have tried my best to keep everything to myself and write it on my journal. I feel that my happiness revolves around him and everything I do. I been trying my best to deal with my own problems and not let it affect our relationship. But ever since we had that conversation I’ve cried every night and felt alone. 

I tried working out which I struggle to get motivated to start but I feel great after. Then that feeling goes away  and then I want to workout again to feel better. I also been having trouble doing my assignments or anything. 

I’m sorry for anyone who’s going through something like this or worse. You’re not alone 💗 Don’t give up."
depression,"Is it a bad idea for me (18m) to talk to my cousin (15f), who is deep into psychology and has it dead set on her mind as a career, about my feelings I told her I was depressed before, but I never went into detail of why I’m depressed. I’m running out of people to talk to. My dad got sick of me and I nor anyone else wants to pay for a therapist. 

She’s actually pretty mature for her age, I think, but I wouldn’t want to break her and think it’s her fault if I do anything to harm myself.

I love talking to you guys lol but having that person-to-person connection just hits different, you know?"
depression,"I'm a terrible person to be around I cannot help but think that. I suck as a friend, even worse at making one. I make people around me uncomfortable. Whenever I try to connect to someone, I always feel like I creep them out. When it does go nicely, sooner or later I would drop the ball. I would be too forward, or share too much, or say something stupid, and destroy whatever potential of a good relationship.

Fuck man..."
depression,"I wish I could go back in time to when I was a teenager Posting this here mainly because I don't know where to post it(and I'm depressed).   I miss emo/poppunk/screamo being popular and mainstream.   It felt like I could relate, like everything around me was messed up and it was thing I could latch onto.  I miss the video games I used to play, especially everquest and wow when they were slower and felt like they had more heart.   I miss when I was forced to interact with people in high school and secretly would hope the girl I liked would notice me.   I miss when my main desire in life was to make a name for myself, when I was angry, when my depression was like a raging sadness that made me feel actual emotions.  I miss when I had actual hope for the future and actual friends or people I talked to.   I miss when I actually cared about learning about other people.

I feel like instead of fighting the angry depression as a teenager, I'm now fighting an apathy.  I'm completely alone, my life is boring, I have no one to reach out to or talk to.   The world has changed around me and I feel like I've been left behind wanting the things from my past.   I feel like nothing new is anything I can really connect to and I feel completely out of place and lost.   When I go back and listen to music videos from like 2007 I just wish I could go back."
depression,"Don't be afraid to change your therapist Hello people. After going to the same therapist for 5+ years I decided that it wasn't helping anymore. I found a new therapist and tried EMDR (I encourage everyone to read about it) and I feel a lot more emotionally stable than I have in a long time. Sometimes I even feel normal!
If you feel like what you're doing atm doesn't help try out something new. It's hard but you can do it! 
That's all. Have a good (or at least an okay) day!"
depression,"What do I even do? 

It feels as if every important life milestone occurs within the same 3-5 year period, and it's overwhelming. Two years ago I couldn't even drive a car, now I'm leaving home in just a few months, and I have to have a plan. Or, maybe I don't, but I have to live somehow.  

I'm going to leave home distressed, and I will collapse quickly. I can't really go into college, nor do I want to, my resumé is incredibly weak, and I don't have a rich family I can just mooch on for life, unfortunately. 


I am completely fucked. I sent my entire time in HS being depressed and suicidal, and my reward for that is poor academics, no contacts, and head-start on the homeless Olympics. 



Every single day, I say it'd just be easier to end it, and yet I never do. Not having to worry about school, finances, the future, the present, *the fucking everything*, would be amazing. I'm almost at that point where I wouldn't even mind hospitalized, at least it's a break from daily life. 


Maybe one day I'll do it, or maybe I won't, - I don't really know."
depression,I feel like I can't catch up I can't get the motivation to do anything. I feel like I just lay in bed while my life wastes away but I don't care enough or have enough drive to do anything about it. I'm already so behind and I feel like it's too late. I would rather die at this point

depression,"I find it hopeless I'm 23yo, girl.
This is the worst year of my life...
At the beginning of the year, COVID came.
In May, my dad left home because he betrayed my mum.

In June, problems between my ex and I started. He officially dumped me in August, after 4 years of long distance relationship. Everyone and I always thought we would get married. He was in my life plan. I paid so much for the relationship then he gave up everything.

Afterwards, I got my Tinder account. I started my dating life which I have never tried before. (My ex and I met in university. He didn't even kiss me before we became a couple.) I met quite a few guys, had chemistry with them. But they disappeared suddenly. Some of them told me I'm a nice girl but they were not looking for a relationship or they were not the right one, even though they found me attractive. There were some nice guys who liked me but I didn't feel anything so I had to reject... I've been using apps for 3 months but still, no one is here.

Next week is my birthday but I can't really celebrate due to COVID. 

I'm a teacher. I'm nice and kind. I'm also good looking. I am never bad to people. I don't know why I have to be punished like this this year. I'm really sad.

Actually only my best friend and my parents know about the breakup but I don't want bring negativity for them so I rarely tell them my feelings. Sometimes I feel better but mostly I am not okay. Every day I'm just living, go to work, go back home, do postgraduate studies. I live like a normal person. Smile all the time to people and my students. But I know I'm only pretending to be happy. I know I have to live just because I don't have to courage to die. I can't even see a silver lining."
depression,"Suicide ideation, lack of discipline - just overall hopelessness. I have battled suicidal thoughts and ideation since I was a teenager. I'm in my 30s now, and contemplating dying just seems... normal. Hell, I'm not even sure why I'm writing this now. I haven't amounted to anything in life, and I lack the discipline to buckle down and learn a new skill. 

I've spent my life wanting to be an artist. I invest in supplies, romanticize the idea of working in the gaming industry - but at the end of the day I just can't bring myself to try. I'm unemployed for the first time since I was 15, and it feels like the walls are closing in. 

I almost hate the moments of clarity I have where I can clearly see what my depression and anxiety are doing to me. I've filed to go back to school, I've applied to jobs, etc. Yet, at the end of the day I tell myself that no one would miss me - that my boyfriend and dog would be okay and move on just fine without me. 

FWIW, I'm on medication - it just keeps me from feeling much of anything honestly."
depression,"Feeling powerless against friend’s depression I have a friend that has been depressed for about a year I thought he had gotten better after some time but it seems that it is back as strong as before, I am honestly really bad at understanding others feelings and I simply don’t know what to do, we go out and play games together quite often,I think I should ask if everything is ok and if I can do anything to help, but I doubt I can do anything. If you were to get help how would you want it? This post is honestly more to vent my thoughts than anything, best of luck to all of you :/"
depression,"fuck everything I really thought I'd feel the happiness for a while longer, but nah. im back to the depressed stage, I don't wanna do anything, I CANT move bc my body feels like it's gonna crumble , I don't wanna eat fuck I hate this. feel like disappearing every second of my life, and my mother keeps swearing at me and talking crap about everything I do or everyone I talk to. ill be fine"
depression,"Wishing you never existed I know people would be devastated if someone around them died, and I don’t want to hurt those I love.

depression,"Channeling depression into anger? Is there any advice on this? I’m not going to explain my story but it is for sure about depression and not just sadness.

depression,I don’t want to commit suicide but i wish i never existed OCD caused my depression i do have suicidal thoughts but im so scared of committing suicide i just wish i never existed.
depression,"I feel so stuck I’ve been trying my best not to complain and whine so much but my anxiety and depression has been bothering me a lot lately to the point where I can’t really sleep and I’m always so tense.  My head feels like a fog and I catch myself talking to myself sometimes when I’m doing something like washing the dishes and I’m scared that people will catch me doing it one day.  I’m sure they’ve probably heard it before when I didn’t notice since I’m a bit zoned out lately.

I am so stressed about wrapping up my classes that I am paralyzed in doing the most simplest things sometimes.  Just want it all to end I’m so fucking tired.  I don’t want to even think about anything anymore.  Feel so fucking broken and I’m never going to get better.

I’ve spent more time looking into suicide methods and I can’t find any good options.  Every single one seems like a shit way to go and I’m just choosing between how effective something is vs how much I might suffer with considerations of how much privacy I would need while not risking that family members would find me potentially scarring them.  Even this part is impossible.

If people understood the distress people like me feels constantly every day, you would not make peaceful suicide options so inaccessible.  But as it is today it’s damn near impossible to die peacefully on your own.  At best I’ll leave an immense mess and go through a great deal of pain in my final moments or risk permanent injury and potentially be stuck here paralyzed and incapable of even taking my life.  What kind of a sick joke is that?

I’m so fucking tired.  This isn’t some thing I’m saying on a whim but I’ve thought about this for a long time (years) under duress and very clear-headed.  I want out but I need to stay around for family while they’re still here.  Might still have a while to go but eventually I want out.  I wish there was something available to help take the stress out of living.  Wish there were better options available to me."

depression,"Am I in Depression? Is it just sadness/phase of life? Should I see a doctor   

I am 22 year old male, currently a student. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I dont have interest in life. I dont see the point of living for long. We die anyways. (I dont believe in an afterlife. It used to be my only meaning earlier until I became an atheist/agnostic a few months back) .   
  I would prefer to be dead. I wont do suicide as it would shame my family infront of others and they would feel sad, and I don’t want to give a wrong message to others.  
 I would be happy to get cancer and die at this age, or any other disease or maybe an accident. (Basically the death shouldn’t be my fault.)   
  But still my family would be sad that I lost my life at an earlier age.
2. I think I will stay single for life because :  
 \- I dont think I can become a good father and I don’t want to destroy a child’s life.  
 \- I am also scared of being a good husband and I dont want to destroy someone’s life.   
 Its better I stay single throughout.   
 Also, I am free. I can do whatever I want. But I definitely will have to stay with my parents to take care of them.
3. I feel I have very low self esteem. I think its the result of a lot of bullying I experienced in school as a child. I didnt have a bunch of close friends. Maybe my personality wasn’t good.   
 But I didnt personally feel very dejected then, or thought about it a lot. I just took it and didn’t react. I even forgot about the bullying for a pretty long time.   
 But I still had low self esteem throughout, though I didn’t notice it as such. I thought it was good. I always brushed off appreciation, I always downgraded myself when I am alone or in front of others, I always seek validation. When someone criticizes me or misunderstands me , etc I feel very dejected and sad. Even now I have very low self esteem.   
 I remember 2 instances in school time where I didnt go to a party and an outing where I was invited, because I felt they called me since they had to and really didn’t like having me around. But I think I was wrong. Don’t know.   
 A few months back, I got a message from one of the people who apologized for bullying me while in school, it was then when I remembered the bullying and realized, that my low self esteem could be due to that. 
4. I also had something like anxiety attacks or anxiety during past few months. I remembered when I was pretty scared to present in a competition and it didnt go quite well and I had the anxiety episode throughout the day even after the presentation.  
 (Do understand that I have gone for various public speaking competitions earlier and even won prizes too. I definitely do get racing heart before going on stage, which I used to disappear once on stage, and I would forget all about it.)
5. I am unable to handle stressful situations, and studying now. (Especially for long periods.)
6. I feel I have a bit of OCD (Not diagnosed. Just self diagnosed by reading stuff on internet) . I have lot of obsessive thoughts at some times but I dont remember doing any compulsions for the same. I dont have the neatness based symptoms I feel. 

I am returning to college in a few weeks and I have my final exams in a few months. That is a really stresssful situation. I am really scared if I would be able to pull it off. 

I dont know if I have clinical depression or is it just a phase of life due to COVID-19.

I am also pretty scared to take any medications like antidepressants too.

What to do? Should I see a psychiatrist?"

Today I decided I want to try my best to turn things around. I woke up on time. Couldn’t get dressed but I did a little yoga, thought of something I am thankful for and sat my ass down at the correct time, at the table to go to work (I work from home). I had a video call. Nobody noticed my pyjama shirt as it looks like a normal shirt. Better half-assed than nothing right? So far so good. But after that I found out I made a mistake at work. I forgot to to something yesterday I promised I would, I just totally forgot. I started crying and now I lie here on the floor of my bedroom and I just can’t get up anymore.

I loved her so much, she abused of me, she broke my heart. I cry everyday, I'm so depressed, I usually love playing, but now, I don't want.

But idk if I will even feel better in the future, bc idk if depression tricking me or something but I'm losing hope.

I'm not at the top level of mental health this week and I didn't pay attention to my hygiene and the state of my studio. So I had to make him wait outside to tidy up my appartment, open the window, hide my dirty dishes in the drawers 😭. I tidied up a part but everything was not perfect, he didn't make any comment, (fortunately).

depression,"depression caused by dentist visits Hi, I have anxiety but I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I just have constant depressive episodes in the days leading to and after dental treatment.

I have really bad teeth, I was never told to brush as a child and I had a really bad dentist who even as a child never injected me with anaesthetic did extractions and fillings which completely traumatized me. I put off going to the dentist completely after I was around 10 and only at 18 I decided to maybe take care of my dental health as I saw my yellowy and crooked teeth were just making me really conscious of my smile 

I met with another dentist to whom I explained my past resistance to dental procedures and in the beginning he was kind, confirming every step if I wanted him to stop, allowed me to play music so I could put the smell and sound of drilling behind me.

 around 6 months later, since after I've had 3 cavities filled, decided to get braces since my dentist recommended them saying it was due to the crooked nature of my teeth I kept missing spots and I also thought it would be good for aesthetics as well.

But my dentist wasn't as nice as he used to be. I had 3 extractions since then for braces but then I wasn't allowed to play music or distract myself in any way. If I wanted to stop his assistants would hold down my arm and say that it's okay it'll be over soon. Even the anesthetics were only availble for extractions. Ever since then it's been a traumatising experience, at the beginning of the treatment I discovered  that I have an impacted canine stuck due to my milk tooth not having fallen off. He recommended surgery which would pretty much involve tearing open the part above my mouth and my dad said I wouldn't be able to handle that and put it to rest.

Since then everytime there something or the other which is wrong. I am tired and unhappy and cranky all the time. Not to mention dental treatment isn't covered by my parents insurance and it's so expensive.
Every time I leave from there and cry. Today I went in for my cleaning (which is painful because my gums bleed) and found out I have yet another cavity due to my brushing habits and another extraction for a tooth to allign my teeth. I also have to get my upper braces put. I have exams next week and a month later another major set of exams 

Life just seems so bleak. I just can't handle this anymore...I've lost my will to live and my teeth don't even get better."
depression,"I need Ur opinion I need insights. For the past 2 years I've been feeling very weak and rough.. there are times I couldn't just couldn't go through the day... Im not sure if I'm experiencing depression or I'm just consumed by the thought of social media standards tht being in bed and weak is depression or I might just be putting it all in my head. I know tht Ur not supposed to be self diagnosing, so I didn't.. I mean I do go through much more (sleepless nights, trauma flashbacks and sudden increase in heart rate at random moments) I do like to get myself check with a professional, but my parents 100% will not understand... I hv kinda talked abt this before with them but I don't think they understand the roughness of going through it. So, is there like another way of understanding what I'm going through?

Ps: I have distance myself from all my friends, step back from social media and all, nothing makes me happy.. I can't do normal activities and I'm constantly tired.. but there are days tht I'm just fine like (does tht make me less close to being depress?).. I laugh with my parents ... Mostly because I have to fake being mentally, emotionally, physically tired around them...  I think since being qurantine at my parents home makes me stay more intact with myself and life because I know I can't feel or be sad around them..."
depression,"I’m not sure if I have depression or if something is seriously wrong with me. Im(16M) and I’m wondering if I have depression. I have a few really close friends, consider myself about an 8/10 attractive wise and my dad makes 6 figures and my mom is stay at home. I live such a perfect life I don’t really understand why I feel terrible all the time. I don’t cry. I have a handful of attractive women that are interested in me but I just don’t feel any motivation to talk to them. Besides working out every day I usually spend most of my time just laying in bed. I recently got caught by my parents for smoking weed and am now getting tested. I used to rely on it to make my anxiety go away but now I don’t really know what to do. I’m also trying to throw away nicotine but I JUST CANT DO IT. I also believe that I am becoming an alcoholic because I use it as a distraction to my problems. I’d like to have a girlfriend to rely on but I just don’t feel motivation to make a commitment like that. My last(and only) girlfriend of 8 months upped and left me out of nowhere for another guy which tore me apart. I never wronged her or anything. I also have bad grades and even though I spend all my time in bed I don’t ever get anything done. Am I depressed or just not motivated enough/lazy?"
depression,"A small win I’m not entirely sure if this belongs here but it’ll have to do. I’ve been depressed, among dealing with other issues, for a decent amount of time now. And as I look back on my day, week, month etc. it’s difficult to find anything to be proud of. But it’s finals week and I turned in my final project three days before it was due. I don’t know what happened, I cannot remember a single time in university where procrastination wasn’t at the forefront of my attempts at schoolwork. I always do things last minute and usually have trouble getting assignments in on time."
depression,"I’m Very Confused! Was I Ever Truly Depressed, Am I Manic, or Is It The Medicine Working? I went from feeling like straight crap...barely able to get out of bed, crying spells at random, hating myself, having extreme low self esteem, thoughts of self harm, thoughts of suicide, sleeping my life away during the day, insomnia at night, and staying in my apartment for days (this went on for two months recently but I have times where I feel this way off and on over the years) and now for the near past month, I finally feel fine. I’m not extremely happy but I do look forward to each day, am motivated, and I feel nothing like I’ve described above.

I’ve had challenges with jobs and money as far as being in jobs I hated and depending on those jobs for my only source of income. I quit 6 jobs this year was fired from one and two let me go abruptly as a contractor from a staffing agency. 

Stress from work definitely triggered a depressed state. I’m now in a job where I work by billing hours for a consulting work that I’m doing on a project. I don’t actually really have to interact with anyone if I don’t want to and it feels great. There’s no one asking me a thousand questions or breathing down my throat about when I’m going to have a deliverable.

I also live alone and deal with isolation. Sometimes by choice I isolate myself and other times it’s beyond my control.

Being alone at the moment feels exhilarating but then a few weeks ago it was making me insane. 

I have no clue what this all means.

Was I just responding to my environment and a series of unfortunate events? 

Do I seem to actually have depression? Does it seem situational or clinical?

Or could I be bipolar and the meds are finally stabilizing me?

I’m on Latuda and Wellbutrin.


I don’t know what this all means and am hoping that someone could give their insight.

Thanks."
depression,It’s so empty it hurts But I did this to myself..I’m so stupid lol..stop doing things your making it worse..haha yea i deserve this
depression,"Hi. I'm 22 and I'm exhausted For the last years I had some good times but then it become double worse and year after year going down and down. It's all like a suffer adapt. It gets worse - I adapt, again - I adapt again. And year after year it goes like that. Oh my god I'm so tired. I feel like a squeezed lemon.

At this time i have no money to pay the bills. I live at provincial Russian town and there is nothing to do, no friends, no work. I currently study for motion design and i had some good progress before autumn. But now i'm burnout and even small every day task takes a lot of strengh. There is no support for such things. Russia is for sad people. There are nothing exept my bills pressure and because of that i can't think about anything different. I have a lot of problems with my mental health i tried to fix that all by my self but i cannot. And the theraphist cost so much and even more when your income is 0. I recieved orders to work last year but now the crisis is here and it's so hard to find people who need my services.

I know the way to go but i'm stuck. What should i do?"
depression,"I’ve been struggling lately and it’s affecting my relationship. I know, I know. I should be thankful to even have a relationship.

But lately I’ve hit a huge depressive streak and spiral and have been saying stupid things to my girlfriend that I don’t mean. It’s making me upset, I can’t articulate what’s actually bothering me but I can’t apologize enough to her when I articulate something wrong. She lied about something recently and instead of saying she invaded my trust I straight up said I don’t trust her anymore which isn’t true.

It’s been a year since I’ve lost this much desire to live and I don’t know what to do. I’m not as equipped as before. I was able to ignore it when we first started dating because everything was new and exciting but now I just say and do stupid things and my girlfriend acts like depression isn’t good enough justification for my terrible articulation. And it’s not, so I beat myself up about it. Why do I say such dumb things?

And then I feel angry, why can’t she forgive me? I always forgive her. She says it’s fine but consistently the air is harder to breathe around her when I say something wrong. And then I feel worse because she might be telling the truth but I don’t believe her.

We’ve been dating a year and a half and have always been able to communicate but lately we only sort of can. I feel I can’t talk about my depression because she just doesn’t understand me.

I feel I did a lot to help her out of her self hating and anxiety but now that I’m depressed again I just feel so high and dry. its like she doesn’t want to care at all. She’d rather be in ignorant bliss than know how I’m really doing.

Lately what’s made her mad at me is that my sex drive has just plummeted. I say I find her attractive and I always do without a doubt but she doesn’t believe me. I still try to fulfill her appetite but since I don’t feel in the mood she lies and says she isn’t.

I just want to fucking die. She’s the only person I can talk to hence why I’ve reinstalled reddit and am ranting about my problems to strangers again for the first time in a year it feels like. I just feel so isolated. While I write this all out I can’t help but feel pathetic. A month ago I was excelling at so many things and here I am again where I was a year ago. Life is just so regrettable. If there was a non traumatizing way to disappear I’d have already done it."
depression,"Experience with Viibryd Recently I went to my doctor for my depression and was prescribed viibryd which I’ve never heard of. I’m only on day 3 and I’m already experiencing bad nausea, dry mouth, and am having problems sleeping ( i take the pill at night as recommended by my dr) 

I’m not sure how much longer I want to continue taking this because the dose as of now is 10mg and it goes up to 40 mg after 2 weeks. I’ve also read into the side effects and some of them seem terrible. What are some of your experiences with viibryd? Anything helps, thank you!"
depression,I want to tell people I’m depressed but I don’t want to be treated differently. I’m pretty sure I’m depressed and want to tell others but I don’t want to be given special treatment or anything.
depression,"when should i be concerned about voices? + did i have a panic attack? i have MDD, ADD, OCD and SAD and few last days i’ve heard a male voice whisper ”hey” twice. it sounded like it came behind my door, but there was nobody. the voice also said my name and ”open” but those weren’t very clear so i’m not sure about it.

in the past i’ve had these weird dissociation attacks where my vision goes weird i forget who i am and where i am and i get stuck in this kind of loop where i try to tell myself what is happening but then lose track of everything again and it keeps repeating like this for a while.

i think i also had a panic attack yesterday at school after 5 hours of sleep. my psych nurse told me to check my heart rate sometimes, because the last time it was a little high. i was at school and i checked my HR. i became worried because it was 100 and it started raising over 120... so my heart was pounding and i could see my heartbeat through my shirt. i was so jittery, my muscles were tense and legs were so stiff when i tried to walk. i was dizzy and i almost passed out. i was searching for ways to calm down your heartrate, but they didn’t work. this shit went away once i went outside and when i got home my heartrate lowered to 80. i was so tired and tense the rest of the day."
depression,"Starting to wonder if there's any point No kids, self employed and pretty unmotivated. I have a loving but sometimes difficult wife (some of that is my doing). A lot of winter blah and covid quarantine. I'm having a really tough time typing all the crap that was in my head a minute ago, but I just need to get this off my chest.

I guess the bottom line is I don't see any reason to finish off the rest of my life. I'm in my late 40's. And just to be clear, that comes off as way more serious than it should- I often flirt with the idea of suicide, but I don't have any plans on it and I'm pretty damn sure I would never follow through. I don't mean to alarm anyone or be dramatic.

On the other hand, the future is just a random void. I don't want to wake up everyday to more nothingness. The last 10 years have been hard, and I'm tired. I pretty much feel like crying. 

So, thanks for reading. I'm not being very clear on why I'm here posting, and what I expect in return. I just need to vent for a minute. Life can be so lonely."
depression,"21 bouncing from job to job and I'm EXHAUSTED I'm only 21 and I'm on my 11th job since I've been 17. A few of them being only for a month or less, but still. I just got out of a pretty shitty retail job and went to another better paying retail job. I was excited at first but now I'm back to the whole dreading work thing. Sometimes I can't even enjoy my day off the later in the day it gets because I know I have work the next day. Job after job ends up like this eventually, since quicker than others. Idk why I don't like my new job exactly but I think it's cause my last retail job, I'd zone out SO much sometimes and I guess it was a way to help me get thru the day. Also, my new job is giving me 6-8 hour shifts almost every day of the week and I JUST got here. I mean I know what I put for my availability, but now it just adds to the stress. I feel that maybe retail is too much for me mentally right now, but I don't want to quit ANOTHER job so quick and having all these jobs on an application makes it SO hard to get hired somewhere else.  But I know that I do NOT want to go to college and I know a lot of time that doesn't even help in getting a good job. I just want to be happy for once with the job that I have. It seems like no one likes their job but they're not quitting for whatever reason. I always feel like such a loser when I want to quit/quit another job without a lot of time going by. But once I call out one day for a mental health day, it's hard to not make it an every day thing. And the ppl around me tell me it's ok to take a mental health day and even a girl at work said that at the end of the day, it's about what's right for ME. I'm writing this and I have an 8-4 shift and a zoom job interview afterwards but idk about that. I'm kinda excited?? I've looked so hard for a work from home job but the ones I found were so low paying. It's hard to not just wanna lay in bed all day and sleep, but that's what wanna do. I wanna quit. I wanna call out. I wanna just lay in bed and be slightly happy. The days I do call out, I end up feeling better after the guilt of letting my fellow coworkers down. The hardest part is that it's ONLY me. I live with roommates, my family won't talk to me anymore and I'm single. I have no one to rely on if I did wanna quit my job and just take a break for a while.  It's just me, myself and I which I know other ppl are out there living their best life being like me but I'm not. And it just makes me feel so bad mentally and emotionally. Like I can't handle anything. I'm crying rn thinking about not wanting to go to work and being so sick of feeling like this. I HATE it."
depression,"i've always wanted my life to be special... and it was, after all, but no one saw it I don't go to church, but there's a saying that god has a sense of humor. Why is that? Because ""he"" gives you whatever you want, but not how you'd want it.
Right from the start; i suffer(ed) from a depression. That alone i'd endure. Much rather i couldn't live with an absolute and constant feeling of lost, unable to come down to earth, unable to relax, unable to calm down, to see the true image. I was for years locked somewhere deep in my psyche, yet it felt that i was nonstop at the front line. I felt every punch in the face i'd ever get to be truly raw however i couldn't dodge it, ever. I was hyper-mind, but with a frozen body. Punches and falls felt like disastrous end of the world every time. I grew tired after my 22nd year of age. I wanted to die a long before, and it felt normal for me to feel this way. It came and went, but i'd always recover from it. This time, I figured, if i wanted to die, i'd have to do it quickly and without a second thought. So i looked out for a psychiatrist. Fast forward, two years passed, while on pills, and first time after 2 years i finally feel like getting better.
While finally recovering from the coma of depression, i realise that my life was special after all in its sick, sadistic manner. And no one could even witness it, not from my point of view, at least. I can't even give it a spit in the face, because it's my face i'd be spitting into 🤷‍♂️ It was hell on earth. I was stripped of all I had, long way before i could do anything about it, i believe; and of many things i will, or rather won't have. Here i am, so far alive, spat out of a bull's ass called 'youth' naked and above all, contemptuous. Such things as a cancer i no longer fear. Maybe only war or a prison. I'm still not a jerk to other people. I don't want to live forever, i'd like to die someday. The knowledge of death someday, makes me happy. So that's what 'god' wants me to be; obedient and contemptuous citizen, who maybe, pays taxes, as well."
depression,"Wellbutrin to get me out of bed? I have been in my bed for the past week and been really depressed. I have no motivation to do anything.

I started Zoloft last week so I’m waiting for it to work still but I heard Wellbutrin helps people get out and do stuff.

Has anybody had experience with this drug and did it help you get motivated?"
depression,"I’m a big time loser at 20. This is probably going to go unnoticed but whatever.

I have no friends because I’ve been a loner most of my life. Never even had a girlfriend. 

Everyone is more successful than me. 

I can’t remember anything I learn and it is so unbelievably rage-inducing that I cry every day. 

I’m about to graduate high school (only have to finish algebra 2) but even studying feels like a herculean task.

College is out of the question since my memory is shit, and i have no idea what to do with my pathetic life. Also I don’t want to drive myself to suicide. 

I think about suicide every day. If only death wasn’t so scary I would go through with it."
depression,wanna be hopeful i’ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety and ocd (now my doc has been considering bipolar too) but it’s been months of new meds after new meds and i’m trying to stay hopeful one will work. i’m on lamictal right now and was just in effexor so the withdrawal from that is making everything worse. i’m just worried i’m not going to find one that will work. also i’m terrified of all the side effects of this current one and kinda want to just stop meds overall. idk it’s hard
depression,"Genuine ways to deal with depression I need to stop taking prescription meds and drinking alcohol and find a genuine way to deal with my depression. I’ve tried countless therapists, is there any other way?"
depression,Am I doing it for attention? I'm not diagnosis with anything. I feel like nobody believes me until I have a episode breakdown whatever you wanna call it. Even then I'm not doing enough harm it feels like. I have no proof. I might have a problem but I just words just dumb words. I think I'm romanticizing it. Idk I've been have dreams of torture and assault since I was a kid. I don't have any trauma in that department so why do I dream about in detail? None of my reasons are valid i mean dreams and inner thoughts degrading me. Even then I'm not allowed to have problems at least not diagnosed that's just another part of me to be embarrassed about. I make jokes to the point where my friends get uncomfortable. Am I trying too hard to force depression. I always say I'm just lazy and unmotivated that seem to make people feel better. I can't do anything without burdening my friends and family. I can't tell if I'm doing it for attention or saying that I am to cope.
depression,"i wish college was a one size fits all School has never been my strong suit, but my academics progressively got worse with my mental illnesses. I'm in my first year of college now, and I thought it would be different (it is, but not in the ways I expected it to be, with COVID-19 and all).

I don't know what I expected, with a history of depression and anxiety for nearly seven years now. It never seems to get better, even with therapy and medication. It's just been a cycle of depressive episodes and mental health crises, and school has done nothing but contributed to that. 

I love learning, but not ""learning"" in the way that I'm expected to learn in our education systems. It just, I don't know, doesn't *work* for me. There's hardly any accommodations or leniency for students who are mentally ill... not to say there's none. They're just lacking, in many ways.

It's not normal, or at least shouldn't be normal, for school to make me feel so helpless. Frozen even. It's overwhelming to make up six weeks of Spanish 101 in six hours, because the only accommodation my teachers can seemingly make is extending deadlines. 

All the time in the world isn't going to magically nullify my depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts- just so I can complete a ridiculous amount of assignments that I missed in the first place BECAUSE I was depressed. It just. Doesn't make sense. It's not going to put an end to my depressive episode that caused me to be a shut-in for the past two months, just wishing I wouldn't wake up in my bed every morning.

I wish I could just. Fit in. Fit in this rigid prerequisite for a future career and fit in the expectations my mom has for me. She never had the opportunity to go to high school, yet alone college. College isn't something I want for myself, but it's something I fear will regret if I don't get a stupid degree. 

What's the point if I can't get good grades in the first place because of my declining mental health? I wish my family understood me better. I wish others understood me better in general, really.

I hate college, I hate everything about college. I feel trapped and alone."
depression,"I'm not going to kill myself. I'm just at my wits' end with everyone and even more so with myself. Nothing brings me joy - I mean I do things that temporarily distract me but they don't actually make me happy.

I'm full of rage - pure, unadultered rage. But it's all internal. I hate everybody and I especially hate myself.

I can't even cry anymore - I've become so numb that nothing even registers inside of me enough to make me feel the sadness needed to cry.

I want to be left alone - this includes family, friends, perspective boyfriends. If I had the means I would take off to a remote town where nobody knows me and start over.

Does anyone else feel like me?"
depression,"What is the History of Depression? In the writings of the second millennium of B.C.E in [**Mesopotamia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia), People considered Depression a spiritual condition rather than physical. People believed Depression to be birth by demonic possession. As a result of the beliefs, priests dealt with it rather than physicians. In cultures like *Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Chinese, or Egyptians,* people believed that evil spirits or demons caused Depression. They treated it with approaches such as starvation, beatings, and physical restraint to drive the demons out of the human body.  

Did you know this?"
depression,"Im so done with this reality IM SO DONE. This reality is boring and pointless. I just go to school for 8 hours a day. I wish I were born in a fantasy world. I want to learn magic, I want adventure, danger, and a sense of FREEDOM. I am dead at school. I live in my imagination, thinking up of stories, of a world where I have friends and we go on an adventure, where we slay dragons, where we meet gods. I want to escape. I wish that I was born in a fantasy reality, where magic is real. I want to die, then be reincarnated into a new reality.    I have read books about magical worlds. Every time I finish a good series, I feel empty inside because I know that that world is so, so far away. There has to be more to life then finding the value of ""X"". I don't really know why I am still alive at this point. Im so bored and empty. I want magic and adventure. I want danger and freedom. I want romance and love. I want to be a part of an epic story. Castles and dragons, wizards and quests. It's cliche, but it's how I feel. I want to leave."
depression,I do not deserve to eat i dont deserve to eat if im not living
depression,Can depression cause you to have a short temper or say things you don’t mean? I recently said some stupid things to my girlfriend that I didn’t mean and it brought up the question as to whether or not depression can cause you to say stupid things?
depression,Is it bad that I cant get up in the morning I always stay up and get like 3 or 4 hours of sleep maybe less. But recently I can barely even move my arms to rub my eyes in the morning. Mom mom wakes me up an hour before school and i pass out to wake up again to her telling me 5 more minutes before classes. I go to my classes then lay in bed. Either i wake up later and leave or the teacher kicks me out. Or maybe I cant sleep but Im laying there with my eyes closed over the top tired. Then after classes I will sleep till lile 3pm. During 7th grade Id always go to sleep at 12 or 1. During 8th about 3/4 days of school I would go to sleep at mostly 5 to 6 am and wake up at 7:50 for school. Since it's online school starts at 9am but Im still falling asleep at about 5. How bad is it that I never get more than 5 hours of sleep? Also Im 14 so Im going to be brain dead probably as an adult.
depression,"i don’t feel like any of this is fair at all i just lost one of the best friendships i’d ever had all because of one mistake. i felt weak and frail, powerless and alone, desperately needing someone, and when one of my friends reacted poorly to me constantly nagging her for some company i lashed out at her and said awful things, but that wasn’t me, i’m not like that, i loved her like a sister and the last thing i could ever want in the world would be to hurt her. but it didn’t matter, one little slip up in the middle of a breakdown was all it took to rip away a whole year of friendship. i don’t know what to do anymore, i wish i could turn back time and control myself better, or get one more chance... it’s always like this, i always lose control and let my emotions hurt those around me, i’m so done with being so useless... why can’t things ever go right? everything always ends with me crying and other people happy, i just wanna be happy for more than a few months damnit..."
depression,"The school system can rot in hell Sitting on a computer 6 hours a day listening to shit I don’t care about, shit I won’t ever need to use again in my entire life. I don’t care about my grades anymore, because why should I? What’s the point of getting a good grade when I can’t even go to college because of this stupid fucking pandemic nobody in this godforsaken country takes seriously?

This one teacher marked me tardy because I didn’t log onto class 2 minutes after she took attendance. Being “tardy” has always been 5-10 minutes late, not fucking 2. I know she hates me, and I hate her. Most of the time I want to punch her in the throat. Her snarky little comments about everything I do, her over the top condescendence, the whole passive aggressive nature of her is just the worst. I have her for two of my classes.

I just don’t care about anything anymore"
depression,"Am I depressive enough to go to a stationary clinic? Hi there,

I am struggling with somewhat hard depression for about 3-4 months which is geting worse and worse. I have only realized it's a depression about 3 weeks ago and decided to speak about it openly to my friends and some of my family. I want to treat it as natural as possible since it is a illness that needs treatment.

I deserve to feel better and I deserve a fulfilling live.

I work as a nurse and worked at three different corona wards 4 weeks ago and got the virus myself. It didn't hit me super hard, but the isolation made my depression worse. The isolation is over since yesterday and I don't have any more symptoms, but a huge lack of energy, which I think has to do with both a) corona and b) the depression.

For how bad my depression is: during the past 3 weeks there was only 1 day, which was yesterday, where I managed to stand up before 12 o clock, and that was only because I had to, because my appointment at the doc was at 11.

My days go by in the circle of sleeping til about 1pm, gaming and watching Youtube stuff whole day, cooking/cleaning my kitchen in the most minimum way one could imagine, trying to sleep at about 11 but usually failing and though I am super tired only geting to sleep at 2-4am. My flat is a mess and I cannot find energy / Motivation to clean it, I haven't washed my bedsheets for 6 weeks though I would like to... 

I have suicidal thoughts, but not really concrete ones. It's more like when I go to sleep I feel like ""not waking up tomorrow would be nice"".

I don't find energy to do much. Like showering and cooking a meal and that's it. Yesterday I had my dr. Appointment where I told him all this, and had to go grocery shopping after ( about 1,5hrs) cuz i needed stuff and when i got home I wanted to change 1 lightbulb in my kitchen which was dead. After doing all this I was just done. I couldn't even play dota or any games or watch some videos, it was about 3pm and I was fuckin tired and had to go to sleep.

Stood up again at 5pm because a friend brought me some packages and carried on with the cycle of gaming / watching stuff etc.

On the one side I enjoy this nothingness and sitting around gaming.
On the other side I hate everything of it. I was an active and motivated young adult (am 28), who was doing sport several times a week and motivated for creative work like writing etc. And all this is gone. I always wanted to write a novel and had written 140pages of one, but I can't think of continuing with it...

My problem is, that I know psychiatric clinics from different views. I worked on some clinics as a nurse and when I was 17 I have already been in a clinic when I had a major depression. I don't feel like I am as sick as other people are that I saw as patients there... Yes, i am sick and I want to change it, but my dr. Brought the topic on the table and well, now I am thinking about it.

 He said ""You wont be able to work with a depression"" and somehow I think he is right.... I don't know how it will work out if I have to start working again next week. I mean, I know it will work because I have no choice... And that's the point somehow - I can work if I have to. I am not that sick that I couldnt ""push through""...

Am I sick enough to go stationary? Where is the line there?"
depression,"Im scared of it being forever Im not even sure if im depressed. This cant be fucking normal but ive never been diagnosed. I fit the 'Criteria' but im scared of self diagnosing.

depression,"Explain this please When someone says “being weirds a good thing”, can’t help but to tell them to shut the fuck up. It not a good thing. It’s fucking horrible. Idek why I was labeled the weird kid. It was just the way it was. It sucks because people don’t talk to you, don’t ask you to hang out, and even the fuckin outcasted rejects hate you. God fucking damn it all I want to fucking die. Ramble of a post but what the fuck ever my life is a run on sentence of a joke that takes too long to finish."
depression,I feel disconnected I feel like whenever I am around people I feel so disconnected from people. I feel like I never know what to say. And i’m so sensitive. Inside my head I feel that everyone hates me. I feel this way even toward my family. And I know it’s completely irrational. I spend so much time sitting around just wishing I wasn’t here so I didn’t have to suffer. My life on the outside looks great. i’m 18. a good looking kid going to college. but i’m deeply depressed. i have been for a majority of my teen years. and i think a huge problem i have is that i can’t explain why i’m sad. and whenever i try to get help people make me feel like i’m ungrateful. that i have no reason to be sad. so i shit myself off to everyone in my life. I’m really low right now and just needed to vent. i’m sorry if this bums anyone out.
depression,"Venting: Birth Control Has Made My Already Troublesome Depression Nearly Unbearable I entered my first real romantic relationship this summer with my boyfriend... I'm 21, so I kinda feel like a late bloomer and insecure about my inexperience. Anyway, I got the implant as a form of birth control to protect myself from unwanted pregnancy. It's working on that note, but the trade-off has been an unwanted deluge of depressive thoughts/tendencies that I thought I'd really overcome in high school. I'm fighting back tears writing this because it's just a really dark place I thought I'd finally escaped. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety as a teen, and for over five years I thought about ending things every single day. As I became an adult, I learned several ways to cope with my feelings in healthy ways. Now that I've got the implant though, none of those things are working. I've lost interest in all the things that used to make me feel magical. I used to be quite spiritual and now I barely believe in God. I've been difficult with my sweet and understanding boyfriend, pushing him away because I feel my depression is unbearable anyway and he will soon realize that he should date someone mentally stable. I quit my day job after losing my temper with a superior because suddenly it was unbearable and all I wanted to do was escape. I've lost ten pounds, without even trying over the course of maybe a month or two. I barely leave the house to do basic things like grocery shopping because the depression talks me out of it and makes everything pointless; I never got my driver's license for similar reasons. I live at home with my mom rent free while building my career as a  musician. And the music is one thing that's going really well, it's my main motivation to keep going, but I still feel like a total loser. I don't feel like I deserve any of the free food I'm eating or the free roof over my head, or the boyfriend tolerating me. And I feel so much anger at myself for not being able to pick it back up and get it together as quickly as I want to. I'm so grateful for my family understanding, but of course mental illness runs in my family so they know how it feels to be paralyzed by fear and guilt for simply existing. It's so weird that I went on birth control in attempts to take my health and my relationship seriously, and it's actually made my health and relationship deteriorate. Anyway, I just came here to vent about my experience. My greatest fear is that even when I come off of birth control, the depression will stay with me the way it did when I was a teen and my healthy coping mechanisms will continue to fail. Giving up is not an option though."
depression,"Things that helped me with my depression Here’s some things that helped me with my depression :)

1. Strength training. I don’t. Have a gym membership but I have a few sets of dumbbells at my house. I don’t know why, but lifting makes me feel good.
2. Music. I listen to music a lot. When I draw, paint, shower, cook, etc. It makes me have fun while I do things.
3. Eating better. I added more food into my diet and also more fruits and veggies. Nothing crazy though. But it makes me feel good.
4. Avoiding negativity. This one helps a lot. Not sure how to explain it. But for example if a tv show is talking about depression or suicide I will change the channel. 

I’m no doctor and I don’t know if this will help anyone but I wanted to share what helped me. Maybe it can inspire someone. It gets better. Sending so much happiness to everyone reading this. I hope you find what your looking for out in this beautiful world :)"
depression,"i can't catch a break and life is becoming insufferable i've dealt with depression half my life so i'm used to feeling this way. i have perpetual feelings of sadness and hopeless but i'm able to function just enough to take part in society. lately tho it's been impossible to even do this. it seems like i'm always receiving some sort of bad news and i can't stop ruminating over very dark times in my past. i feel so worthless and i truly believe i'd be better off dead. no one can stand to be around me because i'm so depressing and i'll never find friends or love. i've been intensely crying for hours straight every night, to the point where i'm shaking and drenched in sweat when i'm done. i experience suicidal ideation on a daily basis but it's gotten much worse. i've considered jumping off the roof of my building but there's dirt/plants on the perimeter rather than concrete. i calculated how much length i'd need to hang myself (actually break my neck, not slowly suffocate) and my ceiling is too low. i know life isn't fair but it literally feels like i can't catch a break and i'm not sure how much longer i can do this."
depression,I am depression I don't *have* depression. I am depression. It's who I am now. It's all I remember about myself anymore. It's the only way I know how to be.
depression,"I feel like people only talk to me as a last resort. Growing up I always felt I was the friend of a friend. No one cared about me enough to initiate conversations or invite me but acted friendly when I was around. I could feel it in the moment. But I kept a smile on and acted fine. But I was never fine and no one ever asked me if I was fine. 

Even now at 29 years old I feel this way. I never get invited anywhere, or get called or texted first. I am the one who initiates everything and if I don’t then people don’t talk to me. It hurts. Like the only time I am ever thought of is as a last resort. When every other option is exhausted. When people have no one else they go to me. And when better plans come up they absconded me. If we’re are on a phone call they only stay until someone else can talk then they hang up on me. Why does it happen all the time? Why doesn’t anyone like me?"

depression,"I’m 17, have no direction in life, will become homeless Idk if this qualifies as depression but I don’t feel like I’m good at anything in particular.

Also, I don’t rlly have any passions and I’m kinda concerned about it. My one passion is football and I have a blog about it and I’m obsessed. I love my Cincinnati Bengals and all my thoughts revolve around football. They say guys think about sex every 7 seconds or something, well I think about football every 3 seconds. I just love it and am always watching football film or whatever snippets I can get my hands on but at the same time, I feel like it’s a totally useless passion that won’t be helpful at all to me but I just cannot shake my love for the game. This is kinda disorganized but imma indian teenager doing my college apps rn and I should have some semblance of a direction in my life but I have 0 idea of what I want to do I am so fucking stressed at all times about it.

depression,Disadvantages of admitting yourself into a psych ward? I’m not going to go into the nitty gritty of what happened. But to say I’ve had a full on psychotic break today is an understatement.

 I'm bad. Really fucking bad my morbid curiosity got the better of me so I googled the ld50 of a med I take and learned a dark joke amongst medical professional and pharma folks is in order to die from them you'd either have to choke on one or drown in a vat of them.(((there's a few who probably know what it is))) cool well guess I'll just go cry in the shower and hope I don't wake anyone else in the house up. Brain: oh just cheer up. Thanks how come I haven't ever thought of that for the last 30 fucking years. (((It's your fault anyway brain))) I'm so tired of this. Diagnosed in fucking 2nd grade you'd think I'd be used to dealing with it by now but I'm so tired of fighting it especially right now it's bad almost bad enough I'm thinking of admitting myself but we just got off quarantine for covid and we barely had the money to cover bills before that bullshit. I admit myself and I'm even more fucked. (((Besides I'm probably more sane than the staff))) I'll make it through because I don't have a choice. I just want one fucking day of peace where my own brain doesn't say hey, hey pal yeah drive into the oncoming tanker truck (((wow fuck you brain terrible idea))) or oh dear God there's people here better make it feel like you're about to have a heart attack with an elephant sitting on your chest while everyone around you stares and keeps walking ((( thanks again brain you fucking prick))) or hey you're just about to fall asleep here's ten thousand stupid fucking ideas you couldn't think about earlier when you were trying to solve a problem and the icing on this particular shit cake is now you feel like an even bigger idiot because the solution just slapped you in the face with a God Damned baseball bat (((really should try and write these down))).

Holy shit the nightmares oh yeah let's just make horror movies look like comedies and give you utterly insane nightmares that you wake up from a couple times a night so fucking scared you try to scream and can barely manage a squeak tears streaming down my face so bad I can't see when I finally manage to sit up I just sit there in shock. When I stop shaking I check to make sure everyone else is ok and sleeping and then I lay back down and fall back asleep because now I'm tired from crying and being scared so far out of my own head it's not even funny. But guess what here's round two fucko enjoy the show(((I absolutely do not enjoy the show))). If you read this I'm sorry you can worry about me but I'll survive if it hasn't killed me yet despite sometimes feeling like it might (((fuck you panic attacks))) I'll be ok I'll keep fighting my own brain internalizing it except for the occasional rants like this when everything just busts through the cracks but I'll patch the holes in my walls put on a happy face and keep trying to fake it until I make it or at least get a chance to find my happy place for a little while and let some of this bullshit evaporate. I needed to vent to get this off my chest ((more like brain but whatever that guys an asshole anyway)) I appreciate anybody who took the time to read this i really truly do because you'll reach out and make sure I'm ok (( or maybe you'll feel less alone in your particular struggles)) maybe not right away maybe a few hours later maybe a few days maybe you'll check on me in a few weeks but between my own coping mechanisms and my friends and family and random folks on here who even just say hey I'm here it's more powerful than I can express right now.

depression,"I'm just tired It's a rough night, I'm not suicidal but some wishing for death below, don't read if that will bother you.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just feeling some quiet despair right now. One of those times where I feel like all is lost. I just tired and weak. I have little to no hope, and no real passion. I am alone, and will remain that way for the foreseeable future because I seem to have lost the ability to connect with people. It feels hard to even imagine what friendship looks like anymore. Romance is of course completely off the table, I'm a wreck after all. 

I'm early thirties and frankly feel like I'm less mature than most twenty-one year olds. I've fallen so behind that it's hard to imagine ever being a functional part of society. Of course, I could do more, far, far more to actually work towards achieving goals if I just wanted to.

I just don't.

I dunno, it's a combo if thinking that nothing will help, but mostly just a lack of any vitality. I know its not completely impossible that may change. If nothing else, at some point I may get desperate enough to try riskier stuff like electroshock or psychedelics or something. 

haha honestly I really like the idea of electroshock therapy. I hate my brain, I want to go full-on Palpatine and Sith lightning that little bastard. 

But it's just hard to imagine anything ever changing. I wish I got a mulligan, new body, new family, new life. I feel like it's possible to be happy, it's just nights like tonight my emotions make me feel certain that I'll never make it there."

depression,"̶R̶a̶g̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶r̶i̶c̶h̶e̶s̶ Riches to rags I used to have it all. I had a bright outlook on life (or at least not as glum as I do now), good grades, good friends that I could hold engaging conversations with, confidence in my own abilities, and, most importantly, the drive to put my skills to good use. I could write, draw, sing. I might not have been particularly good at any of them, but I prided myself on my range of interests and I thoroughly enjoyed these activities. Sure, there was the customary malaise of teenagehood, but it didn’t bother me too much.

Fast forward to 5 years later. I oversleep everyday, and on the rare occasion of waking up early, I waste my head start on the day on my phone. Some of the friends that I was closest to knock me only when they need help and don’t bother to invite me to hangouts. I feel like an alien even around the friends that I still have a moderately close relationship with. I have little confidence and I can barely muster any enthusiasm for the activities that I loved so much. I feel so much dumber and physically and mentally lethargic. My skills are rusty and the terrible decline I have suffered in my writing and thinking capacity just breaks my heart. Even now as I write, I can feel how much my skills have degenerated. The words stumble over each other, coming in stops and starts. That which I would require thirty minutes to write now takes an hour. The flow and ease with which I could think and write is long gone. 

I have always been a class topper and my sole motivation to maintain my consistency was the fact that I had an academic reputation to uphold. I used to be, quite literally, afraid of failure. I still am. I have never been externally incentivized to maintain my academic performance. In my teens, I used to hope for some special recognition and appreciation for my results, seeing as how my peers would get the latest gaming consoles or other gifts regardless of their results. I, on the other hand, have had to face my father's disappointment for my failure to, say, achieve a position in country-level maths olympiad after winning at regional level. The rigorous expectations from me, coupled with the lack of the guidance, assurance and validation that I required in my formative years, did not really set the proper foundation for me to build the following years of my life upon. I have elder sisters who have always supported me to the best of their abilities, for which I shall always be grateful, but no one apart from your parents can really fill the shoes that you want them to wear.

My fragile foundations started to crumble with the worsening of my acne which I had had for almost two years. I was at that point in life where social conformity and popularity seem to be of the essence, so, voila, I had now unlocked social anxiety and depression followed suit not much later. My acne was assuaged by medication and I overcame my depression but I could never reach the level of confidence I required to actively participate in activities, engage with the people around me and to realize the potential I had grown up believing I had.

In recent times, upon seeing how wonderfully people around me are comporting themselves and the success they are achieving, I can't help lamenting the opportunities I missed and messed up and the potential I never fulfilled. I am back in that pit again.

I wish I could go back in time."

I just talked with my bestfriend who I've fallen for. But I've only known him on the internet. We chat almost everday. He's cute. I love him. I get jealous when he is with other people. I love him.

We talked. And he saw me bring up a pill bottle. He made a joke, said chug, I laughed and chugged. He thought I feigned. I chugged again and drop the bottle. He stopped. I said ""There"". He said ""Why?"" I said ""I dunno, I don't care"". He said ""Hanna, are you serious?"" I said ""Yes"" He went silent. Then I told him my thoughts. And he stayed silent. And he said ""You're going to make me feel responsible for this"". And I said ""I know, I don't care"". And he sounded upset. He begged me to call if I feel funny. But I don't want to. He sounded upset for himself when he talked. And we signed off. And he went to bed.

depression,"Fuck this I don’t feel anything anymore. Literally all my emotions have been slowly turned into nothing but anger the past few years. I’m angry at myself, at the world, at everything. I despise it all, especially myself. I just wish this torture would end."
depression,"This emptiness called life Hey everyone, I’m new to Reddit and thought I’d vent about my life. Maybe someone can relate. So I started life in quite an unfair way, I’ll try to stay humble but there’s times where it’s just blatantly the truth. My mother would have me on the weekdays and after elementary school on Friday My dad would pick me up to go to his place. Was born with split parents who were both in poverty. My dad was a taxi driver and my mom enjoyed not having to work by living off welfare. I have 2 half siblings who’s fathers ditched them, not sure if it’s because of my mom or what but I was somewhat lucky to have my dad in my life. My sister is older by 5 years and my brother is older by 14 years. So anyways let’s get back to the beginning. Living with this disadvantage didn’t really bother me as a kid until I started to become self aware about things that weren’t right. Kids around me would talk and relate about how their families would have dinners (Thanksgivings, Christmas, Easter, etc) and I would be confused because I never had that. My mother was very abusive towards me and my sister, it really got bad when I was about 12 years of age when my sister started to run away and sleep under bridges/friends houses. She then developed  a really bad drug habit. It was hard drugs that really changed my sister and being only 12 it was horrible to see. She got into more harder drugs like meth which almost killed her twice. During all this she had 2 kids with 2 different fathers (sound familiar). I wasn’t as lucky though, due to being only 12 I had to work with the after math of my angry mother gullies with hatred towards my sister. She ended up taking it out on me and I then first started to get suicidal. I remember the age perfectly because I was excited to become a teenager due to 13teen being the first year technically. Anyways I then started to hide every time it was time for my dad to take me back to my mothers house due to it being hell. She would always yell at me and fight with my dad over child payments and I would end up going hungry due to this. I then really developed an introvert personality due to not being able to relate to the other kids and just being stressed all the time. I would really sink time into video games in a very unhealthy way to escape this hell of a reality. It became very unhealthy in high school and I would skip out on doing homework and socializing with other students. That being said I didn’t have a lot of friends and was picked on/bullied. Weight gain and body imagine then started to become another issue, nobody cared about a fat kid in high school. It was all about the kids with 6 packs and cars. I never really opened up to anyone about the issues going on at home, until I had enough due to the break downs. I was missing too much class and my grades were suffering so I reached out to counselling. I finally let it all out to this guy and felt relieved to finally be able to get support in this. I was able to talk with him for a year and he explained to teachers what I was going through so they’d be more understanding. Come to think about it, it didn’t really help me. Who cares if I was missing material but still getting the same grades? Once I got to university it wouldn’t matter what I went through to my physics professor, I would’ve been eaten alive. Well anyways the counseling stopped abruptly when I graduated and I never could find him again. I was broken, finally I was able to talk to someone about this and it backfired. Once again I was alone with em this shit mess. Oh right, you guys don’t know that I wanted to be a dentist and was taking all the sciences through all this trying to keep my head above water. In my last year of high school it really came clear that I wouldn’t be able to handle the stress, debt, and costs of university. I was on my last straw and didn’t know what to do, so I became an electrician. This was the biggest accomplishment of my life, I’m so grateful I chose this path instead. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this decision. Finally I could afford food and independence, not having to painstakingly ask for help from my parents. Saved for my first car and that’s when life really seemed to take off. Oh right, forgot to tell you guys I was staying with my mom still due to having nowhere else to turn. I tried living with my father but he’s very much of a victim. Everything and anything bad that happened to him he blamed on something else. Was also a very toxic individual, which I couldn’t handle. So I resorted on continuing to stay with my mother. She wasn’t abusive anymore due to me being way bigger than her, but she still loved to make my life hell in different ways. At least I was able to isolate myself and not have to talk with her. Anyways so looking back now, I should’ve moved out once I got a job as an electrician. Thinking money was more valuable than my sanity with living with my mother. I had PTSD and depressive episodes every couple weeks that would cripple me for days. But I was determined to continue to save money to get out of there and not have to ask for help or look back. It was going great until I hit a string of depressive episodes which landed me a gambling addiction to hopefully strike lucky to get out, and when I’d lose 1000$ in one night at the casino I’d drink and think about suicide. This was a common occurrence for a couple years off and on. I finally kicked the gambling habit but ramped up the drinking a bit to compensate. There would be nights where I’d get blackout drunk and miss work the next day. Things were looking very grim once again. Until I started working out of town and started making really money. Working 6-7 days a week, 10-12 hour days. But with all that money meant being able to cope with the depression in unhealthy ways for a quick out, instead of saving to get out of my mothers house. I kept working hard and finally I was fed up, I resorted to just moving to the other side of the city and renting a room from a family. The amount of relief I felt after doing this is unexplainable. There wasn’t anymore PTSD and I felt like I could think clearer. It was all fine and dandy until I realized there were multiple things making me depressed. 1. My abusive mother (who I finally got away from) 2. Not having family/friends. I was alone and felt empty. 3. Realizing money wouldn’t fix this empty feeling and everything seemed futile. So here I am now, I finally have enough money to buy a house for the next step in my life, hopefully find a great girl to start a family with and fill this empty void. I really should seek therapy, and I feel like I didn’t do justice with how I explained all this. Found my self jumping back and forth adding and deleting things, so I’m sorry if some of it doesn’t make sense. Well anyways that’s the rant/venting I have for tonight. If you guys have any questions/guidance feel free to ask."
depression,"Why everything is so hopeless? (Advice: sorry for my bad english, isn't my first language and at this hour I can't concentrate well)

I hate say my quarantine style of life beings 4 years ago, feeling extremely lonely and depressed, without any friends and lack of social interaction. At that time my parents forced me to went into a therapy I felt useful and even important again.

Fortunately when I enter to college I felt everything start to get better, socialize was more easier for me and people talk to me more often, everything before we was forced to do lockdown. Through all this year I fell in love with someone for a first time in my life, unfortunately in internet because I was ghosted suddenly and made me feel more lonely and pathetic, plus the stress of online college that was close to made me crazy (and the reason why I take a break of it).

I thought in even kill myself but I'm grateful with my few online friends, are the only thing I have now with  my family of course, I try to do the best for them, while I deal with problems with my dad and my even my unstable mood that made me feel down often.

Now I just try to tolerate myself with my constant depressive thoughts and unstable mood, while I hide it to my family and being very coward to go for help, I don't want concern my family about it, this pandemia is enough for everyone to be stressed for me too. I don't know what to do except wait something happen or I'll do something stupid."
depression,"Don't know what to do Have been feeling empty for a while now but shrugged it off thinking that it was because nothing interesting was going on in my life. Realized a few days back that I was and took a test in this book called Feeling good and it says that I am moderately depressed but even after this I just find it hard to accept that I am depressed and it's like the problems I face are not even close to what others have to go through. 

This is not even the worst part, I have got an exam tomorrow and I can't even concentrate. When I start reading nothing gets in and it's not like I am doing something else instead of studying. I have been sitting in front of the book for over an hour and still don't understand a single thing ( and it's not because the topic is hard, I went through it before and had no problem then ). I can't enjoy anything now and can't get any work done. If I fuck up my upcoming exams then I am screwed for life. 

I don't have anybody close to me to whom I can talk about this and seeking professional help is not an option as it's really expensive where I live and I don't want to make my parents do more for me than they already have. 

I just don't know what to do now and am making this post hoping that somebody can help me."
depression,"Why Why why why do I have to exist 

I didn’t ask for any of this"
depression,"I’m burning out. This last semester has been really rough. I don’t feel like myself, y’know? 

I’ve gained like 20 pounds in the past semester (adding to the 10 pounds from last year), which has been making me feel terrible. Two family members have died, and I don’t even feel very sad about it, but my direct family has been mourning. This club I’m trying to start is being pushed back because of COVID. I never see my friends because I’m too busy keeping up with schoolwork. I’m always behind on schoolwork. I did bad on my last few assessments. To add to that, we never get a break to catch up since this semester is condensed. I’m pretty sure I’m balding now because of the stress, so unless I get in shape, i’m going to be ugly, and I’ll never find love if I’m ugly. 

My sister is also stressed and so are all my friends, and I wanna be able to help them and make class easier for them, and I did at the beginning of the semester, but now I’m the one in need and I’m the one asking for help. I’ve felt so worthless lately.

Literally, the only thing i’ve done right this semester is get into a skin care routine."
depression,"I sound like a cliche Yes, I feel like a burden to others, I feel demotivated when it comes to everything, I hate my life and pretty much every aspect of it. I've lost hope, but I'm scared of getting help.

Why is it that I sound like a combination of the first results from googling ""depression cliches""? I'm worried about talking about anything with friends, possible therapists, or anyone because I'm worried it'll just seem like I looked up symptoms of depression and am parroting them. It's just that every single cliche describes me to a ""T"""
depression,"I Miss Being In The Mental Hospital The feeling of being in a community of people who understand and are supportive of you was something I needed at the time. I have online friends that I talk to all day every day... It's not the same as having in-person interaction and conversation. I miss having people in my real life ask me if I'm ok or if I'm doing alright. Feeling like somebody cares for you is a drug. I think it filled a little bit of the void that my ex dug deeper into my heart. I wish I had some way to meet like minded good people because for now at least, that void is still there."
depression,"Do I actually have depression? Hey all,

This is my first post, sorry if it's a little awkward. I'm not quite sober, but I feel like I've been asking this for years. I've been told by multiple people that I might be depressed. My issue is that I feel like that makes me less of a person. Don't tell me ""being depressed is normal. Don't think less of yourself."" If you're a member of this community you should know that's not helpful. I love you all, but one thing I've noticed about this sub is that no one actually gives help, everyone just argues over who is most depressed in comments.

TLDR; I might be depressed, but I'm scared of a diagnosis. I don't want sympathy, I want real advice for people that are scared be diagnosed as ""depressed"". Should we go to a therapist? Should we build support systems? What are our best options if we don't want to be depressed?"
depression,"I feel so bad I want to die.
I van stop thinking 
I always disturbed 
I think i want  to get out of this world.
How can i do that?"
depression,"i'm so tired i'm so tired. here i was, this extremely lonely and depressed guy, i was working out regularly, hanging out with cool friends, enjoying talking to people at work (not really work itself but everything else made up for it). i'm incredibly shy and incredibly lonely, but i was starting to feel more confident and was gonna try my luck on some dating sites soon

then of all fucking things, a pandemic happens. my work closes the work gym, i get laid off a week later. mental health has been deteriorating over the last few months, more in the last few weeks. i still see my friends but every tiny thing about them i don't like is now 50000x worse. everything has gone to shit for me. only a fucking pandemic could stop me from shattering old weighlifting  records of mine, from making out with a cutie, from having money to spend shit on.

now im approaching depression that feels like the worst its been in years. i will have no money soon. i rarely leave my apartment. i have no hope. i want to care about finding a job and living but i just don't anymore. i feel lonelier than i've felt in years. it took me ages to get to the point of being almost happy and having joy and a fucking pandemic ruined it all

to make things worse, i found out a girl i was madly in love with (never dated) a few years ago ""did stuff"" with one of my closer friends and now my heart aches constantly, and i have no idea what my feelings are for my friend anymore. i was JUST getting over this girl, i had a legitimate mental breakthrough somehow 2-3 weeks ago where i suddenly wasn't thinking about her 9 billion times a day...and now that's all i think about again.

i'm just so tired."
depression,"The path to my situation A year ago, I was anorexic. I did it because I hated the way I looked like. I wasn’t really fat, I wasn’t thin. Normal weight, but a bit closer to overweight. I started eating less, I lost 16kg in less than half of a year. I was pretty close to starving back then. Even if all the thinking about food strongly effected my mental health, There was a point where I was happy with my looks and my weight. But my mother carried me to the next therapist. Every week, it was pure torture for me, answering the pointless questions of a man I didn‘t like, then checking my weight in front of him. He always dared to send me into an institution in case I haven‘t reached a certain weight the following week. I had to eat, even if that was the worst scenario for me. I think all this forcefeeding that rid me into depression. 

When I reached the weight they wanted me to have, the one therapy stopped. For my mother, the topic was over, my weight was normal, her child was normal. Everything is fine. Even if my mother supported me in that time I feel like a part of her support was to get me back to normal. I think she was embarrassed of her daughter being weird. Understandable. My mental breakdowns had transformed into a serious depression, but my mother didn‘t recognize at all. I tried telling her several times, but she didn‘t take me serious.

 I was 14 after all. 14 year olds are sad. That‘s what she thought. I think that‘s so unfair. Just because teenagers are down sometimes, is that a reason of considering them as safe from any mental disorders? Even if it was my age, does it matter? Is the reason for me being down relevant at all? Is the age an excuse for not taking someones problems seriously? 

The only one listening to me was second therapist. I met her every second week and we talked for about 2 hours. She somehow managed to make me feel fine! After 9 months of depression or at least depressed mood at the beginning I was feeling epic. I suddenly loved my life, loved myself, literally everything! I was sure I‘d never feel that way again, I felt like I can do it, make something out of my life, everything felt perfect. I can‘t describe how happy I was. All she said to me was ‚Just remember, everyone and everything is fine the way it is.‘ 

Well, I was wrong. It last for maybe one are one and a half months. Then, from one day to another, I felt worse than I ever did. From that point on, I refused going back to therapy. It was way to expensive, I wasn‘t worth that much. Also, my mother had a terrible fight with her husband, where I was close to calling the police because it was escalating so badly. They divorced, and she doesn‘t have that much money anymore. After all, she has to feed two children. So why waste the money on therapy for a hopeless kid? And here I am, the non-depressed depression girl not knowing whether she wants to die.

I don‘t wanna be alive. If live has a meaning, then everyone has an individual one. But I can‘t find mine. I‘m tired of it. But I can‘t cross my heart to leave my loved ones alone. I just can‘t...
I‘m useless no matter how you look at it. All I‘m doing is making others sad and causing problems. But I gotta live. Because I‘m so weak.

Thank you all for listening. I think I just wanted to write my thoughts down and I think I will do so more often from now on."
depression,I love you I love every single one of you guys in here. We all have something in common why we’re here thank you guys for always trying and looking out for each other
depression,"I need to vent.. Hi everyone. I hope you're doing well and staying safe through this pandemic

I just had alot on my chest and I needed to get it off before I do something stupid to myself because it's just been alot. 

Where do I even start. 

It's been a while since I've been on this subreddit. I've had a year and a half, or well maybe I guess it'd be about two years of hellish experiences and I guess more than anything I just needed to get it all off my chest and vent somewhere.

I guess it all started when I moved to a new province with my parents and my ex fiance, turned out it wasn't the best relationship for me and it was quite a toxic one Infact, being verbally and physically abused by her on the daily wasn't something that I was expecting and I guess to keep that long story short it led into me breaking up with her and the such. A month or two later my parents made the decision to move back to another province which is 15 hours away due to simplicity's sake and financial reasons, I did not go with them due to the fact that I developed a new relationship in that time with a woman that to this day I am still with. For better or for worse.

The start of the relationship was a rocky road, threats from her ex, etc,  to her friends ostracizing me from the group because I wasn't born here. People in small cities/towns aren't really the most welcoming to newcomers, but I mean for the most part they came around. Except for a few. I guess it's not all bad now.  But I can't help but to this day to feel like an outcast or as if I don't belong.

My anxiety and panic attacks returned. I'm an epileptic and I was consuming CBD cannabis for the therapeutic effects. Well got a hold of one strain that had a little too much thc and I had the worst panic attack of my life. Causing dp/dr and bringing out my anxiety to full force. This was right before the start of covid around Feburary. My dp/dr is still present to this day. Not as bad I guess and the panic attacks have definitely dwindled down to maybe once a week instead of of multiple every day. But the horrifying experience has left me so scared of marijuana that even smelling it causes me a massive panic attack thinking that I'm going to get accidentally high and feel that way again. I've even dropped 50 pounds due to the fact that I'm scared to eat thinking it might be drugged or laced with edibles or some shit? Idk. Stupid obsessive and intrusive thoughts. I guess one might call it paranoia but I guess it's just an extension of my anxiety due to the experience and the derealization being really bad.

We've moved 3 times in the past year. Once to a new home with her cousin and her girlfriend into a beautiful house where we were all splitting the rent 4 ways. This was 2 months after covid. So in a financially tough spot but we all wanted a bigger and nicer place out of the city. It was all good until our landlord has a psychotic break due to mixing his medications with alcohol and marijuana causing him to almost choke out my girlfriends mother.  So we moved in with her aunt for a bit and now we have our own minihome out in the country. Which would he great.. if I was allowed to go anywhere. Being an epileptic I can't drive without another licensed passenger in the car, so unless the girlfriend is home or wants to go out for a drive. I'm stuck here. But it's.right next.door to.her families so it's great for her I guess. And I don't really have any friends here.. but I just.miss living in the city because atleast I could walk places if I needed to get out.

I've been working alot, for the past year, that is until I threw out my back doing physical labour in a warehouse. Now I'm almost bed ridden most of the time due to the chronic pain of a slipped disk and numbness in my right leg due to it pinching on a nerve. So a career change is in motion I guess.which sucks because i was working so hard, I wanted to really get back into gaming to play things with my friends again. I miss having a computer and I doubt I'll be able to afford one any time this year or the next which sucks because PC gaming is the only way I was able to ever connect with my friends halfway across the country. I feel so cut off and so lonely. 

My partner isn't really understanding of my emotions. She yells at me anytime I start crying or when im having a panic attack. Which I guess is my fault for being a  stupid fucking idiot I don't work hard enough, I'm the one paying the bills and stuff for the most part so i try my best to make her happy but I guess I'm just useless most of the time. But I'm happy someone wants to be with me I guess. It's nice. 

Within that two year time frame since then, my father ended up having 2 heart attacks and a stroke and his health has rapidly declined. My mother's mental health has been rapidly declining as well and she is a previous heart attack Survivor so things are physically and emotionally too demanding on her. I haven't been able to go and even see.them because of covid travel restrictions. My father had to be ressusistacted once and shocked for a new developing AFib twice in the last two weeks And it sucks. And I hate myself for not leaving with my parents because they need me more than ever but it's not like I can just drop my whole life and go.

I have no friends. 
I don't talk to anyone. 
I barely eat. 
I have nightmares every night. 
I don't feel real.

I just try my best to do any gig work I can come home and try to do all the dishes and the laundry and mop and sweep and make dinner for the girlfriend so she doesn't get mad at me because I want her to be happy. 


I'm sad. I've lost my faith, religiously. Which has caused me to have such a pessimistic nihilist view on life. I feel like there is no purpose. The thought of the fact that I'm going to die is on my head 247 and I've never been the type of person to think about stuff like that.

I have thought about ending my life alot recently. No plans though. I guess it just comes with the emotions sometimes.

Whatever the case. There is alot more than this. I don't know how to explain everything going on. There's alot. I feel alone, I don't have my family, eveeyone here hates me. I'm never enough for the girlfriend. I cry every night. 

I'm not looking for anyones sympathy or anything. My head is just fucked up. I'm sorry for even occupying anyone's time with all this. I'm sorry for taking up a spot that someone else could have used to vent.

I hope you all have a beautiful and eventful, fruitful and productive start of your week this coming Monday. You are all amazing.

I’m fucking tired of feeling lonely and depressed. I barely sleep, I don’t eat anything at all and I struggle to get out of my bed and do my assignments in college. 

I’m suffering internally every single day, nothing brings me joy anymore. I’m pathetic, that’s why everyone I knew abandoned me and I deserve all the things that happened to me.

depression,"Life seems dull I don’t have a care for anything. School? I’m taking the quarter off supposedly to “find” myself. I was doing really shitty and have no clue where I want to go in life. I have no passions or desires. I’d rather sleep in all day. I prefer my dreams over reality. And when I do sleep +12 hours I’m even less inclined to do anything. But I only sleep so much because I’m genuinely tired. I hate everything about my life currently. I feel like I hate no priorities. Not only that I regret a lot of stuff. Which I am not going to lie it’s given me a lot of anxiety and I just keep beating myself over it. But then One day suddenly I wake up and I’m no longer in the dumps but it annoys me so much because I never know when I’m going to fall into the cycle again because I always do. I feel like I am at my highest, my lowest is coming soon which always turns my highs into lows. Overall I feel like a *uck up."
depression,"How can I explain to my partner that the depressed him isn't the real him and that he will recover? Hi r/depression,

Throwaway account here. I'm at a little bit of a loss at the moment, so I'm throwing this out to the void. My partner and I have been together for nearly nine months. He has been suffering from depression for the last two of those months. He's been through bouts of it before, long before I knew him, but has always pulled through.

When we first met and started dating he was chatty, vibrant, excitable, fun, and adventurous. He was excited about our future together and was deliriously happy that we were together, as was I - I've never loved anyone so much in my life, I consider him my soulmate and he has told me he feels the same way. 

Over the months of us being together I have seen his mental state decline, very slowly - he told me he has always struggled with bouts of bad feeling before, but this time it's lasting longer and seems to be getting worse.

At different times he has told me he doesn't feel real, that he can't feel things all the way - even things like eating, dressing, being touched. He feels like there's a veil between him and the rest of the world, and that I seem like a whole and functional person to him, and that he's just *not*. He also has a lot of issues around time and feels like it's slipping away constantly - he feels like he always has no time in the day to do anything. He has lost interest in his hobbies and just feels apathetic about almost everything. He doesn't speak to anyone about this apart from me, his mum occasionally, and his psychologist, who he only started seeing recently - and he has seemed to feel worse after every session.

He told me last night that he feels like a ghost of himself, completely different from who he was when we started dating, and that I'm in love with 'a ghost' and not the 'real him'.

This of course was incredibly heartbreaking to hear, but I've been trying to convince him that just because he feels like a different person to who he was then, doesn't mean that he is. I've suffered from depression (admittedly it was mild, and in high school) and chronic anxiety myself, and so have members of my family, and I have a lot of friends who have - most have said that depression skews your thought process and makes you feel like nobody understands you and that you're a different, disconnected person, but it's not true. 

I've just spent about an hour reading about depression making people fall out of love and crying because I'm scared that's going to happen with him. He's already been telling me that he feels like it's not fair for him to keep me around and that I deserve better. I absolutely intend to support him through this and be there for him as long as he wants me, and have told him as much, but I'd be lying if I said that this didn't scare me.

Does anyone have any advice or can relate to the feelings he's experiencing, and could give me advice for how to support him through this and remind him that this is just how he feels right now?"
depression,"I can’t anymore I’m sick of always feeling like shit all the time I have major depression disorder(MDD) my meds aren’t helping whatsoever and I know I have supportive friends and family, but that doesn’t matter how seemingly great your life is. I am grateful for every single person in my life. I’m never going to be happy it seems and I feel like just ending it at times, but I don’t want anyone to be sad, I wish no one cared so it’d be easier. I’ve always cared and loved and just gone out of my way for others and every little thing someone close to me does that seems off affects me. I wish I just didn’t care or no one else did so I could pass swiftly."
depression,"Maybe end it. I’m back here. I mean knew it was going to happen. But I was hoping I would not have to come back for a bit longer.   

I was in a great mood the last few days. I had stuff to do. Tasks to complete. Research a few things. Today I had nothing to do. Yet I continued with the research and went deep into it. 

But. Now here I am sitting in a corner of my room. Not knowing what I want. I know I want to change my life. But I can’t leave my parents behind. I want to end it all, but thinking of how it will affect my friends stops me in my tracks. 

No one understands me. No one is there for me. There is nothing I can do. Because it is my fault. I choose to alone, but I am lonely. But I can’t deal with people either. I am a joke of a human. I am no social being. 

Why do I live.? 

To love.? I don’t know how to...

To have a married life.? I can’t be with one person for too long. I want to be alone

To have kids.? I don’t want to project my mental issues onto them..

Only option is to run away and continue this horrible life.

Or 

End it all."
depression,"Is it me or... Do you ever just remember what you’ve done or said in the past and it makes you want to kill yourself because you don’t want to associate yourself with the person you used to be?

I wasn’t exactly in the right mindset in the beginning of the year, but I know I can’t change time. I feel like a piece of shit for just spouting absurd things and being unable to accept things. I guess I’m just embarrassed of myself.

I feel like therapy has been helping me be a better person. However, I also have issues apologizing to those I’ve hurt; I’m just so afraid that they’ll hate me anyways. I know I can’t control how people react, so why am I like this?

Last night, I remembered about the people I’ve hurt and cut deep into my thighs as a punishment for myself. I tried cutting into my right thigh as I’ve never cut there, but I only felt a sharp pang and then nothing. I just feel empty and dead inside, which is typical. But, I hate feeling like this so much. I feel stupid for feeling like this. My friend tried asking me to find a different way to cope other than cutting and I couldn’t think of anything that would be as relieving as cutting.

I get a really bad feeling in my gut when I think about my past. I hate myself so much. Why can’t I just be normal like everyone else and just be upfront. I get panic attacks when someone mentions a person I’ve hurt before. I’m just tired of being scared and I want to fix things, but I’m extremely terrified.

So maybe, one day, I will be able to apologize in a proper way to everyone."

I don't want to talk abot it with anyone i know because i don't deserve to be depressed, and everything thats bad with my life is my fault, so i'm not posting it in my normal accout so no one i know will somehow see it.

You don't have to tell me how good my life is, and that i'm only a kid and don't know what real depression is, and that my problems don't reach half of most people's here, i already know that.

That one person that actually listens to my problems and helps me solve them but in return he or she can also tell me their problems so i can help.

I could live on a pack of smokes for 2 weeks. Now it doesn’t last four days and I’m left with nothing until my next pay day where it just repeats. 
I can’t afford anything nice because it gets taken. 

Drives my car and doesn’t fill gas or oil. I literally feel worthless and used and suicidal because I’d sooner kill myself than continue being mistreated. Is it normal to constantly feel like an unwanted visitor in your own home?

So a little back story about me. 

I am a 25 year old gay male. All my life I have had trouble making friends. In school I was either bullied, ignored or treated like I was some kind of weirdo despite me giving my best effort to be nice to people. The times when people would regularly talk to me and be somewhat nice It would seem as if they always had other friends they preferred better and i never really had any close friendships.  I remember one day my junior year of high school I decided to not talk all day and see if anybody noticed. They didn't. 

My relationship with my parents was always great especially with my mother who was my best friend. My father was great too. However they both died unexpectedly of surprise medical issues when I was 20 and 23. 

I had a job which was a horrific experience. I had to file a lawsuit against the company I worked for, which I won. I have not had another job or haven't really had any desire to look for once again since. 

Anyways after all this I was pretty much all alone in the world. I don't really have much family either. So I decided to join a few dating apps. 

I was on all the popular ones ( tinder, meetme, grindr, etc.) for a while and wasn't having much luck. Until one day I got a message from a profile on grindr that had no picture. I noticed it was a young man not too far from me who was 19 at the time. We started talking and honestly he was the first person I've had a good conversation with in a long time. We exchanged pictures and we thought we were each attractive. 

We talked for like two months before we met as I was kind of afraid to meet anybody due to my social anxiety. But one night we agreed to meet and it was literally the best time of my life. It was the first time anyone had shown a sincere interest in me and he stayed the night at my house and even took me out for breakfast the next morning. This made me really happy.

After this we would text and or call every day and we would see each other at least 2 or 3 times a week. Sometimes he would stay at my house for days. Things were going so great. He was the sweetest person I had ever met and it would literally make me smile every time I would hear his text notification. I was falling for him quite fast. One morning after he had stayed the night at my house again I told him that I loved him. He said it back. I was so happy. 

Anyways after about two months of us talking and texting all the time and seeing each other often, he calls me one day and says that his mom and stepdad are going to kick him out if he can not pay them $200 a week to live in their house. He asks if he can move in with me and I said yes. I was so happy that I wouldn't be alone anymore and that I'd have my favorite person with me every day. 

Things were going great until late December 2019. Our first problem was that he wanted to call and talk to one of his friends ( he only has two friends, they are a married couple in their mid 20s from his old job) and he talked to her on speakerphone. During the conversation he asks her what her and her husbands plans for new years are. He then attempts to make plans with them and he says to his friend on the phone that he isn't going to bring me. After the phone call I asked him why he didn't ask me what I wanted to do for new years and he said he didn't think I'd mind. And I explained to him that I wasn't ready to meet his friends yet and that I wanted it to be just us on new years and the next thing I know he's angry and yelling and screaming at me. 

Then Christmas comes. He spends an entire week with his family ( including his mom and stepdad who just kicked him out) while I sat at home alone. He made no attempt to include me even if he wasn't ready to tell his family about our relationship he could've at least included me somehow. I told him how I didn't want to spend Christmas alone and his answer was "" most people spend Christmas with their family "" and I tried to explain to him that I can't really do that as most of my family members are dead and he says "" that's unfortunate"" 

New years comes and his friends end up not getting back to him on their new years plans so he spends new years with me. 

Later on he says he wants a pet snapping turtle and wants me to feed it while he's going to be gone on a then upcoming one week vacation with his mother which I wasn't invited on and I said something on the lines of "" I'd prefer you get it after your vacation is over so you can take care of it "" and he starts yelling and screaming and says if he can't have his turtle he's moving out and breaking up with me. 

Okay so at this point I'm tired of typing so I'll sum up the rest of the relationship until our breakup 

January 2020. His mother plans a vacation to las vegas. I notice I am not invited. We argue several times about this. I eventually tell him if I'm not invited I don't want him to go. He said he's still going and He then says "" im not going to ruin my relationship with my family just because you're a little upset "" 
- January 2020. He says he might have to move out and in with his step brother because his step brother has an apartment and his room mate is potentially moving out. He said if his step brother says he can move in he has to do it because he doesn't want to upset him. Step brother later tells him he doesn't want him moving in.
- February 2020. I catch him on snapchat talking to an ex fling. We argue about this. He claims they were talking about business. Which is a bullshit excuse 
- February 2020. I meet his two friends from his old job ( the same ones from the new years drama) I didn't care much for them. He said I am a horrible person and deserve to die because I don't like them since they've never done anything to me. These two friends have literally no redeeming qualities what so ever but he will defend them with his life despite them not even texting him back most of the time and they have stood him up before multiple times 
- march 2020. I am finally invited to go to las vegas with him and his mother. We go and have a good time.
- march 2020. He orders the parts and puts together a gaming pc. He then starts to play video games for multiple hours every day limiting the amount of time we spend together. We argue sometimes about this. 
- April 2020. I ask him to do something other than play the games for a night. I get choked. 
- may 2020. Arguing about the gaming continues. 
- may 2020. He gets a new car. We are out doing something in the part of town his dad lives in. He said he wants to show his dad the car but he is afraid of what his dad will say to/ about me. So he asks if he can drop me off at a nearby gas station and stand inside until he's done showing it to dad. I refuse and we argue. 
- June 2020. We get into one random argument one night about his friends again because at this point he makes it seem like he's going out of his way to talk to them in front of me as much as possible. Once we even tried to cuddle and he randomly gets his phone out and messages one of them on Instagram in the process. Everything seems fine after that. 
- June 2020 the next day. He comes home from work early. Everything seems fine. A few minutes later he informs me his dad and grandfather are coming to help him move out and they're bringing the police with them to ensure everything goes smoothly. Later that night he tells me that he told his dad about the arguement we had and his dumbass dad thought for some reason I had been assaulting him. Which I wasn't. So his dad tells him to move out and he is too scared of daddy not to or to even tell him that I wasn't assaulting him. His dad even wanted him to press charges against me for literally nothing. 
- late June 2020. I receive a random phone call from him one night asking if I will come have sex with him because I'm the only person he can get "" turned on"" for. After this he decides he wants to be friends. 

Anyways after this we are still friends and talk every day. Sometimes he is the sweet nice boy that I once knew and miss so much and other times he is a complete asshole. He still is trying to hold onto that friendship that he ruined our relationship over with those two losers and gets mad if I ever say anything about them. He said one time a few months ago that I am the best looking guy he can get as people usually don't find him attractive. 

There have been times I've wanted to just quit talking to him and I've tried to but every time he does something to pull me back in. He knows he is the only person I have to talk to and I think he is trying to use that to his advantage. 

I feel like if I do stop talking to him I would be alone again and have no luck finding anybody else and I don't want to go through that but I know that he is a total waste of time. 

I don't understand why he has always liked those two useless friends of his over me despite me doing literally anything he's said for a year and them only ever talking to him when it's convenient for them and doing nothing for him. He is also very afraid of his family for reasons I have yet to figure out. He has always acted insane over his friends and scared to death of his family especially his father. 

I don't even know what to do now. I don't want to be alone but then I don't want to keep having my time wasted with him. After all this how can I even trust anybody else. Idk. I'm just confused."

depression,Life is weird Friends come and go.  They get married.  They move.  You never see them again.  Loved ones die.  Then you’re left holding the bag again. It hurts.  You want some affection but you’re no good with women.  Women don’t want a passive pussy.  Life goes on and on.  Endless loop of misery with tiny bits of hope mixed in to fool you.

depression,"help i feel so deprived. i’m just sleeping in bed listening to music that hits my heart at home. In my life, i’ve always been there for anyone and any time to help them grow. I feel like i’m drowning and no one is saving me even when I’m at my last breath every night. everyone tells me about their feelings and that’s why people love me sometimes for but everyday, people have never truly cared about me. i know they pretend to or just brush my life off, but do I only have my parents? my brother just called me dumb like a million times which generally hurt my heart because i’ve been dumb in high school which really triggers my past. i know anyone can just “care” but they really don’t give a shit and go in with their lives. i’m just glad i have my parents as my best friends because i used to remember crying alone in school everyday at a single spot then coming home to my lovely mother who heard me for 5 hours. there’s really no one to hear my breath out there. like i honestly you know am just going to help them with whatever and you know what—just let myself die. i think y’all would think they care but i don’t give a shit it’s best for me to just slowly suffocate and sink by myself. i know i could take self help as everyone could say “you did this to yourself” but fuck anyone out there because i can sense fake care which is all my friends basically either using me or my time or thoughts. i would like to thank everybody for letting me drown while i tried to hint that i’m drowning but still. all my friends keep going on with their life so who gives a shit even if i help them a lot—no one will help me. thank you for everyone who didn’t see me or check up on me and thank you mom a d dad for working so damn hard for my brothers and my lonely life. if i ever try it’ll be temporary."
depression,"Finally quitting I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. In third grade I wrote a letter to my mom explaining how I just wanted to die. I never thought I’d make it out of high school but I only did because i smoked weed everyday all day. It was the only thing that made this hole in my chest go away and allowed me to think straight. But I just moved from Phoenix to Clarksville TN and I’m quitting but everything is coming back, the emptyness, the pain, the greyness of everything. My parents don’t want me to smoke so they’re determined that I quit but so far it’s the only thing other than cutting that’s made me feel better. I’m just tired and I’m not sure how long I’d be able to live like this again."

Nobody knows I'm struggling, and it's so difficult to get through this. I have a test tomorrow, an essay in 5 days, and assignments to complete. I don't need my classmates constantly giving me weird looks when I did badly, or chose not to do my work. You guys have no idea what I'm going through. If only I'm able to drop out of college. It sucks being forced to attend college.

depression,"I hate how some people respond when you talk about being depressed A common response I’ve noticed when opening up about depression is “I think a lot of people/I experience stuff like that too, it’s not that uncommon”. I get that it comes from a place of wanting you to not feel alone but most people just throw this out as a first response.

And if everyone experiences that same emotion and that would mean that the only difference is how you handle it. It also takes focus away from my feelings. If I’m opening up to you about how I feel, trivializing or taking away focus from those feelings won’t make me feel better.

I know that it’s not anyone’s job to talk to me about these sort of things but it still makes me incredibly frustrated to continuously have to deal with this."

If I were to describe how I feel without making it a very long post, I would say, paradoxes. I want to get better, but I don't want to take medicine. I want a girlfriend/friend, but I am afraid to get close, and don't even know how. I hate depression, yet it seems like I deliberately draw myself closer to it by various, mildly self-destructive tools. I truly want a good life, but I don't even see myself living even until 30. I want to live, yet I imagine myself randomly dying a shooting, getting hit by a bus or other horrible things.

depression,Sometimes want to cry but feel compressed ? Why can I just let it out ?
depression,"Acceptance (long, but well written I promise) I've spent most of my life unhappy with the way things are: my looks, my body, my family, my schooling, my social skills. Ever since I was a child, I've distracted myself through TV, video games, food, books, and when I was especially young: playing make believe with my toys and action figures. These things all took me away from experiencing life as myself and accepting the fact that I'm not the same as every happy, healthy, and sociable person.

I carried these habits throughout high school, although then, I did have a good friend group. I made a good reputation amongst them for being the easy going and positive one. What no one knew was that I often felt disassociated from everyone. I never really felt like I was an actual person with equal value in their lives. I spent most of my time then playing video games and fantasizing about living a life where I was more successful and popular. I also fantasized about being in a loving relationship, mostly through listening to roleplay audios.

My junior year, I met my first girlfriend. Funny enough, she was the one first interested in me first. We got together, and were seen as the best couple from our friends. Looking back on it, she was dealing with getting over another guy who wasn't treating her well, so she saw me as her escape from that, and her ""Prince Charming"" basically. We rode off of the initial infatuation for a while, for me it was the fact that I'd finally found love with someone, for her it was that she finally found the right guy, the perfect guy to make her life right. Eventually, we had our arguments, and I realized that she didn't really care for me as a person, she expected me to be perfect and always lift her up. When it came to her problems, I had to always be right at her side, listening to her feelings without offering too much of a solution, because she needed the emotional support above all. When it came to mine, I was always given direct solutions accompanied by words that made me feel dumb for having issues. There was hardly any emotional support. When I was dealing with binge eating it was always ""why don't you just get a normal eating schedule"" instead of ""It's okay, talk to me about why you've been doing this"". When I was struggling in college it was always ""just go and get help"" instead of  ""you're good enough to make it through, I believe in you"". Then I was always being compared to other guys, it made me always feel like she would leave me for someone else if she felt like she was good enough. We were together for two years, and during that time I always did things for her, bought things for her, and always tried to have special or intimate moments even if they didn't always work out. We also had many inside jokes and I goofed around and acted silly often, just because I loved making her laugh and seeing her smile. Eventually, she decided that I wasn't good enough for her. Maybe I wasn't attractive enough, man enough, or I didn't have as good of a career prospect. She cut off communication with me and found another guy to be her Prince Charming, and start this cycle of dependency again. When she found out that he didn't actually care about her, she came back to me for emotional support. Things went on for another few months. Then again, she cut off communication with me and found a guy that she thought was better, and who knows how long this cycle will last. All I can say is that I won't be providing emotional support for her to fall back on when it inevitably ends.

I say all of this because now I'm 19. I dropped out of college, I'm not a very attractive guy (naturally chubby guy, soft and round structure, plus a relatively small penis) and I don't feel like I have anything going for me in regards to attracting a woman. As you've read though, a relationship is obviously a valuable thing to me. 

Just to make sure you're on track, the main theme here is that I've had all these visions and expectations for what I want for my life, though things go against me in achieving that, so I instead spend time living vicariously through social media, books, TV, porn, and other forms of fantasizing, while still taking care of my business the best I can when I'm out in the world. This is all while hoping that one day I'll wake up, and I'll be in the perfect body living the perfect life, which as you can imagine, kept me in a constant state of depression, frustration, and hopelessness.

TLDR: I guess my point for all of this is, and I don't know if Im just regurgitating whatever blank-pilling mentality there is out there- it's okay to be sad about your situation, and it's okay to be depressed about the way things are. It's okay to accept that life isn't fair and it deals people bad cards in many ways, but we shouldn't become so fixated on thinking we would be happier if something was different, or if we were someone else, or if we can one day start being happy. We have to do all that's in our power to do, and accept that some people are given better paths in life, and we can find content in our own path and alleviate this pressure of comparison and desire.

TLDR for the TLDR: I basically vent and then try to make a wholesome point, while realizing that the message may not actually be there, or be a good one, and I probably just have some problematic world views."

I feel like a fucking loony for sitting here in my bedroom at nearly 5am(had to edit that twice while writing) laughing at the absurdity of life after a shroom trip.
I don't even know how to state this without seeming hypocritical. Here I am asking for advice without being judged yet if I were to read this myself I'd think it's from some deranged person or a lonely neckbeard.

Basically, the only thing stopping me from improving my life is myself.

For the longest time, I was heavily depressed. My interests and hobbies morphed into ways to simply get through the day. There was no passion for anything; no will to live.
As a result of this I obviously stopped caring about my appearance and allowed myself to gain a lot of weight. 

This is what I had always envisioned of depression. This state of hopelessness. When you are here, there is nothing anyone can tell you to make it better, because you they can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves.
I'm not sure if I'd even call this a mental illness. In retrospect, it all seems very logical to me.

Most people have some sense of purpose. Stuff like companionship, wealth, providing for a dependent, or feeling like you want to make a difference.
I thought of people I know. Some people only cared about money and their personal well-being and others were the polar opposite who put society over personal gain.
So why is it so crazy to think that a person exists that doesn't care about any of those categories? Is it a mental illness for not having a reason to continue? Why and how?


Anyways, about a year ago I found a purpose. I found a reason to seek greater education and companionship. However, I thought my appearance was an obstacle holding me back from achieving either. At the time I had very low self-esteem from what I let myself become. I spent many months improving my physique and I'd like to think I've overcame my self-esteem issues.
I feel like I am above average in terms of attractiveness, semi-intelligent, and I no longer feel down about comparing my progress in life to others.

So why is it so fucking hard to do anything that would benefit me as a person? There's nothing holding me back but myself, yet I'm not going anywhere.
For the first time in my life I have goals and ambitions and can't think of a single thing holding me back. Yet I'm making zero progress. I always thought depression was the lack of wanting to do anything and thought I was out of it by finding a purpose. But now, even with a purpose, it's overwhelmingly difficult to accomplish anything. 

I needed to improve my high school grades to apply to university so I joined some continuing education classes. The problem is that these are self-paced and it's so easy to let myself get distracted or fall into a pit of procrastination without any deadlines. Everyone says I should ""make deadlines for myself"" but how the fuck do those work if I can freely push them back without punishment?
This applies to everything in life. Why can't I accomplish anything without any external pressure? Why do I need a punishment to improve? I feel like a person should be capable of this yet I'm not.

Also, I know everyone is self-diagnosing themselves with ADHD these days and shit. I read into it a lot, and I mean A LOT. I genuinely believe I have it and got a proper diagnoses. I'm currently taking Conerta, which does help me focus sometimes, but doesn't provide motivation or focus on what's important if that makes any sense.

Thanks for listening to my TED Talk or whatever. I'm gonna try to catch some sleep tonight but I'll read comments in the morning(or afternooon I guess) if there are any."

I grew up feeling like a failure to my parents, especially when I had Bs or Cs isntead of As. I have practically no self esteem and I often put myself down and joke about my insecurities and mental health problems (usually I straight up saying that I want to die)

Note: My mom also made me feel bad about my introverted personality.

Note2: Also, my emotions are sometimes like a rollercoaster. One moment I'm happy but then sad/tired.

it was silly to fall in love. i knew i would never be enough. i knew it would hurt more than anything at the end. i knew i couldnt keep up. i knew i couldnt handle anyone's expectations.

sometimes i wish it hurt more. enough to actually kill me.

i am tired of being alive.

it's not like i wasn't still depressed when we were together. but there was light in my life.

i miss that."
depression,"Is being happy just not wanting to die? I’m not sure if this is the best sub to post this but I’ve been going through a bit of a couple of rough patches these past couple of years. Every other month hits hard and there’s always a voice in the back of my head that whittles me down every day. 

The only time when I’m happy?? is when I’m distracting myself like playing games or talking to my friends online. When I’m done, I’m always back to thinking I’m not really worth anyone’s time. Kind of like that one episode of Bojack Horseman where we hear his inside voice telling him he’s a piece of shit. 

Is this normal? I don’t really want to end it myself, but thinking of being in a state where you don’t have to do/feel anything feels like a fantasy. I’m feel like I’m getting closer each day to the edge and some days it’s harder than others. 

Does this happen to anyone else? If so, how do I deal with it?"
depression,"Shouldn't I be happy if I love myself? I used to hate myself and I would blame myself for everything bad that happened. I was able to overcome that hate and now I can say I love myself. I think I'm healthy, dedicated, responsible... And I love that I can be this determined with my life, but I'm still unhappy, even tho I've tried for years now, I tried changing my mindset, I try to change everything to love myself and be happy.

I thought that if I loved myself I would be default be happy, but most of the days I'm just so depressed. So there is my question ""Shouldn't I be happy if I love myself?"" or am I just helpless?"
depression,I have turned into such a hateful person Recently I have come to realisation that I'm not who I once used to be. I used to be nice to everyone and caring but I feel that because these traits got me nowhere and everyone took advantage of me so it just changed. Now I just seek revenge and wish the most horrible things upon everyone who has ever done or tried to do me wrong and I will do everything in my power to make them suffer like I did. People hate me now but all I can think of is how it was the same in my past for whatever reason. At least now no one can use me anymore

depression,"Everything is just screwed. I don't know if I really have depression, and I am afraid to test door it. I have been sad for like 2 months. This all has to trace back to about 5 years ago when I was in primary 5. That time I was an strange person, so I didn't have many friends. That time I was in a playgroup and there was this one person that was my best, and only friend. Then, he moved to another district and can no longer attend the playgroup. Then my pet turtle, which was my only ""friend"" at that time, died. This made me just mentally ""lost"" as I have nothing to rely on. No one to speak to, no one to support me. Then"

I don't like being alone. I don't like forcing people for attention it's a middle ground where I'm stuck. Do I have a problem? And as the title says is nighttime depression a thing?"

Every time that they talk to me I feel like their doing it for mercy and that they don't really care.

depression,"1 + 1 = 2 = Our Educational System Ought to be Considered Leading Cause of Depression Do a quick Google search... What causes depression and what can help relieve some of the symptoms?

GET SOME SLEEP - Teens and young adults need up to 12 hours of sleep as they are going through a vital development stage. So, let's wake them all up at the crack of fucking dawn and keep them in school until it's almost time for dinner, and don't forget to give them homework too so they don't have time for...

RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES - You can either forego the activities you enjoy our cut the time out of your sleep schedule! Great! Not to mention many extracurriculars get defunded or dropped entirely.

EXERCISE / SPORTS - Not only are many school not requiring gym, but a lack of funds means sports teams are being dissolved in an instant.

EAT HEALTHY MEALS - I'm SuRe EvErY PaReNt MaKeS ThEiR kId A wElL rOuNdEd bReAkFaSt AT 6 IN THE MORNING ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. Not to mention the fact that pizza, chicken nuggets, and sloppy joes are excellent sources of all vital nutrients... 

STAY SOCIAL - With numerous extracurriculars being cancelled or defunded, it's much more challenging to find social groups.

GET SOME SUN - Super easy when you spend 6-8 hours a day in a brick building. 🙄

LET YOURSELF BE VULNERABLE - Good luck not being singled out and bullied relentlessly by others your age (often coping with similar feeling to yours in a violent way). Not to mention, if you're lucky, your teachers will make fun of you to and tell you there's no excuse for you to be depressed of falling behind.

SET GOALS - You only have time for academics and maybe a party time job or hobby. It's endlessly difficult to attain goals at a teen or young adult as you're forced to chase better grades or a better job to the point all you crave is not to fail.



This generation is being treated like shit and being told we don't have the right to be depressed when our EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM VIOLATES OUR DEVELOPING BRAINS in an attempt to win a rat race for more funding. Yeah, they have out suicide hotline cards, but they refuse to take any action to PREVENT DEPRESSION IN SCHOOLS AND IN THE LONG TERM.

YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE DEPRESSED, AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO SEEK HELP. YOU'RE NO LESS VALUABLE THAN THE IGNORANT ""SUPERIORS"" WHO TELL YOU THE OPPOSITE."
depression,"I'm officially alone. I did it. I cut the last person out of my life. I love them so much, so it was hard. What hurt the most wasnt the fact that i won't be able to speak to them again, but rather the fact that they were compliant and made it obvious they didn't care if we stopped talking because they hate me. 
I can officially take my life now and cause nobody problems."
depression,"Its getting worse. I used to be able to forget for a little bit, but I can't anymore. It's gotten to the point to where I shut down in public, I put in my earbuds and just exist. I add in nothing, I don't speak, I don't project,  I only feel.

I feel the weight of my own reality crumbling. My own existence in life fading as I become more detached from reality. The only thing left that I have is my sensitivity, the part about me that I hate.

If I don't talk to people, they won't get hurt, if I don't let people know my feelings, they won't exist. Situations and hypothetical conversations are always playing in my head, constantly reminding me that it won't actually happen. No one wants a loser who is always in his head and has nothing to add. He always just ignores what everyone else wants and does whatever is most beneficial to him.

And I guess it will be true till the end."

depression,"Weed and Intrusive thoughts?  

# Weed and intrusive thoughts?

📷

Never been diagnosed with OCD. Only depresson and A.D.D

When I was a teenager (now in my late 20's) After smoking large amounts of weed and having some drinks, I got a raging erection which is normal as a 16 year old after smoking pot. I began getting what I thought and still hope were unwanted intrusive thoughts of the sexual kind. No matter how much I tried to fight the thoughts it just kept coming and coming, horrifying experience especially because these thoughts weren't getting rid of my erection. I felt no attaction to the thoughts and kept pausing and saying wtf this is gross and then an aggresive thought would come in ""NO YOU DO WANT IT ""It was a very weird incident. I ended up masturbating that incident ruined my entire f\*\*\*\*ng life. I have been an anxious wreck since then, almost 15 years now, no gf, no sex life, i used to be barely able to hold a job. At the age of 23 said enough is enough and went to a doctor who prescribed me an SSRI. The meds gave me hope, I felt like a brand new person, my anxiety disappeared I was able to get good jobs and was able to be social without looking like a nervous wreck all the time. Now the meds seem to have stopped working and I am very depressed. I cant get out of bed in the morning to go to work my anxiety is that bad. The meds helped me for 5 years and they basically made me forget about anything negative. Now im back to reality and cant understand why I masturbated that night to such unwanted, sickening thoughts. Makes me want to cry everyday and I am beginning to feel very suicidle even though Im too much of a wuss to actually do it.

anybody wish to chime in? im such a mess right now."
depression,"How can I switch to happiness I remain mostly sad. By mostly I mean, only when I am occupied by a movie or social media I don't think I am sad as I am not thinking about myself at that point. When I am alone or have nothing to do, I feel so depressed that I look at my ceiling fan and fantasize about hanging myself. I don't like to go outside, or, talk, or, get a job. I am 28 and feel it's too late now to achieve anything substantial in life."
depression,"Partner discourages me from taking depression naps At first they were surprised that I started napping and then it became annoyance, and then it became action when they'd force me to wake up and told me I'd stop napping if I took initiative to be active.

They've always been a nagger and I also want to acknowledge how tired I get from my work. Due to the nature of my profession, I'm forced to use additional hours after work to get things done (daily - weekends too) and the output of what I put in is not even bare bones: I just get more complaints and entitlement.

Taking naps reenergizes me and gives me a bit of energy to deal with my unfortunate life for the rest of the day. Now I don't even get to do that."
depression,"Short version I’ve now lost both my parents one in 91 and one this year , and am very depressed. My grown child is an alcoholic who refuses help. They live with me because I can’t give up on them , my parents never gave up on me. I overthink everything and feel like I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I feel lost and don’t know what to do anymore! I try to be strong and will always say I’m ok but I’m not and don’t even know where to turn for help."
depression,"I have tons of responsibilities, both ethical and day-to-day, and I can’t fulfill any of them. There’s a lot going on I’m overwhelmed. I’m trying to donate to people in need online, avoid awful businesses, do well in school, eat healthily (my dad can only eat 200mg of sodium a day) and post about important topics on social media. I don’t have a steady income, either, yippee. 

If I don’t donate, I’m selfish. If I drop a class, I’m a quitter. If I delete social media, I’m benefitting from privilege and enabling injustice. I want to wear more feminine clothes (I’m technically a boy, hooray), but I want to shop sustainably, which means I’m only buying secondhand - shocker, most of it doesn’t fit, making me feel huge. I feel paralyzed - every I do (and don’t) has some sort of awful result.

It’s 2AM and I feel like someone just injected adrenaline directly into my heart. I’m not sleepy at ALL. Sleep doesn’t happen as much anymore. I just don’t want people to think I’m a bad person. I want to talk to my mom, but I’m 18, and yet, it’s like I want to be joined at the hip with her. I know it has less to do with her and more to do with the sense of safety/security she’s given me since childhood, but still. I’m weak.

does anyone else here talk to themselves a *lot*? I feel crazy. I’ll shut the door after talking to a neighbor and just start muttering “you’re ok you’re ok you’re ok you’re ok you can do it you can do it you’re selfish you’re selfish stop it please someone help me mommy just die die please someone help”....I know that’s a wall of text but if anyone does anything remotely like that I’ll feel a lot better.

Lastly (and this is a LGBT thing, so stop reading if ur not cool w it) - I have very low hopes for my love life. Presenting femme is something I want to do, but I’m balding (traction alopecia!) and not sure if I wanna get on E &amp; change my name.  I told my friend “my brother will have a wife &amp; kids by age 30 and I’ll just be the lonely tranny” as a joke, but then began sobbing."
depression,"I finally reached a personal goal of mine after 3 years of procrastination and having barely any energy I've been wanting to learn Korean for fun, so I got a few textbooks on it and I finally finished the second textbook out of 3 after 3 long years! It's a pretty big achievement for me because 3 years ago is when I also started becoming more depressed and then began having trouble with doing everyday things like brushing my teeth and eating, so when I stopped having the motivation to eat, I sure as hell stopped having the motivation to study.

It has been an emotionally and mentally tough 3 years, but I'm glad I finally finished 40 full lessons total. On to the third and final textbook I go (and hopefully it won't take another 3 years)! Wish me luck"

depression,Not again 😭😭 Not me playing the sims and creating perfect families to make up for the pain and sadness I feel on the daily from my broken and dysfunctional family. 🙂
depression,I just need to talk about my past and try to cope with my mental illness I grew up where I watched my older sister get beaten by my mother everyday and my sister would beat me and I let her because I wanted her to get her pain out. Eventually my mother left me and my younger brothers for a guy and a new family. After a couple years she showed back up and swore up and down she was better and she regret what she did so my brothers and I decided to try and live with her again. She started stealing my money when I got my paychecks and spent it on her self and would leave for days on end and leave us no food and on the verge of getting evicted we eventually left and throughout all this I’ve been dealing with my depression that I was diagnosed with when I was younger. I just feel numb now. I don’t want to get up in the morning and all I want to do is kill myself. I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep dreaming about it. And recently I’ve been feeling relieved when I think about giving up killing myself. I’m so tired of feeling so numb.
depression,"Not there yet but on my way Hello,

The past few months I've been feeling like shit. I hate my partner, who makes me hate myself. I can't leave them because I feel like I have no friends or anyone who would understand me. I have no motivation to study, to to work out, or do anything remotely productive. I go on social media and I feel like people either dislike me, or don't care about me, which makes me dislike myself even more. 

I just hate myself and I don't know why. I keep asking myself why I made dumb decisions that have led me to feel this isolated. I hate that I need people and I hate that I don't have them either. And the circle just completes itself till I do nothing and feel nothing all day except the moments that go fron self-hate to self-pity and the inbetween rationalisations.

Mostly the issue is feeling nothing. It's all so dulled down. I used to feel everything intensely and now I'm not even anxious anymore. I just know I feel unhappy-but I don't feel it intensely. It's like a dull ache that's just there under the surface. I don't know how to change my life or turn things around to feel how I used to, or feel something different for a change. 

I don't know if I'm depressed. I just feel useless and unimportant. I was a reasonably sociable, productive person and I feel like events have shaped me into someone I hate being. I think too much, I over analyse, I feel guilty and controlled by my partner but maybe it's not even them making me feel this way and it's all in my head.

I hate old friends who left me, My partner shit talks attempts I make at trying to rebuild my life and be friendly with new people. She had a traumatic experience when her ex blew up her social life and prefers to live more reclusively and I feel guilty when I try to branch out or do things for myself. I'm called selfish, and maybe I am?

My mind isn't working the best and I wanted to get it out somewhere. I don't have many people to talk to so this is better than nothing. If anyone has read this ramble so far I have to thank you."
depression,"Don’t even know what to do anymore I’ve never made a post like this before, but I’m just overwhelmed with these feelings hopelessness, the paralyzing fear of never getting my shit together and always living in this limbo. It’s almost 3am, I’m supposed to be up in four hours and I’m wide awake plagued by these thoughts. I had to leave bed and go downstairs so I could sob without waking up my partner which made it all feel even more lonely and miserable (he usually wants me to wake him when I’m feeling like this so he can support me but I’d just feel too guilty knowing he has to be up in a few hours as well and had to be well rested for work). So now I’m just laying on my couch after a bout of sobbing. 

I’ve never been diagnosed with depression but I just didn’t know where else to post something like this. I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. Support maybe? To feel less alone? Idk, I write my thoughts and feelings out often enough so I recognize that it’s definitely helpful but I’ve never really been one to post this sort of stuff. I guess I just really felt the need to. 

I feel like the life just continues to drain out of me more and more quickly. I feel like more and more weight is being added to my shoulders each day. I feel so much fear and anxiety that I’ll never be stable or confident or in a place where I feel really good about myself and what I’m doing. How am I ever supposed to achieve anything if it’s such a fight to just pick my head up off the pillow or eat something or get dressed in the morning? How am I supposed to do things that make me passionate and excited in life when it feels like all of the passion has left my soul? I honestly don’t even have the mental energy to watch Netflix. My boyfriend will turn it on and I’ll be facing the back of the couch instead of watching, eyes open but not really seeing or processing anything, just glazed over as I stay deep inside my mind. 

I’ve tried to set goals, make lists, asked my bf to help be my accountability buddy, but I feel myself become less and less motivated each day and achieving those goals begin to matter less and less. Why does it matter if I do any one thing on any one given day if I can’t see myself achieving any larger goal or reaching any larger picture? I used to have the problem of having too many passions and interests and had paths to pick between but these past few months it’s all just continued to fade. 

Damn, as much as there’s just a fuckton on my mind and things making me miserable that I want to write out this post has already gotten a bit lengthy.

I’m so overwhelmed with these emotions. I just feel so miserable. If you’ve made it to the end thanks for taking the time to read through this rambling"
depression,"It seems that there isn't an end for my depression I feel numb about my life or anything. Sometimes I am laughing but I don't really feel the happiness. I act normal in front of my family, my friends and my ex-colleagues (I am jobless now lol), until today my mother found out my habit of hurting myself. We talked about this for the whole morning and both of us cried. I feel so guilty that I hurt her feelings. I feel so useless. But it is the only way for me to feel something or to be in less pain when I see the blood come out. I feel I have worked so hard to fight my depression by medication or going to therapist but there is no use. I am so tired."
depression,"Stuck, Lost, &amp; Tired I honestly don't know what to do anymore at this point in my life. I have undergone 10 years of therapy already and I still can't seem to heal from my childhood. I was molested and my mother knew it was happening but she did nothing. Like, how? How could you do nothing when you knew a 6-year-old was being molested? It makes it so difficult to have a relationship with either of my parents. At least my father would do stuff with me, go on trips and such, my mother just remained emotionally absent my entire childhood. I can't form relationships with anyone because I am terrified of being abandoned and of other's reactions to me sharing how I actually feel. Both of my parents were unpredictable in my childhood so I don't trust people in my adult life now. My father would abuse my mom in front of me and I would at times be abused too. I can't communicate to save my life and I overexplain things to make myself seem crazy so that I can sabotage my relationships and isolate myself further. I am terrified all the time. So much loss, I've been to so many funerals I've lost count. I've lost my childhood, my entire life because of the things that happened. Then being diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder last year was the icing on the cake. So not only do I have to deal with my issues but I have to deal with 10 other personalities and their problems. I can hear them talking to each other in my head all the time and it makes me feel like I'm insane. I'm terrified of truly opening myself up to someone completely and them telling me that I need to get help, that I need to go to the hospital. Well, guess what, I've been in and out of the hospital twice now and in therapy, for ten years, not to mention the 30+ medications I've been on. I don't have any hope left. I'm so tired. I don't even know if what I'm feeling anymore is depression. I literally feel so much that I don't feel anything at all. I can't help but think the only way out of my pain would be to die but I know I won't, can't do that. I'm honestly surprised I've made it this long. I once had a therapist tell me that too. How funny is that? I can say I'm hopeful about one thing. I'm hopeful of getting some disease or a freak accident killing me so I don't have to be here anymore and deal with this pain. But I guess I will suffer until then."
depression,Mental health To start off my mental when your the window so I helped my two best friend get together it Sounds good but what a mistake all they do I talk about each other and the one time I go to her for advice she blows t off like it’s nothing and I had a really bad panic attack that day im only to think that they have just forgot about me in conclusions  my mental health is gone
depression,"I'm really upset that my 21st year is wasted. I'm dealing with anger for the first time ever. Not even with COVID. Just mentally. 

I should be having the best, more jubilated, carefree year of my life. I work and do school like a normal person. But I'm horribly damaged psychologically and life is fucking unbearable. Severe PTSD from physical, psychological, sexual abuse and bullying, depression, anxiety, insomnia, OCD. And the worst part is, I'm becoming a bad person.

I used to at least be nice, I've been a self-centered asshole. Over the summer I got sexually assaulted and I spoke up to a ""friend"" about it who victim-blamed me and started a drama fiasco. She told me I wasn't sexually assaulted, she said such horrible shit to me. And I said horrible shit back.

I started talking to a girl and she falsely accused my friend of rape. She blocked me without saying anything and I was drunk and I really regret it even, though she is not a good person, I just went off on her. I'm an angry drunk.

I feel so horrible for being such a toxic person, especially to females. This isn't an incel post or anything. Both of these people crossed me and I lashed out and said shit to hurt their feelings. I won't apologize because they genuinely wronged me. But I'm just combative and argumentative now. I've become Jokeresque in a way. I'd never harm anyone. I am just extremely hateful and cynical and toxic and the state of the world makes it worse.

I feel like a horrible person. I want to fast forward to 22 and forget any of this ever happened. I've never said anything mean to anyone, ever. I let hate consume me.

I don't know what to do about this repressed rage I have. I don't know if anyone here has been toxic or vitriolic. I feel like Chaotic Evil. I want to be a good person even though life has been bad to me. I've never experienced this before.

depression,"I’m losing I’m a 23 years old female, diagnosed with PTSD and depression 10 years ago. My mental health was never OK, but for the last few months I just keep thinking about killing myself. I had to quit work, I can not pay attention at school and I keep ghosting my friends. My (now ex) boyfriend broke up with me last night because he can’t be there for me, the way I need. Everyday I’m thinking about taking my own life, assuming that this is the only way that will give me any comfort."
depression,"Where did my youth go? Anyone else feel like they spent their teenage years in a fugue state, just trying to survive from one day to the next?

I’m 22 now, I graduated from university over a year ago now and I’ve done nothing since then. I know 22 is still young, but so many people have achieved things by my ages. You read about bands who met at uni and writers who wrote their first book at 15, and I spent most of uni drinking and was just struggling to make friends at 15.

When I look back at all the time and opportunities I used to have, I can’t help but feel like I wasted them, even though I know that, at the time, I wasn’t well enough to take advantage of them.

How do you lot deal with this feeling?"
depression,"Interesting life lesson. Need to ramble a bit again.

So recently I got a vary interesting life lesson. I believe I have pinned the cause of my mental health issues to diet, but there are other situations that fuel my depression. I believe that the right food for me really does help me think and see things clearly, so I am improving one small step at a time. However there is something that has poisoned my mind the past year the most. I had a crush on a coworker, and she had a boyfriend. I was ok, I have crushes before not leading anywhere, but I found she has a crush on me too. So she left the BF and we started dating for a vary short time, but then she decided that she can't do this, and in time she went back to him, which only drove my mental health further down . She always told me that she likes me a lot, like no one before, and I was left with the impression she really did, and she went to her BF despite the fact that she liked me. I quit my job two months ago (not because of her originally, but it ended up this situation being a part of the decision), but we still talk from time to time, and she still says she thinks about me, she wants to see me, and I was going nuts thinking ""Why is she with him, when she likes me so much"". So I confronted her, pushed her to give me a reason, and she started listing things why she likes him, why she likes me, but eventually, she said it short and to the point ""Well maybe I don't like you that much"". And I felt so stupid, not because she didn't like me or not, nobody choose who they like, but because I didn't see it, and probably would have never saw it unless she or someone else told it to me. The problem was in with the question in my head also. ""Why is she with him, when she likes me so much"" the answer is in the question it self, and being so mentally challenged recently I couldn't see it. So I wondered how many questions are poisoning my mind, that I can't see the answer because it's the simplest answer imaginable or I block it with a question like the above that excludes the answer altogether. I did found some not so important questions and I will probably find a lot more as I continue. And I plan to shorten and make the questions a lot simpler. So it will be ""Why is she with him?""  ""Oh, maybe she doesn't like me"". ""Why has this project failed, when I did everything right and I put so much work in to it"" will turn into ""Why has this project failed"" ""Maybe I didn't do something right"" ""Maybe I put the wrong type of work in to it"" just to give an example."
depression,"Is it okay to contact my depressed ex? A little backstory: He has not gotten any treatment for his depression, but he's struggled with it for his whole life. Back in April, I decided I needed a time-out from the relationship and broke up with him. My grandmother had just passed away and I felt like I was falling into my own depression, because my ex didn't seem to care at all or wasn't able to emotionally support me during my difficult time, even though I felt like I was always there for him. It made me realize the relationship was very unfair and unhealthy and not at all emotionally fulfilling. Anyway, after I was able to grieve my loss and feel a little better, my ex and I started hanging out again and expressed to each other that we still love each other. I told him I wanted to give things another shot. I had some therapy for myself and have been learning as much as I can about depression and how to handle it in relationships. He said he doesn't want to lose me and wants to be in a relationship with me, but that he ""can't right now."" I told him I was willing to be patient and that I didn't want to lose him again. He had admitted to me that he tried to kill himself a couple months prior. He asked for no-contact. I was scared I would never see or hear from him again and asked if it would be okay if I checked in with him after a month. 

It has now been 5 weeks and I have not heard from him, nor have I reached out. I still miss him terribly and I still want to have him in my life. I know he said it would be okay to reach out after a month, but I don't know if I should. I don't want him to feel pressured or stressed, and I'm scared maybe when he said he still loves me and wants to be with me, it was all a lie and he's just too afraid to admit it. He doesn't use any social media and I don't know his friends, so it scares me thinking that he could have killed himself and I wouldn't even know. It breaks my heart that he pushed me away when I just wanted to be there for him and work through things together. I need some perspective on whether or not I should text him, or if I should continue being in no-contact and moving on.

Thank you."
depression,"What’s wrong with me? Out of nowhere, I started listening to Thriller by Michael Jackson and I started to cry. Not at the song, but I remember this one kid in middle school I knew and he used to do a tribute at every talent show-he really did see him as an inspiration at the time. I heard this song today and out of nowhere I started thinking about racial barriers and how crazy musicians alive today and possibly in the future have been influenced by him-like stories from folk lores that get told over and over again, changing the human consciousness along the way. I looked up this album and I see why it was such a crucial piece of music back in the 80’s-idk why I got so caught up in my emotions that I started to cry at the realization time flies so fast and what it must’ve been like being a teen back then. Idk why. I know it’s so weak and stupid but I get this way sometimes at other random non-sad things. What’s wrong with me?"
depression,"My Sun Sets The sun sets

I sit mourning myself

No time of death

Sometimes I spike my own drink

Before going to bed

Just so I can wake up a victim

Again

&amp;#x200B;

A new day

And I can barely remember what I did with the old one

I turn around

No footsteps in the sand

When did I last walk?

&amp;#x200B;

I watch the moon and the clouds

Earth spinning at 1,000 miles per hour

I use it as comfort

I’m moving

In some way

&amp;#x200B;

One full rotation of the earth

23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds

I’ve been trapped in those missing 4 minutes

Longer than I can count

&amp;#x200B;

""Flow like water""

But there’s no beauty in a puddle

Only in chiselled stone

The pressure of having no pressure

Leaves me shapeless

It’s about time someone cleaned me up

Put me away"
depression,I’m sad and confused. I had a panic attack all of a sudden last night. I was fine one minute and the next I burst into tears and I couldn’t breathe properly.

depression,"Job is increasing my depression but I have no other income Hi,

I just feel like an empty shell like im living but not alive. Ive dealt with depression for a long time and the start of 2020 I made a U turn and got into a career I always wanted to be in... being a chef job it ended pretty quickly due to covid and I now work from home as a telephone interviewer calling people to take surveys.

The job is simple and it gets me paid but its sapping the life out of me to the point where my depression makes me feel like im just existing. Its not so much the job itself, its just the people that I talk to are generally so rude and condescending when im always polite... this one girl did a great job in just spending the whole survey yesterday making fun of how im on minimum wage... obviously the line of work im in you have to have thick skin which i do but just constantly hearing it, for hours, nearly every day of the week for weeks will have some kind of effect on your mental health.

I have been trying to find a job in a kitchen since lockdown but the offers in a city as big as mine are so slim, about 1 new job offer every week if that, as opposed to maybe 20 a day before covid.

I just feel myself slipping into a really dark depression and ive been drinking after work to blow off some steam and now ive realised its the only thing i look forward to after work.

🙃"

depression,"i hate my friends and myself ever since middle school i've been losing friends one by one and i've also started having problems with social anxiety and depression. currently im in high school and i only have 2 friends left and i suck at talking to new people and making new friends.


so anyway, today was supposed to be a good day as we are going to have a one week break from school, but the problem was that we had to do a presentation. it was super hard for me because of my anxiety but somehow i still survived through it. while i was doing the presentation, i heard my friends laughing and saying something about me. after the presentation i went to ask what was so funny about me but (one of them had already left at this point) he just told me multiple times with irony in his voice ""don't worry about it. you can't always be perfect. you'll learn soon enough.""


after i went home i messaged him telling that he made me feel like shit because i already had a low self esteem before that and now they are making jokes about me and laughing at me and they are too coward to tell me what i did wrong. instead of answering my question or even just apologizing, he just sent me ""don't worry about it. you can't always be perfect. you'll learn soon enough."" and then continued ignoring me.


i just hate living my life like this. im so tired of being this lonely piece of crap that i am. the only friends that i have, i spend time with them at school, but when im home i'm constantly alone. the fact that my brother joined the army a couple months ago doesn't help much also. he was the only one i could talk to. nowadays when im home i always just sit at the pc watching videos or playing video games with random people because my friends don't want to play with me and i have nothing better to do with my life."

depression,"Inside=N/A I feel like I’m dead inside. Just a hollow shell, walking around... going to work.. playing video games.. and sleeping. Then i wake up only to repeat the process.

Im slowly growing numb. As if my demons are holding me down on the floor and sucking everything emotion out of me, leaving me with a depressed, meaninglessness void. Black, empty, hollow. Basically non existent.

Do people ***really*** care as much as you think they do?

Surely the guy that I walked past while going into the grocery store would.... right..? Right??! 
Maybe for a few minutes... if someone killed me he would feel empathy, and by next week I would be forgotten. 

Sad but true.

At least I have my family. I know they care about me and love me. 

But do they have ***any*** idea what I go through?

A little.

They know I used to cut, and have been suicidal. They know I have major depressive disorder.
They know i’m on meds.

But they DONT know how **lonely** I am.


How even surrounded by people, I am alone.

So               ...incredibly                                ..alone


It’s kindave like I don’t exist in a way. 





My demons have a deathgrip on me. It’s so tight that I can barely function. They have made my life exactly what they wanted it to be... despair. 

They threw me down into a pit and walked away.

They put me in a trunk and closed the lid. They kidnapped me and took me as their prisoner.


Some days it feels like they’re trying to wrestle me into my own casket and close the eternal lid. 


And I endure it every single day. 



Life sucks."
depression,"I'm living for one person only I have an LDR boyfriend and he's the only thing I really care about lately. Whenever I think of suicide, I can't help but remember how heartbroken he'll be. I worry he'll follow in my footsteps, since we're both in bad places right now.

Nothing else is really playing a big part in my survival, except perhaps my cat. I don't care about my family or my friends (or ""friend"" I should say, as I only really have one real one), I know they'll leave me when it gets too tough because my negativity is spreading, and that their support is shallow. But oddly enough, I don't get the feeling my boyfriend is the same. He's the only one who I feel genuinely cares about my well being. He's the only one I have energy to talk to and actually care about nowadays.

I know it sounds bad, but I seriously couldnt care less about how other people around me are doing. I only care for him. I'll try hold out a little longer, try to get better, until he leaves me. When he leaves me, I'll be able to do what I want to."
depression,"Worsening guilt and self loathing. I’ve dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, I was generally able to hide it for a few months until I wriggled my way out. Last year I finally gave in and saw my GP, who gave me celexa which helped for a few months, then stopped working, so she added Wellbutrin which worked a little but not much, and most recently abilify which I have yet to start, but I’m just feeling worse and worse. 

I told my doctor this time that I have been exercising outdoors daily, 5-10 miles a day. I’ve started working to get out of the house. I take vitamin a,b,c,d, probiotics, fish oil, iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc every day, I sleep at least 8 hours, I try to eat well. I cut out gluten. And I feel more exhausted and useless than ever. 

She said “you know, sometimes when you get started doing something that snowballs and then you’ll end up getting a lot done”

Uh, no. I “fake it” everyday. I get dressed. I do a full face of make up. Wake and dress my baby. I feed my kid and take him to school. I make him dinner. I walk just to be able to say I moved today. No I don’t see myself starting to clean the house and snowballing into cleaning the whole house. I clean when I need to, the goal is to not feel like shit constantly. 

Last night while crying to my husband he said “why don’t you just pick three things ever day and do those” and I looked him dead in the eyes and said “I do. I wake up, I get dressed, and I do my make up”. And he looked at me like I was insane. I am proud every single day that I get out of bed and that I can function at this baseline and suddenly I feel like I’m being judged in every direction which is making me feel even more guilty than I usually do. 

How do people just wake up and feel good enough to do things? What’s it like to not be constantly working against yourself and FORCING yourself to do basic things? Last night I completely broke down and asked my husband “aren’t people supposed to be happy sometimes?” Because I honestly haven’t felt happy since 2012."

Heck, I don't wanna be trapped in this life anymore."
depression,Not real. Mental illnesses are not real as there is no physical evidence of them existing. When you break your leg there is clear physical evidence but when you have a “mental illness” there is no proof that it is real. All of you claiming to have depression are sad looking for attention. Nobody wants to hear you complain about how “bad” your life is. If you contemplate cutting yourself why don’t you do it? Man up and do it or stop talking about it.

I try not to feel pity about what I'm feeling and I am aware that overthinking about it makes the actual physical pain worse.

Because they're normal reaction it's just ""Ohhh, but you're not that bad"" (even doctors).

I hate when my sisters who I haven’t seen in years call me and tell me they love me. I hate having to say I love them back. I’m gonna get kicked out of school soon for truancy. It’s my senior year, I don’t have a single extracurricular. And I don’t even have all my credits for junior year. I’m lazy. Cant get out of bed. Cant remember to listen to people when they say things until after they’ve said them. Sometimes I think I’m void of all the qualities that make a person a person. A inanimate wall that more delightful people pass by and don’t notice. I use to think I had important ideas. I still have ideas, (little songs and little plots) that are dear to me that I’m scared to let die with me. But I honestly don’t think that a fucking piece of shit who cant even get up to go to school in the morning like me, will ever gain the social capital or motivation to do anything other than sit, and willow, and rot, and be an ever present burdensome hum of failure to anyone in the vicinity of me. My ideas are gonna die with me anyways, so what am I waiting for? Idk why I’m writing this. I didn’t even ask a question.

We started texting to each other a lot and we then started dating. It was fantastic because for one of the first time in my life I felt connected to this point with someone else. I was finally able to be intimate with someone without being shy of my emotions. In my head it was almost a done deal that we were gonna be a couple and nothing bad.could happen cause I really had the feeling it was mutual. But then, a little bit after college started, I felt like she was more and more distant with me. My first thought was that it was a bad mood only that would came back to normal but days after days it was worse and worse. So I asked her what was happening and that's when she announce me that it was nothing against me but she didn't had the time to be in a relashionship and that she needed to take distance for a while. I was destroyed. I rarely felt so bad about myself and I was struggling dealing with this through the days. I been depressed and I was stuck with depressing thoughts all day long thinking about this. Recently, 3 weeks after she dumped me, she texted me again. It's feeling great but we ain't talking about our relashionship yet so I am stuck with the hapiness to talk with her again but also with the fact that maybe nothing will happen and that I will be back with all these negative thoughts and right now I really don't know what to do!

The cop simply over exaggerated my case that said I caused an “accident” along with “fleeing the area” and gave me that charge along with others. I was put on suicide watch for the first 3 days in jail since I said I had past suicide attempts which killed my self esteem even more since I was stuck in a cell for 23 hours with 30 mins of walking around. Idk why but I still get those flashbacks to the horrible conditions there. My depression has gotten worse cause of everything at home and jail.  But covid hit and I couldn’t go to court till august the judge dropped all my other charges except the DWI and I was basically forced to do a 28 day program which was basically jail. My life is over, I can’t stop shaking cause of my fines, probation, and everything that comes with it. I can’t handle the stress of waking up and having that fear of going to jail again. 

I used to love sleeping but that turned into constant fear. I am staying abstinent but they said I tested positive for weed in my UA cause of second hand smoking. I also gotten medication for my depression but that isn’t working for crap. I can’t sleep cause of the fear of doing this all over again. The stress and depression is making me not want to go to work or do anything.

depression,please help i used to be a straight a student and now my parents have found out i haven’t done any school work. now i have no freedom. i have to tell them all of my school work with them right after school. i also have to do all of my school work with them. i cant do anything during lunch except for homework or nothing. i cant play video games or talk to my online friends at all until all of my homework is done which takes all day. when i play video games or talk to my friends it’s the only time i feel truly happy. then ofc they are forcing me to hang out with my irl “friends.” i also now can’t get answers from my friends even though that’s what everybody does. if i lie to them about school they won’t let me play games for 24 hours and maybe take my phone too. they keep telling me they wouldn’t be doing this if they didn’t know i was capable. i would have done the work if i was capable. i want to die more than i have in many years rn
depression,I just want someone to talk too It kinda feels like no one wants to talk to me

depression,"Situational depression Struggling with situational depression. Unfortunately some good reasons. Don’t think I need meds. Started a therapist. But having a really hard Time getting out of bed in the morning. Anybody have suggestions? And on the subject of the therapist, I like her as a person, and I’ve tried many therapists before, and it all seems like they tell me I’m obviously immature educated proactive person and they’re not sure I need meds or not and what do I want out of therapy? I never know what to say and it seems like isn’t that their job?"
depression,"I’m a scumbag human being, I want to die because it’s what I deserve Im a scumbag, I will just keep hurting people unless I die

3 and a half weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me when I had an emotional breakdown and said and told her a lot of things I didn’t mean, she wanted to spend time with friends instead of with me and I just lost it, I don’t know why, but I did, when I dropped her home I tried to manipulate her in to feeling bad about leaving me alone when I was clearly distraught and then decided to say I didn’t want to be with her, which I instantly regretted, I then drove to her parents house hoping she’d be there and broke down in front of them telling them everything.


Looking back on our relationship I realise how manipulative and toxic I was in not just this one, but all of them. 

I’m so ashamed.

This isn’t the first time this has ever happened, I treated my last girlfriend like shit near the end of our relationship.

And the one before that I did the same, said stuff I didn’t mean at the time but later regretted then I tried my hardest to get her back but just pushed her away to blocking me everywhere and hating me.

I bring people in to my life, that I love, but I let stress in my life, my codependency issues, my neediness for validation and acceptance, take over and I flip, I because emotionally abusive and a vile human being.

I am scum, toxic, disgusting and truly deserve nothing in life. 

I wake up everyday completely ashamed at the person that I am and the things I do to those I love.

FUCK me.

All of my ex’s are happy I’m not in their life now, as I’ve been told, they are better off. Because I’m a toxic leech who does nothing but bring people down and bring destruction wherever I go.

I’m going to kill myself because it’s the only thing worth doing.

I can’t bare to hurt another person that I love, I can’t bare to go through another breakup with this immense amount of shame and hatred for myself.

I hate everything about me, everything."
depression,"If I drop out of school, do I ruin my life? I may have to, or suffer it out and hate day after day and person after person. Or I could just leave that place and heal and focus on improving my skillset. The last thing I want to do is go back there, I can't bear to. ""But I have to do it, otherwise, I will ruin my future"" is what I'm working with now. To what extent is this true?"
depression,"My sister had a severe mental breakdown so severe that my husband I decided that she would have to be hospitalized. I feel so horrible. Right now, I really don't know who or where or what to turn to, or why should I even be trying to evince sympathy or get advice from the internet. My mind is a mess right now honestly.

My sister had a complete mental breakdown the other day. She stripped herself completely naked and started yelling that my husband sexually assaulted her and threatened to call the police. My husband said that it has come to the point where he is no longer able to keep her as part of the family, because she had threatened to call the police. To him, if a family member ever tried to get the police involved, than he will treat him or her as a stranger. So he had no choice but to call the police first. When the police arrived, my sister was screaming, yelling, throwing things, while COMPLETELY NAKED.

I feel so depressed right now. I feel this is the most difficult time in my life that I have ever experienced. The pandemic. The economic recession. The riots. I'm completely dependent on my husband for financial support. At the same time, my sister is my only relative in the States. My parents are still living in Japan. So I can't leave my husband. But the split between him and her has been so great that he would never allow my sister to come back to our house. 

I don't know what to do now. I feel so alone in the world. I feel powerless. The world is so black to me. 

The police sent my sister to a mental hospital and I was supposed to go visit her tomorrow. But the thing is, she has nowhere to go. She lost her job due to Covid, and her longtime BF broke up with her. That was the reason she came to live with me. And now my husband said that he could no longer allow her to come back, so even if she came out of the hospital, she has nowhere to go! 

I'm so torn right now!"
depression,"I don’t know what to do anymore Hey guys, I don’t know how i’m going to stArt this. I’ve just turned 21 yrs old and I wish I could be happier like people my age. I’m at a point where I feel like nobody is appreciative of what I have to offer to them. I’m mostly talking about family members and friends. I’ve been surrounded by people at a young age and suddenly left with not many people to hang onto in my adulthood. 

I’ve been doing really bad since the age of 18 from abusing drugs, loosing friends that cared about me, family members that we don’t even interact as much. It’s really taking a toll on my life because I don’t have anyone to listen to me when I have problems but i’m always ready to hear another person’s problem. Right now, I feel like i’m at my lowest. I just realized my hairline is balding and i’ve been bleaching my hair for a year cause that’s what makes me confident. I am currently thinking about cutting my hair very short but I can’t imagine myself with short hair. Everytime I seem to ask for advices, people seem to brush off my problems and want me to take care of theirs. I have no problem helping people out but I feel like my friends are the people I can rely on to make me happy but I haven’t been feeling love from them. I understand growing up no one has much time for people including me. I stress so much in life, I have health issues that’s not making it any better. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t stand not being happy for weeks anymore. My hair is my biggest problem which is my key to confidence. I’m scared that i’ll loose that confidence but it’s for the best and to grow healthier hair cause it’s breaking off and thinning. I can’t complain to my friends, they don’t seem ready to hear my problems. I really don’t know how i’m feeling about life and my surroundings. I’m very antisocial, if I am socializing, i’m very awkward to talk to. I’m like in this bubble that I can’t seem to pop and it’s giving me anxiety. 

I’m so sorry, I had to rant. I don’t feel like pushing my problems onto people but hopefully you guys can cheer me up and help ourselves out ❤️"
depression,What's the point of living if you're always being pushed back and stunted? I never level up. I never get any better. I suck. What's the point of moving forward if you're always in last place?
depression,"I'm so afraid of people I'm a 30-year-old man who works at customer service over the phone. I don't love the job, but I try my best to put myself in people's shoes and assist them in the best way I can. Some people are lovely, but some of them are mean just for being mean, and I hate that. Why is it so hard for people to treat others nicely? Or at least politely? I hate it because it really gets to me. When someone is intimidating, I get this awful sensation in my stomach and chest, and it stays there for the rest of the day, and even upcoming days. It drains my energy and makes me stay in bed for days. I feel so weak for letting people I don't know do this to me, but I don't know how to deal with it sometimes. Today I couldn't manage to sit on my chair and work, because these horrible people have taken all my good energy away. I hate them!"
depression,"Aspergers, Death, Military, Love. 'Why I will Die Alone.' I'm a disabled Army Veteran. And... I just want to talk about my life... and my demons. This will be a long post, but I think posting this will help me move forward. I'm in a rut right now, and I've never talked about my life to anyone. So; to a bunch of strangers, it seems fitting. My father was a raging alcoholic, but he wasn't always that way. It started after I was born. I was an accident =/. Born August 10th of 1990. My mother left him in 1994, remarried to my stepdad in 1995. (good for her!) She had to work multiple jobs, and her mother basically raised me. I called her Grammie. My father used to take me to Chuck e Cheeses on the weekends he had me, and we'd play with all the animals afterwards (he did wild life rehabilitation and was a fairly well known electrician in the area) . Those times became less and less. I'd sit on the windowsill waiting for him to pick me up for hours and he'd never show. It brought my mother to tears. When I turned 10, I was brought before a judge and I said I wanted my step-dad to be my real dad. My last name was changed, and I was adopted. Grammie's husband was ""Grandad"". He wasn't into the picture much until he retired in 1996. He had worked for IBM as his last job. He took part in the creation of the first super computer, and lead the team that created the first ATM. (amongst many other accolades) When he was working, he was gone for months, none of his projects could be talked about and, one of them he was on a submarine for several months. My Grammie was a champ, and raised me while dealing with that. He retired and became a huge impact in my life. He had Aspergers, everyone just saw him as an introverted genius at the time. (I also am fairly certain I have Aspergers, but I'm no introverted genius) He taught me to fish, how to use a computer, (we played killer quake 95' on dial up together) how to play pool, tennis..... list goes on. My stepdad was for a while a traveling salesman, so we moved A LOT. my brother was born in Texas, my sister in Virginia. 6 years and 8 years younger.  The reason I bring up traveling is because half way through high school I had to move. We were in New Jersey and it was the longest we had ever lived in one place, 6 years.  All of middle school, half of high school. We moved to PA and in the first few months I got into my first ever fight I had not instigated or wanted to be in it. I defended a ""nerd"" to a ""popular"" kid and got punched in the face, didn't retaliate, or really do anything, mostly stood there in shock.  My mom asked what happened to my face, called the school did the mom thing, they said ""well he should have hit him back."" In NJ there was a strict rule, if you hit back or hit, you are expelled. ( I hit back the next time, and got detention on a Saturday. They never said that would happen... They avoided me after though. ) We lived right next to a Ski resort, and I got my first job ever as a snowboard instructor. ( I was in the ski/snowboard club in NJ, we'd go to Shawnee mountain every weekend in the winter).  Met my first 'real' girlfriend at a competition... time skip yahdayahda. My grandfather in his retirement decided to get back into flying planes, tow planes and gliders (was always a hobby of his). He took me up several times growing up. I wanted my pilot's license. He used to be an instructor and I waited so long to grow the balls to do it, He had to go renew his license. On the way back from renewing it he was hit by a Brinx armored car head on and died on impact. I've always felt responsible. No matter what anyone says that will never change. 4 weeks before graduation, and 6 months after. My grandmother was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. The day I graduated I moved from PA to VA to live with and take care of my grandma. I attended a nearby College at the time for criminal justice because I thought being a detective would be bad ass. Her condition got worse and worse, I had to help her to the bathroom... shower... etc. I couldn't handle it. I started distancing myself from her. On Christmas Eve 2009 She died in the hospital with my mother there... I was not. The last thing she said was "" I just want one more Christmas with the family, this is a happy time, I can't die yet.""  My mom lost her shit, put the house on the market (I was supposed to be able to finish school living in the house) Kicked me out and sold it, I moved in with a random craigslist roommate in Richmond.  Had to drop out of school, got into weed and alcohol for the first time ever.  Worked 3 jobs, and was quite miserable. One thing after another didn't work out for the next 4 years and I found myself dating a drug addict, and sleeping on a friends couch. My relationship with my mother was destroyed for a long time. My step dad, no my dad... Was trying very hard to help me, but I didn't want to be helped. It wasn't until I stole 12 weed plants out of someone's yard and was selling them out of the motel I lived in that (and confessing it) that he drove 11 hours to rescue me. Brought me back 'home'. They lived in upstate NY now at this point. I had a local job for a year and was doing okay, but slowly started getting back to my habits of pot and excessive alcohol. I was told; ""join the Army or join the homeless shelter, you've got 1 week to decide."" So............. I joined the Army. It kicked my ass, gave me structure, gave me purpose, told me what to do when to do it, and how to start thinking straight. I was a 35N. Signals Intelligence Analyst. Loved my job, loved the people, made a new family. About 4 years into it I lost several members of that family, and I lost most of the function of my right shoulder. After 3 surgeries and 8 months PT I was medically discharged. I went back to school, and finished a computer science degree to supplement my experience in the Army. My second year, I read a news article that my old unit was hit hard by a truck getting onto post and exploding. I lost a couple really close friends. I was crazy down and almost dropped out... but I met a wonderful, beautiful, amazing, woman, we hit it off and dated immediately. She's from Myanmar, graduated Summa cum laude. We had an amazing 2.5 years together and even talked of marriage. She got deported 6 months after graduation because no one could afford to offer her a working visa. Now she is back in a third world country with a computer science degree, and all of the money her family saved wasted. I now work the job she dreamed of, and I drink a little bit more every day."
depression,I'm scared of what I'm becoming I just found out that me not wanting to commit bc I'm scared of hurting my bf is toxic. I'm becoming toxic I know that I'm doing it to me but I'm doing it to him too? I feel so selfish for dragging him down with me and he's already really stressed about stuff and I'm gonna add on to it. I'm no where even close to being able to get therapy I'm so scared of myself and what I'm gonna do to him in the long run. Why am I like this I hate what I'm becoming.
depression,"its crazy how easily a good day can turn bad. today was the first time iI felt genuinely happy in a while. i has a great time during lunch with my friends and met some awesome new people in my sports performance class. 

i get home and all of a sudden my friend tells he about how his new girlfriend is super unstable, has attempted suicide so many times, and how he had to talk to her on the phone to keep her from cutting. i basically spent the next two hours giving advice to him. 

now i just feel so sad and empty. like hearing about his girlfriends actions opened a bunch of old wounds. so many thoughts ive tried so hard to put behind me. 

i just dont know what to feel anymore..."
depression,"I can never stay proud of anything that I do, even if I should be. I need advice on how to deal with this. To give a bit of context on my background, I'm currently a university student about to go into grad school for Computer Science. My family is heavily religious and I can't exactly talk to my family about this (it's caused major issues in the past when I tried)

Whenever I accomplish something and feel proud of it, I almost always fall into a deep depression right after. It's usually triggered by some sort of comparison to someone else who has done something equal or even better (especially to someone that I know personally and/or is around my age) or a fear that I won't be able to accomplish similar things again in the future and that I've already peaked.

I've been told by many (including some therapists) to just stop comparing myself to others and focus on myself, but I still have no idea how to do that. There's always going to be something that triggers this comparison, even if I don't expect it, and I can't stop myself from spiraling once it happens.

I've tried to distract myself by doing different things, especially in areas that I want to improve in, but I can never fully commit to anything and end up failing. I also have this fear that if I do anything else that doesn't relate to my current career choices, I won't ever be successful in the future. This fear increases my depression which ironically ends up making it even more difficult to do anything that would help me with my career path.

At this point, I feel like my life has already peaked and that everything is going downhill from now. I once thought that maybe I could accomplish something great in the future and become someone people could look up to, but after so many episodes of depression and being told many times to accept mediocrity as well as that I'm idiot for thinking that I could be anything more (and perhaps I am an idiot), I can't bring myself anymore to believe that everything will work out.

And yet I'm still naively hopeful that maybe I can find an answer to all of this somewhere. If anyone has any advice please let me know (and I hope that what I've written somewhat makes sense)."
depression,"annoying shit the other day someone told me something in the lines of just be happy it’s not that hard, look on the bright side, etc. just wanted to punch the in the face bc i feel that people don’t understand how affected people are by mental illnesses. but at the same time i was so jealous because god i was it really wasn’t that hard to be happy. just wanted to share ok bye."
depression,"Can school make you depressed I recently began my senior year of highschool, and as you can probably imagine it's very difficult during a global pandemic. I feel like my troubles started during the mid to late terms of my sophomore year, my grades began dropping, I gained weight, developed an ed and body image issues, self harmed, thought about and attempted to take my life, distanced myself further from my friends than before, went through a break up, I've had problems socializing in public( like I've always been the ""shy"" kid, but it's gotten to the point where I don't even want to go to the small grocery store alone anymore), I feel like I can't trust people anymore, and feel like my life is a dead end... the list goes on. My relationship with my family has been slowly deteriorating and I just kind of wish I didn't exist, I don't want to kill myself, but I just wish I was never born. I haven't asked my doctor about getting diagnosed but I feel like I have might have depression and some sort of social anxiety, but I'm scared to ask because I don't want my family to treat me differently if I do. But with school, I usually start off strong but quickly end up with piles of missing assignments, and I feel pressured to keep my grades up high, and am in some ap classes but they're stressing me out already. Can school make you depressed, I'm not getting bullied or anything, but the work is already too much, but I don't want to drop out or anything. College is also another factor right now, because I want to go to a good, but affordable college and my school nor my family have done much to prepare us for college, and I don't know how I'm going to get in. But bach to highschool, I feel like I'm not going to learn anything this year, because our school decided to go half virtual and half in person, so they split us into two groups (a Mon/Wed and a Tues/Thurs group), on the day that one group meets, the other group does online work, and the next day when the other group meets, the first group does the online work, then we do google meets on Fridays. The schedule is really confusing and it doesn't feel like were actually learning anything, we basically have to teach ourselves, and it isn't working. I don't really know what to do at this point.

Tldr? Can school make you depressed? Does anyone have tips for getting through school and staying organized and focused? 


P.S. I'm really sorry if this is confusing and all over the place, it's 4am and I just typed everything out."
depression,"Utterly alone and scared I'm going through a divorce and haven't gone outside in weeks.  Even the thought of walking down the street for some take-away makes me feel absolutely awful; I haven't been able to do it, despite every morning telling myself ""today I will.""  I can't even seem to order delivery.

Advice is always to talk to friends and family, but I have no one in this country.  Moved across the globe to be with my spouse and now my life is just over after years of trying and loving."
depression,"sun and moon making me anxious Does anyone else get anxious looking at the sun and/or moon? Its been super smoky where I live lately so the sun appears like an orange orb and you can look directly at it. Whenever I go outside I get so anxious because I perceive it getting bigger and bigger, I'm afraid its going to blow up or turn into a black hole. Same thing with the moon at night, I always feel its going to crash down to earth and kill us all. It seems that at all times I'm hyperaware for an apocalyptic event. Does anyone else feel this way?"
depression,"Running out of ideas 

What to do, what to do...

I have been floating in a sea of anxiety and unhappiness for a long time. Fortunately, there have been moments when I have been able to get climb
onto my life raft and enjoy the nice weather around me. However, it has mostly been windy, with the regular storms creating waves that throw me in the murky water. I am a good swimmer and have only occasionally ended up under the surface. But even a good swimmer gets tired of the constant struggle to stay on board or climbing back after treading in the water. I have my ankle strap on, but I am low on strength.

I am so occupied with the struggle to stay on my raft that I am not able to paddle towards the shore. I can see it in the distance and on good days I make progress towards it, but the bad weather pulls me back. I know that my raft has the capability to keep me safe in rough seas, even to move forward, but the instructions are written in a language I do not longer seem to speak. Actually, there are a lot of good
things with my raft, but I am unable to appreciate it.

There are vessels around me and I have reached out to a couple of them. What concerns me is their inability to help my situation. They see my distress but focus on my swimming and ways to climb back to the raft. I cannot seem to get help from them on translating the instructions or helping me to create my own. This despite telling them that I have been doing this for quite a long time, they still want to take it slow – finess my technique to swim and climb.

I am running out of ideas."
depression,"I had enough Description about myself:
 
Im 16 years old, middle class family and the youngest family member.
 
Reason:

For as long as i remember i always have been quiet kid, average student, average son. Never really been an atletehetic person( though i don't know why i look fit) im just an average joe. Though this past few years  my mental state has been ""confusing"". My family has always been the ""prideful"" type, and well i always thought of myself as an outcast. I never score straight A on my exam or bring a unlike my other family members. My mom keeps comparing me to other kid, keep telling me that they are more discipline than me, smarter me, better than me. For as much as i love my mom, i just can't stand her as an individual. My dad has always been the quiet type, but his a trophycaring person, someone that i admire but someone i can't communicate too easily. My siblings, well there is my big brother and let's just say his a ""control freak"". If something isn't following on what he intend it to be, he will be violent and aggresive. i don't know how many time he has slap, kick me, ridicule me. The worst part is that fucking ""this for your own good"" card AND GODDAMN I HAD ENOUGH OF HIS BULLSHIT HYPOCRITE WAYS( sry had to left off some steam). 

Some days i wish school didn't exist and i would be laying down at a grass while i listen to some music. Sometime i wish i had a best friend who i can call a true brother . If there was another dimension where that certain reality exist i would'nt hesitate to choose it but at the same time i wish i didn't exist in the first place.

If your reading this, please tell me on what i should do to make this live, this reality worth living. At very least show a me that there still a sign of hope."
depression,"I feel so gut wrenchingly sad but I can't cry. I need to rant. If you want to read then welcome, I'm a very closed off guy so it won't mean a lot to you but this is big for me. I'm a 20 year old male and i can't bring myself to cry. I feel like I can't even commit myself to that properly. I feel constantly upset, I'm almost always anxious, overthinking the most basic social situations and if I'm not anxious I just feel miserable.

I don't even know how to write this, I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I'm not living for anything, that ultimately no matter what I do im not happy, I'm not satisfied. It's almost like Im in constant mourning. I can never just enjoy the moment or see myself as somebody who fits in or somebody worthy of anything. My parents try so hard to keep me together while giving me space because in the past I've lashed out for them being too in my business, but the truth is they're the only reason I feel like I'm still alive right now. Honestly I know how much of a gift my life is,  I'm very lucky to be sentient on this earth let alone a middle class white guy with loving parents. I just can't fucking be happy, the only times I'm able to really laugh at something is when I'm high. What makes it worse is that my life philosophy is that a happy life is the ultimate goal. We don't know why we're on this planet and likely don't even have a reason, so we might as well enjoy whatever life is. That can be whatever form of subjective happiness you like, I'm just talking about general enjoyment and fulfilment, so when I say I can't find happiness, I can't find it anywhere. I mean I can't be happy in the most simple, selfish ways like just enjoying a book to myself, or making a pizza with my mom for fun. I feel some happiness from making other people happy but even that joy feels like it's diminishing, I feel like I don't make other people that happy anymore with my jokes and kindness. I really try to make people laugh, not just for the sake of it but because I really want to spread happiness and seeing somebody else light up when they're talking to me cause they're having a good time can make my week. Feeling like you changed somebodies day in a memorable way, feeling wanted, it's really all I want. 

I'm just struggling so much, I hate saying it but I would give anything to go back in time to highschool. When I didn't have thick, pink scars on my arms. When I had a highschool girlfriend and a good group of friends around me, worrying about upcoming tests and what we were doing this weekend. Before I got dumped and diagnosed with thyroid cancer the same month I graduated highschool. Before everything I knew got flipped on its head and I was going to a new college, getting surgeries performed to remove tumors, trying to stay close with my dwindling friend group only to lose half of it after my buddy's gf confessed she had feelings for me a few months ago and of course that's my fault so rather than break up they both stopped talking to me.

I got a little carried away there, basically I'm just really upset because I try and try and I'm just never quite good enough, for somebody else or even for myself. I try to make other people happy and even when I do that I feel like I'm a waste of space because I'm not actually doing anything. I have a good life but it feels like I'm not doing anything right, I feel like I've already failed while I'm also not doing enough with the time I have. Like what's the point of trying when I'm already shit but then I get sad when I haven't been trying to get anything done. I feel so helpless, but in the way that I have plenty of tools just no drive to use them. I know where I need to go, what I need to start doing on even a day to day basis to start feeling more accomplishment in my life, but I don't have the will to just go for it.

One idea that's keeping me sane is the philosophy of optimistic nihilism, rather than asking myself ""why bother"", I'm trying to ask myself ""why not"". Instead of ""why bother taking a shower?"", It's ""Why not see what the world has to offer today?"". Why not go nerd mode in college and try my hardest? Why not try to live a happy, healthy life? Why not keep moving forward? This has been very helpful taking some big first steps for me but there's only so far the happy go lucky attitude can take me. So here I am, ranting online because once again I can't sleep. Once again I feel so lost and overlooked, I feel like nobody is really willing to listen to how much I'm struggling yet I can't seem to blame anybody but myself. I'm here tonight because once again, I tried to cry but the tears won't come out. Again, I failed myself and am left to silently weep while cradling my own self loathing. But tomorrow will be another day, and tomorrow I will try again."
depression,"ALCOHOL and depression I had a depression for 5 months but now its better. I stopped drinking bc alcohol make depression worse and thats why i stopped. 
Since few weeks im feeling better and start having fun again. In 2 weeks i go visit my family in eastern Europe and what should i say them why i dont drink anymore. I need an good excuse bc they will look at me strange when i just say them i stopped drinking without a reason. Do any of you have an excuse ? I dont want to drink anymore never in my life again bc i know if i have a drink the depression will start again."
depression,"Depression in a Relationship This is my first time posting but I’ve been struggling with depression for a about 3 years now. I just constantly find myself in my own head, not being able to be present in my own life. I panic a lot as well, about really small things like if the house isn’t clean or if I haven’t done enough before my girlfriend gets home. I feel guilty all the time and just feel worthless.

How do you cope in relationship? How do you not feel guilty when you can’t even hold down a job to help out? When your girlfriend is killing herself everyday to make enough money to support the both of you. I just want to be happy for her for a change instead of just feeling sorry for myself but every time I try and do something nice for her or for us I panic and freak out

I just want to fix myself for her but I don’t know how?
Any ideas?"
depression,I hate my life so much Why the fuck am I still here? I was sad a couple days ago but today all I feel is anger. I hate how we need to work our whole life just to get a couple years of freedom then die. What’s the point? Maybe it’s just self hatred but I really don’t see how my life is going anywhere. I don’t even have the ability to build meaningful connections with a person. How can I really be happy?
depression,"Why is it that the people closest to you hurt you the most. I hate myself because of them It's so tough when you have nobody to talk to. I don't feel like talking to anybody Anymore. I have only two close friends and they keep bullying me. We've been Friends for more than 10 years now and they're like a part of me so I can't dump them. It's so hard. At the same time they both bully me so much , they Never consider my Feelings. It makes me question myself. Have I been Wrong all along? It must me some fault with me that I get treated this way. I feel like I can't share my problems with anyone cause I'd be bothering them. I have no one. Even my family abuses me so much mentally. I've been telling them that I have trouble breathing and they just straight up ignore all I say , it's like my existence dosen't matter. 
It hurts , it hurts so much that I keep crying every second. I can't Process Anything. I hate myself for being this way , I want to kill myself , they make me feel so unworthy. They keep calling me fake. My anxiety has peaked and my head keeps hurting. I have no one I can run to. I hate myself due to what they all keep saying. If there was a chance to go back in time , I'll take it and kill myself before I was even born. I can't take this Anymore."
depression,"Facing my problems doesn’t help. So many people will say to look inside and face your problems to move on, but every time I face them, I just go back to being in pain. I’ve been in my own head for years trying to figure myself out, to no avail. People say it’ll get better, but this has been pretty much my whole life so far. I put energy into people and things and never get any effort in return. I just want to be acknowledged, yet when I am, I feel like I don’t even deserve it. Smiling has become muscle memory and talking to people I respect just brings me down because I can’t stop comparing myself. The only person who cares about me only sees my once every two weeks or so. I’m so tired of trying. The last time I had a relationship with a girl was 5 years ago and the last time I made a new friend was around the same time. It’s always me initiating conversations and always me making plans. My parents disowned me and my own sister looks down and laughs at my failures. I have no motivation for anything, yet I somehow committed to keeping my job because that one person is a coworker who’s been a better mom than my mom ever was. There’s beautiful moments to come but only momentarily. I can’t even afford food rn and I’m also struggling with an addiction to nicotine. I’m such a mess and no one has ever cared. No one has ever checked in on me. Never get a happy birthday text. Never get a “how are you doing”. I’ve cared for everyone I come into contact with yet not a single one could do so for me with no previous interaction. Nobody gives a shit, much less me but I can’t give up entirely because I don’t want to fuck up that one persons life. Fuck my parents and fuck everyone else I know"
depression,"People don't care I don't think I'm important for someone, no one really care about me or need me, I'm useless and no one would miss me, maybe for just few days and then stop. I'm useless and just not important for anyone."
depression,"Everything feels different Since about February everything in my life had felt different and I don't know how to fix it. I feel like a different person, a person I dislike and a person I feel people don't deserve to have to be around. 

My mindset is different, I can't seem to concentrate or strive for anything at all cause I just feel numb. My relationship feels different, I feel like I am just an issue because I'm down so often. I just feel like a fake person, like I would usually be happy and now I just don't even have the energy to pretend sometimes. 

I feel like I want to make drastic changes, just to get this feeling to go away but I know I would regret all of them. I was so happy at the start of the year and now I just don't feel like me anymore. I have so many regrets already that play on my mind so would a few more change that much?"
depression,"I feel so empty. What is this empty feeling inside me? I can't explain it but it really makes me sad. Everyone keeps telling me ""it's going to be okay"" or they tell me ""I'm here for you"", but how can I trust them if the same people who have told me the same have cut me out of their life so easily. I can't stand the endless entanglement I am in. I feel trapped, drained and sad. I feel like no one supports me in school. I feel like no one supports me in life. I'm struggling to find a positive outlook. I'm struggling to find happiness. I'm tired of happiness lasting a sort moment. I'm tired of feeling that my feelings are not valid to others. I am tired of having to explain to people why I feel the way I feel. And I feel that it just gets deeper and deeper. I just want to be happy."
depression,I feel like writing a note in advance I am not diagnosed with anything but I have anxiety issues thats getting worse over time to the point where I just dont see the point in living anymore. My thoughts kept fluctuating between wanting to try and live better and just giving up. I dont wanna be a pussy anymore so maybe I should get this over with.
depression,"I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality and ability to parse and filter through thoughts who's only basis is irrational anxiety/insecurity. I need to write this. I have nowhere else to unload my thoughts. 

I always imagined that I would have had a better grip on my life at 25 when I was younger. In fact, I had high expectations for where I would end up. Every adult that I interacted with before college certainly thought this.

It's not hard to see why. I had all the markers for success. I was sociable (voted into student government in HS), had lots of people who considered me as a good friend, I did well in my HS coursework(3.95 unweighted GPA, 2310 SAT/35 ACT, numerous AP exams with a 4+ score, A's at the local community college since I was a HS freshmen) and I had hobbies that I was passionate about(Jazz and Varsity tennis) To top it off, I was a decent looking guy who was 6'+ on a bad day. One would think that I had won the lottery by looking at stats alone. I had such high hopes for myself.

It all went downhill in college. I had a terrible work ethic. The only reason I had succeeded in HS was because I was in a HS somewhere out in the sticks frankly with teachers that they themselves had not fully digested the course material. Once I arrived and had to compete with people who had to have developed a work ethic in order to excel, I was outmatched.

I tried so many things. I cut off social contacts and tried to increase my raw time spent studying. I took a brisk walk ever 90 minutes. I tried new note-taking patterns. I tried reading out loud while I studied in order to retain the material. It was not enough, I had the attention span of a goldfish and could not succeed. I barely put in the minimum amount of effort to pass my classes, using every ounce of my energy to find easy filler courses so that I would not lose my financial aid. 

I think despite the repeated failures, I still had a sense of self when I graduated university. I regularly ran at least 8 miles/day. I kept a journal that I promised to create for my future children to read lest they ever be interested in my thoughts. I still networked and managed to find a temporary job that paid around 22/hr. 

The next few years were humiliating. I watched as other peers gained jobs at prestigious firms or got into professional graduate school at top-of-the line institutions while I performed QA tasks that someone who had a year's experience at GeekSquad could potentially do. I resented my co-workers and began resenting myself. I stopped exercising and my journaling became sporadic - weeks of silence would pass by before I would write a long-winding rant about something trivial. 

As I continued, I began to notice that I began falling deeper into a cycle of destruction. My thoughts became that of a pain, wounded animal. I had no grand plans, no way forward like the previous times. I had no hope for the future. My only directive was to move away from the ever-growing sources of pain that appeared in my life. I wanted to be released from the never ending drudgery of life. I began to take up drugs(weed - taken by majority of Americans in lifetime) and even tried LSD(taken by only 6% of population in lifetime). The relief they provided was ephemeral and destructive. I could not even perform the basic tasks required of me and had to quit. 

And so in 2018, I spent 7 months unemployed. It was honestly the most soul-crushing moments of my life. There were entire days that just melted away where I did not even have the energy to move 2 feet to grab the remote. A moment of reckoning came when I had collapsed from exhaustion one day. I had collapsed as I had forgotten to eat for over 20 days drinking only water because this was all I could muster to consume. 

I knew something had to change. I knew I didn't want to die. 

So I started studying for a new career. I learned the very basics of software development. Thoughts now came in much slower pace than before. I found that I had trouble digesting concepts and focusing even more than before. There were so many times I played back a 5 min video over and over again because my attention had drifted. There were so many times where I just gave up less than an hour in and slept as my brain had shut down from all the stress and anxiety that had built up over the years. Despite all this, I was able to land a job after those long 7 months as a software engineer making around 62,000. I was hired at one of the Indian MNC that had signed a pledge to onboard as many Americans as possible and was hired despite the fact that I was far from a competent developer. 

Fast forward to today. I am struggling due to COVID-19. Before WFH, I was able to reach out to my coworkers and ask for help. With WFH, it's becoming impossible to ask for advice and guidance on small topics. I'm becoming even more overwhelmed and I am getting blocked by the smallest things. I can tell that I have used up all the goodwill on my team due to my sheer incompetence and I can tell that I'm on my last days in this company. 

A rational part of me knows there are more ways forward even if I'm fired from my current job but it just feels like all the doors around me are closing. Lately, I have been looking at live videos of people committing suicide online and sometimes, I feel that the primary thing stopping me from doing the same is how gruesome and painful these attempts look. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to gain by writing this and I'm unsure of why I initially believed that the act of writing this would be cathartic. Perhaps I thought that an act similar to writing journals would bring some sort of normalcy and control to my psyche? I'm not sure. To be honest, my mind has been so hazy recently, I am not sure about much. If one thing is for sure, I just want other people who are walking the same path that I am to know that there are others walking with you, even if you feel like you are so alone."
depression,It never gets better. I don't know why people tell me that because it's a lie. It always gonna be like this and it will never stop until I'm dead.

Cause that's what im going through rn"
depression,"Depressed for 2 years, now feeling empty and unable to do ANYTHING productive In my first year of college I became severely depressed for certain reasons (nothing traumatic; I ended up losing all self confidence by spending over \~200 hours on this project and it ended up failing, so all of that time I put in felt wasted. I was already very lazy/unproductive before, but this just destroyed my self-confidence and I stopped doing anything besides the minimum schoolwork to keep a good GPA). I basically spent the next 2 years of college doing absolutely nothing with my life. I have this mentality where I can do the minimum amount of work needed to ""survive"" which in my mind is keeping a 3.7+ GPA so that I can get a good software engineering job and be comfortable. Anything lower than this would feel like death to me, so my mind is somehow able to function enough to do well in school no matter how depressed I am. But when it comes to my dreams, passions, and hobbies, my brain does not give a single f\*ck. I really do care - I always used to work on fun side projects and hobbies during high school, but after depression settled in high school I completely shut down. I literally finished all my college work in \~2 hours in the morning and spent the ENTIRE REST OF THE DAY on YouTube or manga. I never even read manga before, but after I realized that YouTube got boring after a few hours, I literally adapted to increased my laziness and picked up manga as another time waster. As soon as it's time to sleep or I have some work to do, I would break out of this temporary brain distraction and realize that I had a real life to live and remember all the things I actually wanted to do. I just kept getting better at escaping by sinking myself further into the digital entertainment world of YouTube, Netflix, and Manga/Webtoons.

Now it's been around 2 years, and I feel horrible that I did absolutely nothing to them. Sometimes I feel better by saying that regrets aren't logical and that things can be better if I change right now - but I literally can't for some reason. I actually took a few therapy sessions \~6 months ago and I felt GREAT for a week or two and thought I was cured. It very, very slowly crept back over 2 months and it was so gradual that by the time I realized I was depressed, I was TOO DEPRESSED to bother getting therapist appointments again. It doesn't really make any sense. I actually decided to finally book an appointment a few weeks ago. It's literally just a few clicks away because I just have to send an email and setup a time. I really WANT to book the appointment, but something is just stopping me. I mentally just reel away at the thought of booking the appointment and instinctively switch to some YouTube or manga site to numb myself.

But here's the actual part I wanted to talk about. The depression feels different this time around. Before, I would feel sad. I would constantly remind myself that I need to change and feel bad about it. Now, I just feel numb. My suspicion is that it's because back then I was at college and was independent, so I knew I HAD to change. Now that I'm at home because classes switched to online from COVID, I feel so comfortable with my family to support me and a steady education that I feel ""complacent"" with this shitty version of myself which makes me mad. I think subconsciously, I'm getting completely complacent with this lazy version of myself because I know I can survive like this. Even if I continue to barely work each day, I know I can work just enough to maintain my GPA and get a high paying engineering job, and since I don't ""need"" any of my hobbies to live a part of me just wants to throw all of it away and live this lazy worthless life.

Before, I would wake up and know that at some point I would be able to recover even if I didn't know how it would be possible. Now, I wake up and go to sleep feeling like this will never ever change and that I'm permanently stuck like this. The part that scares me is that a part of me feels like I don't WANT to change, while the other is desperately screaming to fix everything. COVID makes this feel even worse. Before, I would at least have friends to meet with everyday that would remind me to at least do SOME sort of work and I would occasionally be able to start some hobby work, even if it was just for an hour. Now, that's basically impossible. Friends still text/call but it's so easy for me to just ignore them that I actually end up doing that sometimes. Any time I do talk to them, the positive effects are only like 1/10 and I don't really care about anything since it's all digital.

I literally feel like a dead soulless body with a rotting mind right now. I had an internship over the summer which was fun, but even then as soon as work was over at 5pm I would do absolutely nothing. Now that the internship is over too and my school doesn't start until the end of this month, I've had a solid 3 weeks of doing absolutely nothing. Wake up, eat, watch/read entertainment, play video games, sleep. I only feel truly happy/energetic when I play Smash Bros for an hour or two with friends, and as soon as it ends I just feel stupid and brain dead again as I go switch back to passive entertainment. I feel like my eyesight has gotten worse in the past 2 weeks too and anytime I stop looking at my monitor I feel suffocated by the blurriness. I had glasses already but it was very minor (I only use it to watch TV) and I feel like it only got worse by very little, but the emotional toll and addiction to my laptop to numb myself is making this suffocation feel worse.

**tldr;** Depression has slowly turned me into someone who cannot do any work besides the bare minimum to survive (schoolwork, job) and I can no longer do the hobbies I used to love so much. I had lots of goals outside of just getting a job, but I'm not motivated to do anything even though I actively think and wish I could do them. Can't even book my therapist appointment even though it would take me 2 minutes to setup (I'm literally spending 10 minutes writing this on reddit instead of just booking the appointment). Depression used to feel sad yet hopeful, now I feel devoid of emotion and I feel like this is the end and I can't change.

Sorry for the really long post. Just wrote everything I was feeling and wanted to be as descriptive as possible."
depression,"Never been to a doctor, don’t want too when I feel like people have it way worse, and also don’t wanna talk about my problems undiagnosed....because maybe I’m not depressed I don’t know how long this will be, I’m not much of a writer. I spend most of my nights staying up till it’s daylight, thinking about school....remembering the good times I used to have In school. I’m now 21 years old and haven’t been to public school since 2015. I can’t help but feel like my best days are behind me. Around my freshman year I started to get really nervous around people. As a kid I was a very outgoing person and funny and just the kind of kid my dad says would light up a room and want to be friends with everyone in it. But as I became more self conscious about my weight and appearance I started to hate talking to people. I was the “class clown” but towards the end I felt as if I was going there playing a part, not really being me. So I left for online school. Fast toward now and I feel almost numb, I feel so alone...I feel the want for human affection and contact but ik I won’t get that. I feel everything really strong, like if I’m reading about something sad or around someone sad I feel it times 100 of that makes sense. I feel lost, like I already fucked up my chance at life by not being good in school. And like it’s all down hill from here. I stay by myself most days and just stay in a room. I feel so nervous and thinking about how much of a loser I am and how ugly people must view me. And I don’t really have the type of friends you can talk about this stuff with....idk I feel I explained this very poorly but I just wish I had someone to talk too."
depression,I keep creating this fake memories to make me happy.... To the point that i don't even know what memories are real and what memories are fakes🥺
depression,"I am numb In the last 4 years I have slowly lost all emotion a and constantly few empty. nothing excites me anymore, nothing gets me out of bed. time keeps ticking away and i have nothing to show for it."
depression,"The internet enables depression I just realized that the internet is enabling my depression and maybe even making it a lot worse. Right now I just sink all of my time into YouTube/Netflix/Manga/Webtoon in order to make myself numb and NOT feel depressed. It literally feels so good to teleport my mind into these fantasy worlds and forget I even exist. It literally feels like warping out of existence temporarily into someone else's world.

But if I didn't have access to these time wasters, what would I do? Well, I would basically be forced into thinking about my depression and I would have to spend my time some other way. Then I realized the only other thing I would do without the internet was just go back to my hobbies and passions that I dropped because of depression. Entertainment sites were literally like drugs that I got addicted to, but if they were never there, I would just end up resorting to my hobbies because it's the only other way I could spend the time and enjoy myself.

I would end up just sitting there at first, feeling really bored. At some point I would just get so bored and sick of feeling depressed that I would try to use my hobbies as ""drugs"" instead of internet entertainment because it would be the only other option I have.

The obvious idea that comes to mind is to just disable the entertainment by blocking them or using timers. But honestly the fact that they exist already makes it infinitely hard to even consider disabling them. It's like asking a person addicted to drugs to just stop. I guess at this point, I don't really know what to do to get off using the internet as a crutch instead of actively trying to solve my problems and depression. The true solution is probably therapy, but I can't move myself to book the appointment because I'm that lazy (or subconsciously avoiding it for some reason, idk)"
depression,"Im scared of the future Hello everyone

I am just finishing school and im scared of the future. I decided this might be the best place for advice. I have just finished high school and its a good thing. I am so happy that i finally finished school. However Ive come to realise im scared of the future. The main issue is getting a girlfriend doing university and still maintaining friendship with my high school group"
depression,"I Realized Why It’s Worse - I’m naive TW: possible harassment?

It’s a vicious cycle. I have chronic depression, complicated now by a TBI/migraine disorder, and by work. I feel down, I overwork myself. COVID hits, I work 4 shifts a week, 48 hours, 30+ miles in that time on my feet, hardly any time to sit. Then I’m out for months with an injury. 

In that time, a male friend starts getting close. I’ve been basically conditioned to be comfortable with being uncomfortable now, that’s my job now as a health care worker. I didn’t realize the hole I let myself into until now. 

I haven’t slept properly in over two weeks. The male friend knew my sexuality and pushed verbal boundaries. 

He told me I’d look pretty naked. Made more jabs about me being sexually attractive after I told him the topic made me uncomfortable. Told me about things he and his ex did that his ex isn’t even comfortable enough to tell me herself, all without asking. Just spilling. 

I can’t get the off handed comments out of my head. “Why do you wear makeup?” And later explaining how he doesn’t like women wearing makeup. Talking about how it’s perfectly fine and normal for guys to jack off to girls they know but they should never be stupid enough to tell them. Not to mention talking about anime body pillows all of the time... which I had to urban dictionary.

Getting offended when I have other plans. Continuously asking if I’d like a friendship hug when I’ve made it clear that I do not hug, and has even asked while acknowledging it. Has started to up the physical touch from no contact to poking the shoulder to most recently a playful jab. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, but I hate myself. I don’t want to keep repeating this damn cycle and I want to go back to feeling ok and not feeling like I need to drink to keep it away because it feels like I’m looking over a cliff. 

I’m in my 20s, I should know better by now. 
Maybe everything was meant to keep going wrong."
depression,"I don't know what to do I work night shift and don't go to sleep until close to 4-5 am. Was sitting here listening to a podcast trying to sleep and just came to the realization and thought ""im tired of being alive""."

My diagnosis is Depressive Psychosis. I have been mis diagnosed before.  I am now on 4 different meds. I do believe my diagnosis is right because it explains a lot. I hope now that i have a proper diagnosis and proper meds i will get a little better. I don't expect to be ""normal"" just a little bit better would be good. 

Thank you so much for reading."
depression,What the hell do I do now? !! I 17 and I am in a really bad place right now. I hate myself so bad for having depression and anhedonia I dont even have the courage to go to a class I might change classes because I feel so aimless all the time and its like the hardest classes. I am falling behind every day because I cant decide which classes I will take. im so lost right now and every day seems like hell and I worry my parents because I dont eat much due to depression and anxiety.. I used to like chemistry and biology but now I barely have the courage to study it and its too much effort to achieve something average and I began to dislike chemistry. I feel like I want to vomit all the time because I dont know what I want to do with my life and I hate myself. I have a lesson in like 2 hours and I have exercises to do but im so burned out and lost and they're hard and I cant get myself to study. I dont know what to do anymore.. everyday just gets worse and worse and I suffer. I want to get a university degree but most schools I looked at were average at best and I just feel so lost no matter what classes I choose I will be behind in at least one class like uuuugggh..
depression,"I haven’t read a book in almost a year. Reading used to be my favorite thing to do. At one point, I was reading a new book every two days.

Now? The last book I read was in October of 2019. 

I hate depression. I can’t focus on what I used to love doing."
depression,"My future The only thing that has really been keeping me from hurting myself is the fear that someone will point it out. I am graduating high school soon and really dong know where to start. I hear about people signing up for colleges and I have no idea what’s going on, or what my future will hold. I always wonder if it will get better or what my future will be like. I don’t want to be the lonely, sad, man on the street that everyone is afraid to talk to, but I feel like that’s what’s going to happen. I still feel emotion, and care for animals/all living things because it’s life is no different from ours, but every day i show and feel my emotions less and less. I feel unwanted by people, and it seems like my friends/girlfriend are losing interest and will use any excuse to not see me.

I apologize for writing so much, I can’t really put it into spoken words and wanted a place to vent"
depression,"I’m tired of my mom I’m just so tired of her, everytime I think she’s finally being nice to me she suddenly changes, she doesn’t physically hurts me but mentally it hurts like shit, I just turned 15 a couple days ago and I’m already ready to end my life, she blames me for stuff that aren’t even my problem, everytime she’s mad I try to ignore talking to her because I know somehow she’s gonna make it my fault. She just got mad at me for attending my online classes and not sitting downstairs with my family..of course I can sit downstairs but I wouldn’t even be able to focus cause of my little brother and her screaming all the time, I just wished I could somehow leave this house but I can’t and it’s suffocating, I’m seriously so ready to just end my life but I don’t want my friends to break."
depression,"I really need an outlet or a therapist to talk to. I have issues that need to be solved before I can do anything. I don't really read any aggressiveness I get from people, but I think I'm generally off-putting. And the only point on living is the social aspect of things, I'm starved of that completely. To the point where I'm considering becoming a heroin addict in order to escape this lonely feeling. I'm willing to become another statistic to avoid the pains of being faced with my unfortunate reality everyday. I want to fix this, I want to become one of the most social people to exist. Even if I come off as soulless on surface to the few people. 

I just never had an opportunity to have real friends, a real group of friends. I only have friends online, I met with them in person once before but this pandemic is making meeting up with them impossible. 

But I don't think I could generally hold up a job very well. I was fired for messing up on the cash register too many times, but this was during training. I don't know if they wanted an excuse to sack me or what because I was the only one wearing a mask but either way this shit is concerning to me, if I'm not able to hold my own on a basic retail job, how am I going to fair with the unfortunate reality of the extremely parasitic and monstrous landscape of late stage american capitalism? 

It's so pathetic, I notice everytime I talk with somebody I always say too much not necessarily too much in terms of detail about myself but I ask too many questions. I constantly overthink things."
depression,"The shitty people are the most successful and I'm over it. Is it just me, or does anyone else ever feel like you would probably have a better life if you didn't have a shred of a fucking conscience? The selfish, self-serving people willing to step on any and everyone to further themselves are the ones who always [seem] to come out on top. Financially, it's becoming a real struggle, trying to do things the ""right way"" and never getting anywhere but farther behind. The cherry on top is the way it always seems to end up being shoved down my throat when I'm at my lowest how easy some people have it. 

A perfect example: 
An ex-friend recently began selling some pretty hard drugs in the last several years, hence why we are no longer friends. She has everyone she claimed to give a shit hooked on it, laughs about taking their entire paychecks, and fucks them over with in the deal any chance she has. She treats her boyfriend like complete shit, steals from him, has never had a job or so much as bothered to look for one but manages to collect state benefits because she lies about who lives in her household. And the chick has it absolutely made. MADE. But me, full time job with other odd jobs on the side most days, not doing shady shit, and not fucking people over, I can't win. I'M the one who can't afford to have my hair cut or my lawn taken care of. I typically get one meal a day. 

Yeah, fuck you too society. 

I'm realizing a lot lately that having moral values is a curse, not a blessing. 

Who's that in last place you ask? It's the nice guy, thats who."
depression,"I don’t want to do this anymore I know how pathetic and cliche it sounds, but I can’t do this anymore. Today It’s worse than ever been. I’m afraid I will kill myself today, even If I don’t want to. Everything hurts. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist. I have no one to run to. No one understands.
How to escape this? Please, I’m tired."
depression,Unwanted Was in a relationship for almost two years. It was my first long term relationship and I felt so happy. We had plans on moving in together and I loved her more than anything. She lost feelings for me during the relationship and ended it. Seems to be a really recurrent theme. I decided on no contact but I still think about her everyday. It’s been over a year without her now. My life has changed so much since then. Idk where to go or what to do with the rest of my life. I’m just trying to focus on myself and improve what I can. The things I don’t have control over make me wanna die. I just want one person to love me who doesn’t have to.

I’ve never been able to tell how I was feeling. Or at least put a name to it so it’s been difficult to explain myself. The two things I can definitely say though is that I’m riddled with anxiety and I want to die. 

I’ve tried so many medications and so many doctors that at this point I don’t remember who I was when all of this started.  I’ve been hospitalized 2 times with one of them being 10 days and a 2 month long outpatient program after a suicide attempt. 

I wake up in the morning and I feel awful. I walk past trucks and think of how I could fall into the front of one. I look at bleach and think of how I could drink the bottle. I pick at my skin until I’m dripping blood so that I feel something. I just want it to end.

I want to be put in a hospital and have my medications tapered off. I take 8 pills in the morning, 1 at noon, and 7 at night. I went to see a neuropsychologist about my memory concerns but he blew me off because I’m just “a walking pharmacy”. 

I’m sick and tired of all these doctors appointments, all these therapy appointments, all of these blood draws, and lab tests. I’m tired of waiting to be evaluated for this and for that. I’m tired of being told I would benefit from a service dog I can’t afford. And most of all I’m tired of living. I know how easy it would be for me to end it but my mom told me how she would never forgive herself if I killed myself and how I would ruin her life by it.

I wish she understood what my life was like. How bleak everything is. I wish I could feel like a normal person. I look at the coronavirus statistics and don’t bat an eye. I watched my grandfather die of cancer and couldn’t even cry at his funeral. 

This is just a rant and maybe it doesn’t make sense but I wanted to tell someone. I hope no one has to go through the same things I have and still do go through."
depression,"I want to go to therapy Recently I’ve been wanting to go to therapy weather it’s family or just for me. But my mom doesn’t think we need it. Someone who has written a suicide letter apparently doesn’t need therapy. She started an argument over me not sitting at the table for online class and we don’t need therapy. 

It feels like when ever I try to get better I get knocked back down and have to start over."
depression,"I just need a break. Hello, I am known as a jokester and to be honest, no one takes me seriously on anything. I'm here writing this message just to let what's inside of me out because I can not handle this.

I always wanted to have an everyday life, a partner shares with me, to have the right talent, to have a better body shape, have a promising career, and more. That's what I thought when I was young. Everything will be smooth when I grow up. And now I find myself in the dark space where I have no one besides me, and I can not deal with this. I do not want to die; I just need a break.

Any suggestions on where to start?"
depression,"I hate the expression “you can’t love anything else if you dont love yourself first” No. I love nature, I love movies, I love books, I love my family, friends and boyfriend and don’t want them to feel the way I do. 

I have so much love in me that isn’t not for me.  

I hate myself but I love everything else. I love memes. 

One can continue to love things/places/persons while hating themselves. Hating self does not mean we only hate. Hating self could mean I love life and if I was asked, I would choose to live it in another vessel."
depression,"any advice for coping with depression on my own until i can afford a therapist? i’ve (23F) been struggling with depression for a large majority of my life. i begged for therapy all throughout high school, but my mom told me to just “deal with it”. that was until she walked in on me getting dressed for prom my senior year and saw the self harm scars on my body. she sent me to a christian based child therapist and it didn’t work out well... at all. i’ve just been sort of dealing with it, but it’s starting to take a toll on me. 

my depression started manifesting itself in the form of anger a few years ago. it’s easier to get out of bed and get things done this way, but i’m sick of being so mad and irritable all the time. it’s almost worse than being devastatingly sad 24/7. i’ve tried journaling, but i have a hard time putting my feelings into words. i don’t really have any way to express myself. i’m wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how to cope until i can afford another therapist?"
depression,"What are your distractions? I slept 3 hours last night and now exhaustion is compounding with stress, and I know that if the sun was shining, at least, it would bring me something. It's crazy just how much, for me, is tied to light. 

I'm tired all the time. The kind of tiredness that's settled into my bones and weighs me down, and never quite goes away.  But I always, always look for the good - because there's always good, somewhere.

But this morning I'm not feeling it yet.  Maybe I just haven't had enough coffee. 

In any case - what is your lifeline? What do you do when everything feels heavy?  The coping mechanisms I thought I'd perfected over the last 20 years are falling short and I just need to find that pause from where I can inhale fully again."
depression,"At the lowest point of my life Im really.....i dont know what to do and i feel really bad .
Im in real need of money to buy some food and pay some debts.
I have nobody to help me and my life is miserable .I tried all options but really im left with nothing."
depression,I want to end it I hate my body. I hate not having a driver's license. I hate being who I am. I wish I were different. Fuck my shitty genetics..
depression,"I thought I was getting better I'm writing this on my phone, apparently that's an issue sometimes I guess.
I come to you guys now because I thought I was getting better. I was in just a dark stasis for years and pulled myself up and filled my life with distractions. I started a bunch of new hobbies that I wasn't fully interested in but just interested enough to get me through the day. Having to find things that only require 1 person, that would entertain me all while also not breaking the bank seemed to be challenging enough. Then I met her.
Everything seemed to be going great. She convinced me to let my guard down and get close to her. I shared things with her that I hadn't told anyone else. I was starting to think that all the challenges I went through before were just lessons preparing me for this great life I was starting to see possible with this kind, beautiful, funny, loving, active, and driven woman. But it was all for not.
She came to visit me as she routinely does after she leaves work. The evening was going well as usual and then the dreaded statement was made: I need to talk to you about something. She explained that she wasn't ready for a committed relationship as she is a couple years younger than me and wants to experience and accomplish more and wont be able to achieve this if she feels tied down. Other reasons were given but I believe it was because she knew how devestated I was.
I could hear the sounds of glass shattering behind me as everything fell apart. I'm slipping back to the dark place and can't keep myself from crying. I'm desperately grasping for those mundane hobbies and empty minded practices to keep myself from wandering but it feels like once I let myself feel happiness I am unable to get back to my old coping styles.
I can't eat. I can't sleep. Though I'm happy and supportive of her and her wishes and can't make her do what she doesn't want to do I'm laying here in a pile of melted false hope.
I put the fake smile on. I shower. I go to work. All day I can feel the pain growing in the pit of my stomach as I can't wait to come back home to fall apart all over again.
Thank you kind stranger for reading this and allowing me to put my thoughts out in the world. It may be pointless but atleast it makes it feel real."
depression,"A proper diagnoses and making to-do lists has changed my life I'm going to start this post by saying that I have more or less struggled with procrastination my whole life. I don't mean the cutesy 'oh whoops I handed in an assignment with 5 minutes to go before the deadline', I mean the 'well fuck its two weeks past the due date, I suppose I should try to emotionally guilt my professor into giving me an extension so I don't fail this course'. 

This, coupled with intense fatigue that is with me pretty much at every waking hour, means I've missed a lot of opportunities along the way, and its led me to still being in a dead-end retail position while most of my cohort are succeeding in their careers. Depression, anxiety, and eating disorders got the best of me, and the last four years I've pretty much become a shell of who I used to be. I constantly felt guilty, worthless that I wasn't living up to my family's expectations, and hopeless about my own future.

A lot has changed recently, first because I was finally in a place where I could afford specialised doctors (my country subsidises health and mental health plans and luckily is not on heavily lockdown atm). I got diagnosed with a form of OCD that apparently manifests as intense perfectionism, and a severe reoccuring eye problem led to a diagnoses of an autoimmune disease, which is known for causing fatigue and interrupted sleep. 

It sounds terrible, but I cried a lot when I found out. All my life I have been told and fully accepted that I am lazy, and here was this psychologist telling me that anyone would have struggled in my situation, that it wasn't my fault. 

It's been a few months or so since then, and I'm in such a healthier head space. I started making to-do lists at the suggestion of a friend (I like writing them so much). I started with just a few things a day (e.g. get up, make your bed, tidy your room, go for a walk), and I would put all my effort on just making sure one task was done before moving on to the next one. I've been building up to bigger things that I've put off for so long (doing job applications, getting back into hobbies, doing more intensive exercise). It's actually working, and I'm strangely optimistic.

It's still a long way up from here and I know I'm probably going to have relapses, but if I can just do one thing a day on my list, then I will have done something."
depression,"My Father took his own life before I was 3 years old. I visit his mausoleum. I don't leave flowers. I wonder if he said goodbye to me. My Ma doesn't know. Too hard for her to talk about it and I just stopped asking. Basically, I'm 44 years old and I have only recently dealt with it all. I have lived with depression. I have embraced it to some degree, because why fight it sometimes? The first day with a therapist was inconsolable misery. After which he said ""You are an emotional dump truck.""

Correct. And if I never sought their assistance I might not be posting this today...

I have children. 

I live for them.

I hope they leave flowers for me."
depression,"I can’t get up, I just don’t know what it is For the last four years (I’m 17) I’ve stayed at home for about 2-3 days a week. I used to start the week off strong and go to school for the first two days, but now I cant even do that anymore. At first I thought I was just tired and faked being sick, the next year I actually felt sick and for the last two years I just don’t know anymore. My parents let me stay home even if they know I’m not sick (which doesn’t help either), because I get good grades, but my school doesn’t like me being absent this much. When I logically think about it I want to go to school, I want to be with my friends, not lie in my bed ‘til 2PM being unhappy. Every night I go to bed thinking about how I will change it tomorrow, but when I wake up I just can’t bring myself to get up or do anything other than lie to myself about how it’s fine. I don’t think I have depression, but I just don’t know what it is or what I can do. I’ve been telling myself for four years that I don’t have a serious problem and that I should just get up tomorrow, but I simply don’t do it. I’m very bad at talking about my issues, I don’t even think my parents know the real problem. Also, beside just not having enough motivation to get out of bed, I also have developed a serious sleeping problem over the last 5 years, I regularly get up at 2-3PM when I stay in bed, causing me to only fall asleep at around 3AM, which in turn causes me to have even more trouble getting up. When I try going to sleep I always have this voice in my head saying “you have to fall asleep now, or else you won’t be able to get back up again tomorrow”. Another thing that keeps me in my bed is the fact that I’ll have to face my teachers and some students that get “annoyed” at the fact that I’m never there.

Im sorry if this was a garbled incoherent mess, I just had to say this somewhere and maybe someone has something helpful."
depression,"Given up emotionally but can't give up physically The title might not explain it all to well.

I've struggled with mental health problems for years now and I think I'm at a point where emotionally I have no desire, no will, no confidence or direction to get back in the fight and figure out my next step. When I've spoken to doctors they've told me to check websites and mentioned therapy a few times but I've never felt either to be successful. Websites just say things that I'm supposed to associate with but it's really just words to me. Therapy hasn't worked so far but I feel it's largely due to who it's been with and what we've been talking about. It's been a lot of what can I do differently to not be nervous in this situation or not feel like a failure etc. I understand the logic and I have tried to do it but I just honestly don't care enough anymore. I don't mean in a lazy way, I really wiah to be better, I just don't WANT to be better anymore, it feels so unattainable.

I don't want to die, I always get asked as part of the safeguarding process I assume and honestly I don't, I want to find purpose I just don't even know where to start and as above I just don't know if I can find that want to even have a go.

Some days I can distract myself, but lately it's getting harder."
depression,"I'm fed off studying I'm a 3rd year Licence (France) student and I had burnout 2 years ago during an Erasmus trip. 

I love languages. I'm very passionate about Anglo-Saxon History, culture and langage. My mother insisted that I become a teacher, but, the thing is I'm still very tired from what happened during my Erasmus trip and I'm not sure I want to be one (it would mean I'd have to get a PhD to teach Anglo-Saxon civilisations and litterature...)

Then I have also met my boyfriend, which who I have a long distance relationship. We want to settle down together, first in France, then eventually in Donostia (Spain).

I'm 22, but now all I want is getting married and have children and a nice, good-paying job.

And my idea now is that I would like studies that allow me to become a sole trader in translation, interpreting and localisation.

The thing is I have PTSD, and I'm very exhausted psychologicaly. I feel I don't have much energy to study anymore. I'd be looking for a short formation in languages, if there were any in France. If I had enough guts, I would try and start my entreprise. But I'm tired really, and lost... I feel I can do it anymore."
depression,"I dropped out of college It was only like two days ago I joined this app and ranted on here. Well my depression, family and life in general got the best of me. I dropped out for good this time, as my parents wanted me to even though they financially never supported me or emotionally. My money has been gone but that's ok ig. Had a heavy breakdown yesterday bc of it too. I wished I was 17 again applying for colleges and working hard to go somewhere farther. But then again bc of covid, we would still be on our laptops at home studying getting charged full tuition... anyway back to job hunting as I'm currently gonna start a min wage job at a general store. But it sucks how I went from being a full time student with a part time job hanging with friends during lunch to having to be an adult trying to work full time with no friends. I wished I was a college student at a uni."
depression,"Focusing on what’s in front of me My depression has seemed fairly heavy recently for a lot of the same reasons everyone has posted about. The world right now can seem really horrible and ugly and most days it feels easier to not engage than be forced to process it. For some reason today I got to the point where I had to try something different to get my day moving. 
I thought about when I used to play football and a phrase kept coming back to me. “Win the battle in front of you”. I don’t know why it kept coming back to me that I just needed to focus on winning the small battle in front of me and then hopefully the overall tide as they say can turn. At least that’s how it was always explained to me. 
I’m not sure why but that seems to be helping me make progress today. When I focused on the small thing I can do for myself right now in front of me, I seemed to get a momentum going. 
It’s a small thing but I feel like if I post about small steps maybe I’ll stick with them."
depression,"Help/Advice for the girl I'm dating TW// Suicide Hello, I've been on this subreddit a couple times, because I find it vas for me to read some stories, but I finally joi joined today to seek fine help for this girl I'll call Sara.

So Sara and I been dating for some time, and we both have depression and are already going to clinics to get help and stuff, but I myself don't know what to do to help her because she's absolutely convinced herself that she can't get help, and she's told me that she is tired of trying anything because she does not longer have an opportunity for what she did.

She had already told me that her mom was dead, but yesterday we talk about it and Sara told me why she cries herself to sleep every day. Her mother killed herself like a year and a half ago, and she blames herself because of that, because her mother did it while she went out for cigarettes, and when she came back here mother told her that she was sorry for doing that stupid thing and that nobody loved her.

Sara told me time and time again that she couldn't even say she loved her or day goodbye and that if at that time she wouldn't been so mad at her for everything and that if she would've said to her she loved her she might still be here. And that she died believing nobody loves her because of her.

She has told me that she would've killeded herself but that she died not have the courage to do it, and that if it weren't for her dad (who is an asshole) she would've starved herself to dead.

We have talk about our depression a couple times before and no matter what I say she still believes she has no reason to exist.

I know I can't convince her that it isn't her fault, but I wanna help her to find a reason to live and not just wait for her death, she always tells me that there's no help for her, that it is too late for her, and she tells me that she doesn't want to hurt me and that I still can get better, and that she wants to help me because she is already done trying for herself.

What can I do to help her not to feel helpless? is there anyone who's ended in a similar situation with one of your parents? Any advice?"
depression,"Having a tough time, just venting A therapist told me that I ""likely"" have clinical depression but I'd need to see a psychiatrist for an actual diagnosis and treatment. I never followed up on that.

I've been married for a long time. I don't think I'm in love with my wife anymore. I love her but more like a friend or even a room mate. We don't really get along like we used to and we've been in a dead bedroom situation for years (her choice, not mine)

I don't ever remember feeling head over heels in love with her. I think i settled for her and got married because that's what was expected of me. And that she wanted it. 

She'll talk about things we've done in the past, places we've gone, things like that. And she'll say how we had the best time. Me, I feel like it was ""meh"". Yes, it was fun. But it's not something that stands out in my memories.

But thinking about it I can't really come up with ANYTHING that stands out in my memories. Not the trips we've taken. Not concerts we've seen. Not my kids being born. Not a Christmas morning opening gifts with the family. Not being out with friends. Not really... anything at all. I just feel like everything has been bland.

My therapist said that I'm bored because I've ""hit all my goals"". So I need something to look forward to. Get a hobby, save to buy something I want or to go somewhere. But I can't think of a single thing to look forward to.

I should point out that I am NOT suicidal, nor have I ever been. 

I've tried to make my life exciting. Probably not the best thing to do but I've had a few affairs. One was with a woman that I absolutely adored, but she was well out of my league and I was always worried that she'd leave me. And in the end she did, but not maliciously - we just got to a point where we couldn't go any further. But that absolutely crushed me.

I feel like I'm just going through the motions every day. I'm not excited about my job like I used to be. I'm not motivated to excel like I once was. Sometimes its even a struggle to get up out of my chair and go across the room. Not physically, I just feel like getting to the point of expelling the energy required to get up and go is too much work. Does that make sense? 

I'm forgetful. For example I'll be browsing Reddit and I'll see something and will say to myself ""I need to look up X"", then a few minutes later I'll pop open a web browser to go look that thing up but will have absolutely no idea what it was. Or I'll be driving and will think that I need to pick something up from the store. If I even remember to stop at that store by the time I get there I have no idea what I needed and will just wander aimlessly hoping that my memory will be jogged. 

I don't feel that I'm connected to my family at all. I don't talk to my brothers or parents - I don't really want to and its been so long since I have we don't have anything in common any more. That is not a worry for me at all, I've never been close with them.

I can't remember the last time I've had a good night's sleep. I've tried sleep drugs but they don't help, I either sleep for a few hours and wake up at 3 or 4 AM or just can't fall asleep until the wee hours of the morning. 

I've always had OCD issues but they've been getting worse. Things that are in the wrong place around the house worry me, I can't relax until they're back where they belong and that kind of stuff will keep me up at night. 

Basically I don't know what's wrong with me or how to go about getting myself back on track. 

I'm sure the best answer is ""go talk to a therapist or psychiatrist"" but was looking for... I dunno. Support, maybe validation, maybe something else. I don't really know. Maybe I just wanted to write it out to get it out of my system. What I really want is a hug from somebody who cares."
depression,I feel like I’m losing myself Everyday I wake up and feel terrible and my mind starts running. Most days I can’t even get up and shower or change my clothes anymore bc I’m too depressed to do so. A few weeks ago I wanted to end it all but then I got admitted into the hospital. The hospital treated me like crap and basically kicked me when I was already down. I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I know my friends are tired of hearing me talk about how depressed I am. I don’t have the strength to turn things around for myself. I don’t know what to do anymore and I honestly feel like ending things again. But I know I can’t even do that right either.
depression,"suffering I had a crush for a very long time now and I'm 100% sure she had a crush on me too and after I didn't see the signs it drove me to depression because it became a love not a crush anymore. I was waiting for the school year to start, to see a person I love. She rejected me coldly because she didn't want a bf atm and I was relieved like I was reborn, but not for long. Recently I became depressed again, everyday I think of her maybe she will ask me out, then I think that I have to move on because it's over. When I drive home I don't want to leave the town because it reminds me of her, when I get home I become anxious and just listen to music. I don't want to do anything anymore in life, I wanted to go to military and I still want kinda, but I get numb and just want to be with her. I thought about suicide somewhere in my late 20s maybe, to go out quietly. But then I think that maybe she will text me so I get away from suicide. I of course really want to be with her and if there's at least 1 little opportunity I would 100% take it, but I should move on, but I can't and this excruciating pain inside of my chest almost never ends. I can't get over it, I really don't know what to write anymore, I am too scared to talk with my family about my depression even though I know they are good people and will help whenever I need help. I don't play games anymore, I try to look at other girls too, I think that if I find someone that I will love just like her I'll be in peace again, but I can't because a lot of things remind me of her and I can't just simply quit these things. When I see a meme that is funny on reddit it makes the pain to go away for a little, but it all comes back. I hope that one day this pain stops and I find someone that I'll love just like her. A lot of you might think that oh it's just a crush you'll get over it, no, it's not just a crush anymore, I love her I want to spend my rest of the life with her and only her, I want to have a family with her, I want to cuddle with her and do other all stuff that bf and gf do. I'm just broken and I want to be fixed."
depression,"It sucks how mental health is never a valid excuse in college *CW* 

anywhere, really, work included. I can't keep track of my lies. My ""headaches"" and ""migraines"" and ""feeling sick"" are all lies. I can't keep track of them. I wish instead of saying ""I stayed home because of my headache"" I could say the truth ""I have no motivation or energy. I want to kill myself. I hate myself so much and I want to die. I can't even drink water or eat healthy. I can't even do my work. I want to kill myself""."
depression,"So bored I hate my life, and I hate the people around me. Most of them, anyway. I really wish I could up and leave, but I can't. It probably would not make me happy anyway. I see videos of people ending it all every now and then and sometimes I imagine myself doing it. I wonder if I ever will. Probably not. I enjoy life, but I hate my own."
depression,"I don’t know how to help myself anymore I hate that this is what I think and feel, but I’m at loss and don’t know how to help myself anymore.

I’m only 22 and yet I’m already tired of being here. I’m exhausted and I’m in pain. People tell me that I’m “strong” and “resilient”, but I don’t think they realize that I’m barely staying afloat. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I’m on four different medications just to make me feel “okay”. I journal. I feel like I’m doing everything right, so why do I still feel so miserable? What else can I possibly do? I don’t want to go to my family because they wouldn’t understand. If I told my friends they would think that I’m crazy. And if I tell my therapist or psychiatrist, they’ll send me straight to a psychiatric hospital. I don’t want any of that. I’d rather suffer on my own.

I hate that even when I’m happy, I’m not truly happy. I wish so badly that I was a normal, well-adjusted human being. I want to go home even though I have a home. I know that doesn’t make any sense to most people, but it does to me. It’s like I don’t belong anywhere. I really don’t think I was ever meant to live a long life. 

I started cleaning out my room yesterday and I’m looking for a new home for my pet. I plan on dropping out of my college classes within the next few days, too. I still want to live, but I want to get in my bed and never get out. I know I don’t have the option to do that, though, so I’m ready to just give up on everything. I don’t see a point in trying anymore.

Last night I went to the park and stayed there until almost midnight. I just sat in my car and cried because I want to know someone cares. I was waiting for just something. I think deep down I wanted one text, one call, one anything that showed me people love me and care about me. But no one did, and I guess I should have expected that"
depression,"Listening? Do you think anyone is listening when I cry myself to sleep ? 
Do you thing anyone listened while my mom abused me?
I wonder if someone heard my fathers last breaths . 
I wonder if the “God” I prayed to ever laughed at my misery . 
Is there really peace in silence when my mind is screaming? 
It’s all nonsense. 
I cease to exist."
depression,"I'm being crushed alive. Fuck! I feel like I have no chill anymore. I feel actually broken. I'm so full of anger and vitriol and sadness that I can't fucking deal.

I work in mental health. I daily get to see crying children and hear stories of horrific abuse done to children I'm very fond of. 

My marriage is in the swamp and I feel like I get no respect at home including from my 3 and six year old. Whenever I try to talk about my problems with my wife she interrupts me, tells me its not her problem or my kids jump in the middle and interrupt. 

I'm physically injured and according to my doctor I ""have the bones of a 65 year old"" even though I'm 34. So thats great. My back is irreparably fucked and 8 can't even play with my kids.

I'm mentally ill and have ocd, anxiety and clinical depression. I was suicidal not very long ago. That alone is like being tortured daily.

My country is full of hatred, racism, corruption, and now has bloodshed in OUR cities. Add to the mix corona virus, devastating fires, and the new anti intellectual movement that fills our streets with anti masters, anti vaxxers, etc. While corporate America bends us over the barrel daily and get breaks from corrupt politicians while everyone else can barely make enough to survive. I owe tens of thousands in collections due to hospital bills that the veterans affairs office promised to pay because of war time disabilities. But they never did and now there's no record of it anywhere. 

On top of all that i made the damn fool choice to enroll in school to get my masters amidst all this. 

My stress is intolerable. The availability of suicide used to be a comfort now it seems worse than death because it would ruin my children's lives. In mental health I get to see the direct affect parental suicide has on the survivors. The stress is so bad that I'm sick ALL THE TIME and I have NO VACATION TIME because I've spent it all on sick time. 

I'm so utterly alone and tortured and I can't even kill myself."
depression,"I don't see many other options I'm failing all my grades, I can't get out of bed half the time and my brain is fucking mush. I can't focus or remember anything anymore.

But in every place I go for responsibility,I just act weird and draw people away from me or do things that will piss them off and even make fun of me.all the fault was not mine all this time.but ı always had faults and so did them.This has been happening since the middle of the 5th grade when effects of a traumatic event start showing and that event happened 2-3 years before but whatever.

I'm at 12th grade now and since 7-8 years,I haven't been normal.Like I said I either made people hate me and get away from me or make fun of me or starts fights with me.This mostly happens on places I go for a responsibility.It might be a thing of pressure of trying to make something of your life and trying to prove your inner self that you are equal with everyone and while trying to prove yourself that,you just piss some people off and until your job is done with that place,they either mock or fight you with words,or you live with fear of those since you know you made yourself enemies.

Since I never felt right and lacking for years,I developed o habit of telling things that bothered me or deep inside made me feel lacking and not enough to my mom to get the guilt,sorrow and hopelessness out of me.I've done that for years

And this thing i told you about doesnt happen if im somewhere without a reason.let me tell you how it works.

In the past my mom would just drag me out of the home forcefully because i would leave the house just for school.I hated going out because i didnt have any friends and also i lived in a small place and was afraid of seeing the enemies i made.It was like that for 5 years or so

In the last 2ish years.I made a bit of a progress and got talkative if im not under the pressure of responsibility or trying to prove myself im a normal person.and that happens only in places i go without pressure and without a reason.

Don't get me wrong.I still don't have any friends and don't like going out casually.but when i do,atleast im able communicate properly and dont wait until the person that is talking to me shuts up

Now lets get to the recent event.I signed to the private teaching institution and the thing i said happened.I made myself an enemy again and to get the feeling I'm not enough and I'm lacking,I wanted to talk to my mom to be able to keep going.

But she was keep saying me she had enough of my rubbish in the last years.because I took andidepressant therapy for 3 years and another therapy called EMDR for 1 1.5 years and though both of them made me way better than my 5th grade situation.I was still having the feel the need to talk

See I'm quite lonely.I don't have any real life friends.There are some only people I know because I see them in school but I Don't know them one bit so they are only known persons and not friends.I don't have a dad.they divorced when i was at 3rd grade and he attacked us after a couple of months after divorce and tried to kill my mom,my grandma,my little brother and me.weve been going here and there.most of the time not staying at a place more than 1.5years.so it gave me a hard time at school.my uncle helped us a lot in these times.

So here i am.wanted to talk to my mom about the thing happened at there.and she got real furious.since my uncle was home and we wanted him to think everythings ok cause he was to go in a week.I shut up and waited.everyday İ went to the private teaching institution,came back,opened pc,played games till night time,and rince and repeat for a week.when my mom turned me like this.I started to feel lonely and powerless yet i waited so maybe i can talk once he is gone again.but didnt work out the way i thought so.the day he was going back to the place he lives.I just knew if i stay at this situation.my life will be fucked.while i was on thr road to there,I called my mom and told her i wanna go to therapist again,i havent been going for months but not because i rejected so not the most important thing atm,but she rejected due to financial reasons and it was ok for me,i told her this is the university year so i want to be able to take my problems out of my head to feel better,put the weight out.but she only got angrier because she was getting quite tired because of the years and had no enegry to listen to me.out of feeling even sadder.I slowly came back home.my uncle was still there.it was an hour before he was going.he took me to my room and he talked.told me y""oull either have and education,or straight go work somewhere,or go to your fucking dad.your grandma is getting older and she is getting more sensitive to ilnesses and your mom is getting more tired because of the toughness of the life,so these are your options,write me tomorrow.""

After this,and that happened a day ago.I was only going out of my room to get something to eat or to relieve myself.today,1 or 2 hours ago,my mom and grandma came back home and i felt something was different in the house so i went out and checked.that moment my grandma reminded me of the thing he said and told me if i made my decision.i said i wanna have an education but i cannot focus and i need talk about my little problems everyday to be able to keep on going mentally.they raged even more.""my grandma told me either educate yourself or go work or ill call the cops and get you outta that house"".my mom said""me,your uncle,your grandma,your grandpa.we were all working and studying when at your age.we couldnt say a shit about our problems.and if you wanna go back to your dad and his family.be my guest.i find it natural.They are your family as well""

And while i was reading this my uncle texted me and asked why i dont wanna go to private teaching institution and i gotta answer him now

İ dont know what to do people.I hadnt had the power to do something for 9 months,it started happening a monthe BEFORE covid started.NOT with it.I got sad about something financial then covid just built up on it.of course i wasnt the best mental healty person in the last 3 4 years.at least it was ok you know.

Now i really have no power to do something about myself and thatll fuck me.if i try to keep on going to private teaching institution ill fuck up things at home even worse.if i dont it will still be fucked

İm reallyafraid of trying because i know there will be no use and ill just run out of power and break down

And its not just being scared situation i really have no power left to do daily tasks and responsibilities

But if it stays that way either my family will fuck me or ill fuck myself

My mother didnt raise me the way she was raised and the members of my family,was that a fault?im wondering if i took advantage of that but i was socially uncapable since 5th grade.i dont want to blame anyone for being raised that way and not being able to deal with my problems on my own.but i started to non stop think if i took advantage of her not raising me tough and now these are happening.an emotional,uncapable,dependant wreck who cant get things done alone

İ just dont want to feel alone.I got support from her all these years and life tired her a lot but i still need that help.if that ceases,sorrow hopelessness loneliness darkness just comes upon me.

I only have my mom,my grandma,my uncle,my little brother in my life,if they leave me,im done for.i dont want to be alone

İ actually want to cry for the last 7 days.I feel the tears are just behind my eyelids.my throat get often dry.i feel emotion rage but tears just done come out.ı wanna go hug my mom to feel safe but she wont accept me as the way i am anymore.all the family is like her.and i have no one else to talk

What am i to do people ha?how far will i go im not even able exist alone"
depression,"Don't isolate they say I .ca t see how not. My two sons might miss me a bit but really there is no one else that I care about.

Still living in the house but must end someday. Don't really enjoy much of anything, so I am best avoided, don't want to be the killjoy so I keep away from people,  Being ugly as well as having nothing of any interest to say so no one can like me anyway.

depression,"Losing everyone in my life and feeling completely lost and depressed. I got sober 5 years ago and I watched as all my friends stopped hanging out with me, I lost 20 friends and I became a social outcast.

I had one of my best friends who would always try and do something with me, but now even he has changed and I don't recognise him anymore. He is boring, akward to be around, and close minded to the point where it is suffocating, maybe I'm just. Ashit friend?

My two good mates have got girlfriends and never talk to me anymore, I pretty sure they don't know I exist anymore. I feel like im getting karma,because I did this with them and I even kept asking my best friend if had a girlfriend every time I spoke to him, I was a retard. I think I have gotten what I deserve.

My other friends got married and one of my friends wives told me she was only with h for his money, I didn't go to his wedding because of this and we hardly talk anymore.

My childhood friend who is like my brother has autism and is gay. His long term boyfriend gave him HIV and then the boyfriend abused a 10 year old boy and got me friend to take the blame for it.

My autistic friend is Facing 10 years in prison and is going to be convicted as a pedophile for this POS! He told me that a promise was a promise, he is going to ruin his life and he doesn't understand because of his autism.

He is currently rotting in a jail cell awaiting his unfair prison sentence in October, he is in England and I'm in Australia, I can't even get to help him because of this fucking virus.

The AA in my city is like a fucking cult,there are only 2 groups that are any good. The rest of the group's have turned all the young people my age into batshit crazy cultists. I hate them all and they know this, they stay away from the meetings I go to because they know how I feel about them.

I had 2 meetings I would go to but now one of them has an old bastard that has a resentment to me because I needed some time for myself and couldn't help for one single day! I shared about people like him indirectly and said "" they are sick people and I don't know what they are going through"" .

He approached me and was talking normally and said how good going to he country is to unclog the kind and get rid of negative bullshit, he then adds at the end "" you would about negative bullshit wouldn't you"" and walked off.

I stormed after him and told him if he needs to say something to me he should talk to me, he looked scared then so I felt like shit and good at the same time.

I have a criminal record thanks to my drinking career and I can't get a job and I desperately want to move away from the city I'm living in because I feel like a complete outsider, being in this city makes me feel depressed.

I have my own business, a family who loves me, savings, and I'm good at fucking, those are some positives I have, but fucking hell I just want things to change.

I feel like life is grinding me down, destroying my youth and making me feel older than I am! A 28year old shouldn't feel like a 50 year old.

It's just like I keep losing people in my life who make me happy and life keeps punching the happiness out of me, I won't give up or kill myself, I have tried and failed before! I vowed to just exist as a depressed husk in this world, I would live for other people until I could live fore myself.

I just feel trapped and my happiness is fading, I feel a crippling depression everyday because all the people I valued have gone, I feel so lost and u happy, I don't know what to do."

Be confident in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you feel like laughing. Treat yourself like a god/goddess because you deserve it. Hold your head up and keep your heart open. You're worth everything and then some. And always remember that no matter what, even if it doesn't seem like it, you're everything to someone. I was bullied for so long and was told that I wasn't beautiful, and it broke me down. But I realized that I am beautiful and so is everyone else.

depression,"I want to die i cant do this anymore I feel so bad. I dont know what to do. I cant sleep at night. I dont find joy in anything i do. I cant function without sleep and i cant even get it.

I hate feeling this way. I dont know how to feel better. I know I must take intivative and do and find things that make me happy but it is so hard. I know I have a full life ahead of me but i cant seem to grasp that fact. I feel bad again. Worse I have ever felt. I was afraid I was going to get depressed again and here i am again going through this shit. I dont know what to do to feel better. I keep trying to compare what I did before but the only answer was this therapy group I did way back that cured it honestly. It was like night and day i completely snapped out of it. But i cant go anymore because I work 1st shift and it was held in the morning. Idk if my body is handeling the new schedule change or if its my depression. Why am I depressed though? I have a job, a car, all the stuff i have wanted with my own money, i have family, couple of friends, cousins, going to school, pretty, young, i have my whole life ahead of me so why am i sad? Maybe i need time away from all the drama. Maybe I should go MIA again. I hate having to do anything like school, shower, go out with friends, eat. The only thing I like doing is eating, sleeping and laying down mourning. Why must I feel this way? I feel like complete garbage. How do I feel better? I just feel like this big low feeling in my stomach constanly. Im always worried about my days and what i will do with them. Im always feeling like complete crap. I wake up not wanting to get out of bed. And then when i do im just constantly feeling so depressed and miserable. My whole day is filled with my thoughts and idk how to think of something else. I cant even sleep at night its so bad. I try and find things that make me happy and do them but its either a temporary fix of my emotions or my mind wins over myself and i convince myself not to do them. Its like im trying so hard to stay positive but i cant seem to do it. Idk what to do. I literally dont do anything because i feel depressed. I dont even use my phone or go on social media because it makes me feel uneasy and unhappy. Everything I do its like theres a constant cloud of sadness under me. Its like i want my days to pass just so its 8clock and i can go to sleep. Literally nothing makes me happy and idk how to be happy. I try telling my mom and youre right our families are toxic because my mom tells me its all in my head and i guess shes right but i have no idea on how to feel better. She tells me im over exaggerating. Do you feel this way? do you have any advice for me so i can get out of this?"
depression,"22 years is enough. I apologize because this is a big block post. 

I’ve been suffering from different kinds of mental health issues since I was 8 (when I first started seeing a therapist). I’ve been struggling with dysthymia for basically just as long. I can’t keep living my life like this, trapped and unable to move forward. A few years ago, I was starting to get my life back together when I returned to an adult high school which is set up like a normal high school but with adults (so you’d have four periods and a lunch break and you’d need to move between your classes, classic stuff but unusual for adult high schools normally, at least where I am). I did really well there. None of my university stream math courses ever went below a 96% for final mark. In my last semester or two at that school I started to deteriorate again. When I applied and got accepted into my university of choice and program of choice (one of if not the most prestigious university in my country and the most prestigious engineering program at that university) I got lucky and was able to move to that city a month and a half or so before my first semester started to try and get as many resources and supports set up for both my mental health and learning disabilities. Unfortunately, it took so long to get everything set up and while that was going on I was dropping out of courses like dead flies dropping. My second semester was even worse. Went to a few classes at the beginning of the semester (out of my only two courses) and then never attended again for the rest of the semester. Even tried to get back on track during the summer with supplementary courses that I was supposed to take later on to make room for more of the specialized courses I wanted to take down the line. Unfortunately, I deteriorated so much that I ended up being hospitalized because if I had enough money for enough alcohol to go with the other part of my suicide plan and a nice final meal, I would be dead. So at that hospital I got ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy) treatments. The way it was done at that hospital was three treatments a week for a total of 12-16 treatments. I can’t remember if I managed to get my fourth before I had to move back into my parents place because I could no longer afford to live in that city and it’s about 4-5 hours away (so I don’t know if feeling better before returning was because of the treatments or another placebo effect like what’s happened every time I’ve started a new treatment which doesn’t end up working a few months in). I had to go through the healthcare system in the city that’s closer to where my parents live but there I had to start back at square one. It took about 6 months (or a couple more) to even get seen by a psychiatrist here. He’s tried a variety of drugs to no avail and we couldn’t go straight to ECT because of all the red tape in the healthcare system here (basically, ECT is normally only reserved for cases that are so severe the patient gets hospitalized, but I was just stable enough to not warrant going to emerge but not well enough to do basically anything, including take basic care of myself). It’s been about a year and a half now that I’ve been seeing that psychiatrist and I only just got a notification today that I should hear from a hospital specializing in mental health for my first appointment there in order to finally try more extreme treatments for depression (from my psychiatrist it sounds like my options may be either ketamine drips or ECT again). Unfortunately, I still have to wait at least 3 months before I hear from them (that’s after my psychiatrist said that he was almost certain I’d have an appointment with them before the end of this month). All that is to show what’s going on currently. However, the main reason I’m writing this is because I’m scared that those treatments ultimately won’t work or that I’ll get screwed around for another couple years before I get real help. Because of that, a little over 6 months ago (before Covid started) I realized that I kept having heavy suicidal ideation. I figured that I needed to stop thinking and planning to end my life and give my doctors a chance to treat me. So, I promised myself that I will put aside any consideration of suicide (and as much passive suicidality as possible) and set a kind of best before date (yes, that’s a terrible joke but whatever). I know that I can’t keep living my life like this so I decided to give myself and my doctors until my 30th birthday (which is in spring 2022), at which point if they and I haven’t been able to get me better an at least somewhat functional by then then that’s when I’d call it quits. There’s been a few things since I made this pact with myself that provoked some thoughts of suicide but I kept to the deal I made myself and kept on going. It may not be the healthiest decision I’ve made, but I feel like it’s an appropriate one. I don’t think anyone should be made to suffer virtually non stop for 22 years. Because I was just a child before my depression set in, I truly don’t know who I’ll be if I ever get better. From what I do when the weight lifts a bit for a few hours or maybe a day, I think I’ll like the person I’ll become (but I fear my adolescent rage will return since I won’t have the depression to temper it). 

Basically, I’m posting this to vent a bit. I could certainly go on with everything that’s happened in my life (both good and bad), but I believe I’ve expressed enough for one day. I just hope I get the chance to pull my life together and start being able to return to academia because my hope is to get my undergrad diploma for the special kind of engineering I wanted to learn, get a masters and doctorate in some field of theoretical physics (possibly a post doc as well), and then my end goal is to teach mathematics at the undergrad university level. I’ve been tutoring people in math ever since I returned to high school and have felt a great deal of passion and happiness at kindling people’s passion and insight into math. The biggest problem for me though, is that my depression and stuff have such a heavy impact on my cognitive abilities that I genuinely struggle to read and think like I used to. Before I even learned of rates of change in my math classes, I had already created the equation for the underlying principle of an integral (which I did know was a thing called a Reimann’s sum before I created that proof and used it to show the shortcut for integration of polynomials). I’ve done many proofs and derivations since back then until I was in uni. Now, however, when I look back at the work I’ve done, I struggle to understand what I’m seeing and understand the logic I was using. Even as I write this, I’m losing parts of what I wanted to write and my mind gets muddied up making it difficult to have properly formulated progression of thoughts. (I’m even certain that there were other points that I was going to make but I can’t remember them anymore.) 

TL/DR: I made a pact with myself to not end my life until my 30th birthday so as to give myself and my healthcare providers a genuine chance at helping me without things ending before treatments have had a chance to run their course. If I’ve improved enough to truly dedicate myself to learning again, then I’ll keep going past 30."
depression,"Truly considering suicide lately, for the first time in my life I've been having a bad year because of the pandemic but it was just an accumulation of bad desicions over the years. I realised I've never been truly happy for most of my life and probably will never be, I'm not he person I want to be and therefore I'm not surrounded by the people I want to be surrounded by. The best people in my life were pushed behind by my stupid choices, only the toxic ones remain. I have a horrible job and probably will never advance in my career if I keep having such bad luck and making horrible choices. I think I became a bitter person because of all this and at this point I think killing myself would be the best choice for everyone. I don't want your pity, I just wanted to write what's on my mind."

But the things I feel internally, it’s either so much or nothing at all. One of the main causes for my sadness is being split from my ex boyfriend again. It’s been two months and he hasn’t reached out even once. I don’t rlly wanna go into this bc I already have tears in my eyes but he loved me so much and had to break up with me to deal woth his own internal issues and take care of his mind. I couldn’t argue  with that bc he’s right.  I don’t know what else to say. I just don’t know when I’m going to finally be happy. I’m so unhappy with everything in my life.

depression,"Mom is a benzo addict and I don't know what to do anymore.  

I'm in university, but because of Covid we are studying from home. I've been stuck in my hometown for 6 months now. My mom has had problems with benzos since before I could remember. This morning she said she wanted to sleep for a while and now in the late afternoon I walk into her room and she is naked sitting on the floor trying to put shirt on but she is so fucked up she can't do that. She thought we were going out for lunch so she was getting dressed. She then asks me if there are any patients outside since she is a doctor. I don't entertain any of her delirious comments so I just ignore her and put her shirt on just for her own dignities sake.

All of my own failings I blame on her, I don't care if that's selfish. My social failure, my loneliness, my sex addiction and porn addiction, my lack of self control. In the morning I''ll phone her psychiatrist and tell her what has happened. My mom will lose her job, but it's better than her dying in car accident or slipping and snapping her neck in the bathroom.

These last few weeks are the first time I've actually contemplated suicide. maybe it would be best since i'm so fucked up as it is. Maybe I would deserve it. I think to myself the only reason I would die was to just leave some impression in the world. I don't think I will do it. I want to live. I just don't want to live like this anymore.

It's funny how antidepressants are the drugs that are promoted when they do just as much damage socially and physically to the person and their family.

Our government is corrupt to it's core and they rob us in the name of heavy taxes while we see no development anywhere. People here are the worst. Rude to everyone everytime without any reason. Somehow the people have accepted this sad reality and are content with it. Cases like George Floyd happen everyday here where nobody raises there voice against the corrupt cops. Coronavirus cases are on the rise over 2million and government doesn't give a shit about people anymore. They're opening up schools, colleges, gyms, theatres,... everything. I have recently learned that hospitals are being given above 1500$ for the treatment of each corona patient..so they are reporting false cases to extract that amount. The worse part is that the ones who actually have the coronavirus are being treated badly for about a week and are discharged regardless of being cured or not. So they can spend the minimum funds on the patients and have the maximum amount for themselves. People are even denied for ventilators. I realise what a shithole country I live in but I can't even say it out loud or else people would defame me or maybe even lynch me because of their false sense of patriotism. I want to get out of this country as soon as possible but I lack the funds to settle abroad currently. It may take 5years+ to acquire them. For now, the way the coronavirus cases are rising, and the inefficiency of our government and the ruthlessness of our vile people, I am having doubts whether I would live to see that day."
depression,"The loneliness is the worst Can’t help but feel like the worst part of depression for me is the feelings of emptiness and loneliness. 

Feeling like you can’t talk to anyone about your mental health. So you hold everything in. You distance yourself from your friends on purpose. You stop talking to friends, stop maintaining conversations. You think everyone dislikes you anyways so why bother. You feel worthless. You feel completely and utterly alone. 

It only makes you dig deeper and deeper into a hole until you can’t see the sun anymore. The more lonely you feel, the more you want to indulge in the sadness of being lonely. I wish I didn’t have to suffer through these feelings every day"
depression,"Why do they fight for life? The more I question the thing we call life, the further I get from getting an answer. I can't understand what drives people to live, is it family/lover,  their jobs, or to adventure. 
     But that's not it, if you take their family, some will  succumb to death but another will have a stronger  urge to live. OK then, take their jobs too, you would have more that follows the reaper but no where near the number that strives for life. Then take away their freedom, yet that still won't be enough.
     What is the instinct to live and for what reason do we have it. It not like life as an ultimate goal, you just live to die and create life to continue that endless cycle. Even tho my mind craves death as if it's a  delicacy, my body gains a will of its own when danger approaches"
depression,I'm worried that my depression doesn't count because I don't self harm I often worry that I won't be taken seriously
depression,"Why can't I hate people that hurt me? I've been struggling the past few months with a group of friends who gaslit me and then spread malicious lies about me to get other people to try to distance themselves from me.
I still have a good support group of friends who deeply care for me and have defended me. I, by no means, am short on people in my life who care about me.
So why is it that I can't bring myself to simply hate these people who deeply hurt me like I should and just move on with my life? Why do I want to forgive these people I'm certain don't feel an ounce of regret for making my life hell for months?
I just don't understand why, after everything that's happened, I still try to rationalize what these people did to me and feel the urge to forgive them for trying to ruin my life."
depression,"The fact of death almost excites me in a strange way. I’ve just woken up from my usual broken up, anxiety filled 6 hour sleep, and I was just thinking about how I was needing somewhere to vent.. and a thought crossed my mind, death genuinely gets me excited? 

Like knowing that all this non stop misery and pain will all just cease to be is so fucking comforting. I can say with almost 100% certainty that I will never take my own life, but holy shit.. I really do welcome death with open arms, at 20 years of age. 

Off to go work my 3PM - 11PM at my fast food job that I fucking despise oh so deeply today, that makes literally every aspect of my mental health worse. Hopefully my car gets crushed by a gargantuan truck on the way there or something. 

Cheers. 

Fuck sake man."
depression,"It just feels like there's a monster inside of me. I've struggled with bipolar depression for at least half my life now (since I was fifteen or so), and I'm so sick of it. I'm sick of having periods where I can't sleep, followed by periods where it's all I want to do. I'm sick of being numb to feelings of joy and happiness, yet able to feel things like anger and sadness just fine.

The thing I'm most sick of, though, is this monster that's inside of me.

I've lost so many friends because I can't control my anger and frustration. It's always some dumb thing to start off with, too; making a joke about Resee's Pieces, or a comment about Trump claiming that Paw Patrol was subject to cancel culture. My friend makes some comment that doesn't sit well with me, and then I just lose it. I get absolutely pissed off, I want to just destroy everything that made us friends in the first place. Then, when I've succeeded in pushing them away, this monster just turns into self loathing, hatred for everything. I still feel anger, but at myself as well as my friend. It doesn't go away for days, weeks even. It makes me do things that I would never want to do on a good day, it constantly belittles my friends, family, and me. It just destroys everything I've worked for in my relationships up until that point. 

I'm absolutely sick of it. I don't want to kill myself. I want to kill this monster. 

I've tried so much, too. I've taken up counseling. I've made myself a guinea pig for different medications. But no matter what I've tried, it always fails in the end. 

The monster always comes back."
depression,"A feeling that something has been missing- and I figured it out! I’ve been suffering with depression my whole life. But It wasn’t ever awful. My father spent a month in the hospital and passed away(I spent the entire month with him and was with him when he passed.) Not even a week after we buried him, by three month old son passed away. 

That was the DEEPEST darkest depression I’ve ever been in. 

When we moved to a new home there was an extra bedroom that I took on as my craft room. It suddenly became more. It was my space. Away from all of the rest of the world with no judgement about what decor I had or what nerdy things I kept tucked away, or the thousands of projects I had going. I surrounded myself with pictures and art of all of the things I loved. Every keepsake was in that room. I had a shelf for each my dad and Nolan with their pictures and a few of their belongings in a shadow box. I went into this room every night. At first I was working on projects. But then, I started doing things i did before the depression took me. I felt completely and totally at one with myself and that room is where I found peace. 

It was my one place that belonged to me and carried all my pain, but also had all the things I loved in it. It was like a room that catered to whatever depressive state I was in. 

When we had to move to a smaller house-job transfer- I gave that room up. This house only gave me a closet for my craft supplies. I’ve felt so out of sorts since we got here. I felt like I could never find peace or a place to sit and process things. I realized it’s because I didn’t have “my space” of all the things I adored and all the special items I own- along with all my hobbies. 

Today was my birthday and my husband transformed the large living room closet into a closet office. Complete with all the little things that give me that safe space/thinking space/ growing space/healing space. I have a desk, shelves, etc etc. It’s all organized. And I finally feel safe. I feel like I have a place to go late at night if I can’t sleep and just find a way to mull over things. 

This may seem absolutely crazy to some of you, but my little room saved me and I’m so glad that we’ve made that space for me here. 

I hope this provided someone with something that could help them."
depression,"anxious for no reason title says it all. im often anxious for no good reason. well, at least thats how i would describe it. i always feel as if my heart was beating stronger and faster than normal, and its a really unpleasant feeling. i can sometimes even hear it beating. 

never went to a therapist to deal with this, and i dont know how to cope with it, since every ""help"" page suggests things like ""be positive!"" or ""try not to overthink too much"", and they are not really helpful to me, since i dont find a reason to be anxious, im just. 

i dont really feel this as a threat to my life, since i once told my mum about this and she told me she feels the exact same thing as me, so i thought i just had bad luck with the genetics and had to get used to it. but recently, i went out for a walk after a long time of being in lockdown (4 months) and i began getting really really anxious and had a really hard time with breathing. 

so, do any of you feel the same thing as i? is there any way i can deal with this? how do i stop being anxious most of the day? and if i cant stop it, is there any way to at least making living with it easier and stop wasting all of my days doing nothing?"
depression,"im tired of not being able to sleep everytime i have something important i cant sleep, i need to wake up early and i cant fucking sleep

depression,"Why are depressed people so easy? Hey guys, this post/title might make you mad or sad so warning for that.

I have a genuine question about depressed partners or females in this case since I'm a guy and not gay. That pretty much showed same pattern during my dating life.

So I seem to be attracted towards the quiet girl in the corner, not a loud mouth, soft spoken and shy/modest. Most of the times (in my case) those are the people that suffer from depression. The relationship starts out strong when you show them kindness to the point of them becoming clingy. And that is fine. But after a while it seems like it disappears. After a while the compliments have very little and small effect, ""I love yous"" just become words without meaning. At first they are very happy but depression takes over and they become more grumpy by the day. The problem here is that, while your words and actions have no or very little effect, a stranger saying exact same thing will be the biggest thing for them and usually it will make them have interest towards them &gt; sabotage what they have &gt; go with the new partner &gt; repeat this cycle by getting another compliment from someone else and sabotaging what they have. This might be the reason of very low self esteem where they seek validation from others and try to get it wherever possible, online or offline which results in the ""body count"" sky rocket in very short time. Same pattern is shown on NSFW reddit subs where lots of ""models"" have cut thighs which is again associated with depression.

I'm not berating anyone or any choices they have made in their lives, I'm just trying to understand why this pattern is so common.
This [article](http://imgur.com/a/OkaDv9y) gives a better image too."
depression,"i don’t know what to do anymore i’ve struggled with depression for many years because of genetics on top of horrible environments i’ve been in. i see a therapist weekly and i always feel like it’s helping and tell my parents that it is but i honestly don’t know. the past two days i was doing pretty good because my parents told me some news that excited me. but all of a sudden i’m bad again. sometimes it starts from something that upsets me but other times my mood changes for no reason. i feel like people close to me are done with dealing with me because i’m a difficult and sensitive person but i try my best and i just want to disappear. i’ve had more suicidal thoughts this year than ever before. whenever things in my life are going pretty well, something bad happens and my mental health goes to shit. my family is really difficult and i constantly feel trapped. and i realized someone who i thought i’d end up dating (my best friend who i love to death) doesn’t have the same feelings anymore and idk what the fuck to do. i constantly self harm and even though there are certain things i want to do in life, i have an urge to be selfish and just end my life."
depression,"I don't know what to do about my depression. Ever since the Covid pandemic I've been in a low mood throughout the day. I can hardly motivate myself to do the things I want. I sleep for 12+ hours a day and wake up at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, still feeling tired. 

I've tried doing my hobbies (writing and drawing) but every time I start to do them, I feel a strong lack of motivation and I end up not finishing or not wanting to do them at all.

I feel pretty helpless in my situation because I can't go out to many places because of coronavirus, I can't relax outside, even in the shade because it's over 110 degrees outside almost everyday and I can only take so much of the heat. I feel trapped inside my house.

I want to see a therapist but I feel bad because my parents will have to pay for it. Or maybe they might make me pay for it and I don't have a job right now (and I'm scared to get one because I feel like my depression is going to mess me up and make me incompetent. I already feel like that anyway without the depression).

The only thing I really look forward to is hanging out with my boyfriend on the weekend. He's the only person I'm regularly talking to (I'm not good at making and keeping friends, and I have social anxiety). He's very sweet and supportive, and I feel like he's the only thing keeping me afloat right now.

I don't know how to get out of this situation. I feel so powerless and helpless. Nothing I do keeps me happy, I still feel empty inside at the end of the day. I don't know what to do."
depression,"I got dust mites/scabies, during the pandemic I caught dust mites/scabies from the communal couch and I can't cuddle with my new teddy bear or she'll get infected.

depression,"why cant someone love me already? my friends, they all tell me the same thing, that i should wait and that love comes on its own. that someone will eventually love me

i just wish i knew when...or even if it will happen

then i shouldnt have to wait around wondering if i really am worth it for anyone or not...if i knew then i'd know if it was worth it to stay or just leave already

im a fucking idiot arent i? at the beginning of the year i really had the feeling that this was gonna be it for me, i was going to make friends, study the career i love in the university i love, make friends, have fun and...well, i really had a feeling that finally someone was going to like me too

i really thought i was finally going to have a boyfriend that liked me for who i am...even if im not perfect...i was going to be loved too

why did i have hope?

i always knew that i shouldnt have hope, cause nothing ever goes how i planned it to...and yet i still thought...

im just an idiot

now i barely have friends, i cant even meet new people, i cant even go out or rest because of online exams and shit, im lonelier than before

...i really thought i'd finally stop being alone and now im lonelier than before...

sometimes i wonder why havent i killed myself yet...i should've done so long ago"
depression,"Living with a depressed parent  

Hey guys,

this thread is for everyone who knows how tough it can be to live with a depressed parent. Feel free to share your experiences and how you got through this.

My mum's depression started back in 2017 - it was fine after rehab for more or less a year but since 2019 depression is back. I'm a 22 y/o student and all I do right now is balancing my own life &amp; managing a 4 persons household. I love my mum and I know that she is sick, but it is also quite exhausting for myself. How about you?"
depression,"My family hates me. I'm turning into my mom and my whole family thinks so too.  Long story short: my mom was an addict. 

Her addiction was more severe. 

I'm addicted to pregabiln (Lyrica) and she was addicted to morphine.

I still feel terrible afterwards...

I've let my entire family down."
depression,"I've been thinking recently, my existence is making no contribution to society whatsoever. I'm not suicidal, however I don't see the point of me being here. Not working, not in a relationship, no kids or anything. Not really contributing to the economy in any major way, unless you include grocery shopping and buying games online. I just feel like my existence is pointless."
depression,"Depression and anxietY after drinking Hello, I am 19 years old and i starting to hate fucking alcohol. Everytime i overdrink my next day is full of anxiety, overthinking about what people might think of me and often i cry my eyes out. I drink maybe few times a month but seriously considering to stop all together even tho my friends would not understand me. I am not in the best place mentally (have been depressed for last year) and i feel like alcohol is only worsening it. I am constantly in fear someone will say something stupid i did whil drunk and i do not like myself when i drink. I guess i wanted to tell someone this because my friends would not understand me, anyways thank you for reading."
depression,"I feel I am a burden to everyone around me I struggle with depression and keeping a positive mindset. But when I get into bouts of negative thinking and self loathing, I feel even more of a burden to everyone around me. My habits and actions cause disappointment to those around me and I feel like a failure"
depression,"I’m just so sad and I don’t know how to make myself feel better this time. In May of 2019, things had finally started looking up. Even my psychiatrist was confident that I had tackled most of my mental health issues and was no longer insistent on seeing me. 

Then 10 minutes on May 2nd changed everything. Suddenly I couldn’t blink and I couldn’t smile. I couldn’t move the entire right side of my face. 

I went to the emergency room, and they said it was Bell’s Palsy and that it would be better in a month. It wasn’t. 

A month in they said it would be better in three months. It wasn’t. 

By September I had gradually regained a small amount of movement. They said I should be grateful. I wasn’t. 

At each appointment, doctors act like I should be thrilled that I can wiggle my ears again — before moving on to the fact that I can’t blink or smile at all. 

Each appointment they said they could intervene and fix the paralysis with surgery. After each appointment I cried, because hurry-up-and-wait is uncomfortable when you’re disfigured. But I would pull myself out of it and have hope that the next appointment would be the one. 

At my most recent appointment, they finally said they couldn’t help me. They finally said I would never smile again. I’ve spent the last year avoiding pictures and being unbelievably self conscious when I smile or laugh. Now that is going to be the rest of my life. When I asked for a mental health referral, they said no. 

Everyone always says that everyone looks great smiling and that smiling is always beautiful. At 24, I will never smile again. I will never be beautiful. Sometimes babies cry and children hide behind their mothers when I do my half” smile” at them. 

This time I don’t know how to feel better. This time there is no hope to cling to; no future resolution to strive for. 

I have been laying in bed doing nothing but crying and sleeping because in my house, no one can see how disgusting I look."

depression,"Happiness looks so far away that I just want to give up I am 25 years old and struggling with life so badly. First it was stress of finding a job then the person I saw as love of my life for years just left me in the middle of it.  


I am aware these problems aren't huge deals, I am not the only person who deals with them nowadays and they will all end one way or another. Maybe won't be perfect but will work anyhow. I know I will find someone else, maybe even better match to my soul. Yes, It is all going to be alright. But until then I live with a strong pain in my chest prevents me breathing sometimes and I can't deal with it. It stops me from doing things, making me lose my interest and focus on everything. Yes it will be all fine but everyday I feel more close to give up. Not beause it is more easy but because I feel knocked down by the pain. It is too hard to live by feeling that tough punch on the chest everyday. I feel like living in a coma and sometimes all I want is someone to unplug the machine keeps me alive."

depression,"I got fired on Saturday and it's really confirmed what a piece of shit I am. I don't have a lot of life skills in all honesty.

Doing anything seems to stress me out and I don't keep friends because I don't have the energy to spare. (I'm raising my 3 yr old daughter)

 I was just fired from my job because they scheduled me at 5:30 on Friday instead of my usual 3pm on Saturday and my anxiety was acting up so badly that I just couldn't go to see the new schedule. (I reached out to others to ask about it.) But anyway, I'm depressed. I'm tired constantly. My boyfriend is working full time and I just hate myself. I don't know how to make this better without just being in miserable pain and neglecting my duties as a parent and partner. I'm frustrated. I'm sad and feel useless.

depression,"Am i being ungrateful? My best friend found out her girlfriend was cheating on her and broke up during lockdown.   
Everyday i asked how was she doing and respected those days she didn't feel like talking . Tried to ask her to play AC or other games /movies/dramas together in order to keep her mind away from the issue . (We live in different cities)   
Once she sent me a message saying she needed to talk cuz she wanted to end with her life, so i called her and i was there for 2 hrs till she calmed down and i was 100% sure she wouldn't do something harmful to herself. Managed to make her laugh and she went to sleep.   


Months pass and she feels better, started to work again , meeting new people (which is what she needed)  But now i'm the one who needs help . We barely chat . Been asking her to do something together but she is busy (either at work, which i understand, or partying )  
Told her i was not ok with her attitude and she sent a deliveroo with food twice. Is not like i don't appreciate it , but what i needed was some time to talk, not food. She knows i'm feeling suicidal yet yesterday sent me a picture of a girl saying '' I'm talking with her \*wink emoji\*'' And i couldn't help but say ''cool''...

Hours feel like days and it's slowly killing me. I also learnt during the first week of May that one of my dogs has cancer, and it's really hard even though he's getting pretty old because my dogs are so important to me.

I met a girl at the beginning of April, we talked a lot and I really like her. I went to see her a few weeks back and even though it went fine, she doesn't want to get involved in a relationship and we basically don't talk anymore. I feel like she really helped during those months because we would talk everyday and it would just talk my mind off of things but now, it's like she doesn't want anything to do with me. Can't understand how you go from being really close two weeks prior to this shit situation.

I'm considering going to a therapist for help but I just don't see the point because I don't feel like it'll change anything. I already have a close friend that knows my struggles and the feelings i've had for the past months.

so yeah, this is basically it. My dog dying + The girl I like ignoring me + Everything in between has been making me feel depressed and I can't take it anymore."
depression,"You cannot help someone who does not want to help themself Okay, thanks. Now what? I know that. I know I don’t want to help myself. I don’t *want* anything! I’ve repressed so much I can’t respond to my real beliefs, just moment to moment pleasure and gratification. WHAT DO I DO NOW?! How do you make someone care who has more than dipped their toe in the “lay down and rot” school of thought? What’s the fucking answer?? 


Hello, therapist? Yes, this is anon. Don’t worry, we shouldn’t have to meet up too many times because I know exactly what’s wrong with me. You see, in a word, it’s apath–


Hello, how are you? Yeah, I know, it’s been crazy. Anyway, my name is Anon _____ and I’m thinking about becoming a client. Ok, cool, great, well done my main problem is that I haven’t been doing anything and I quit my job and school and such. Yeah. Well I just don’t really care. Yeah. I kno–


Are you accepting new clients cause the last two didn’t but I think it’s cause I gave off red flags. No, not like that. I’m just apathetic as fuck. Yeah. Yeah. No, I understand. Take care. Buh bye."
depression,"Fuck School I just cant do it, firstly is the fact im failing in school which i just cant do because all my other classmates are getting really good marks, ive tried studying and other methods but even when i do a decent amount, i still flunk and now im beginning to think im really dumb and and i dont really wanna feel that. Also, i have the most toxic friend group. I know theres such thing as banter but things such as them talking about fucking my sister and disrespecting and yelling at me is starting to get to me. Ive only realised this now but i dont wanna leave them because i have noone else to go to. Every morning i just dont wanna wake up because a miserable day awaits. I thought i had real friends who appreciated me but turns out they use me. Now i feel like an idiot"
depression,I Always Write a Long Wall of Text Here About What I'm Going Through But I Don't Post It Maybe it's just good for me to have my experiences written down in front of me. I've never had anyone take interest in how i'm feeling so i guess i learned to process things alone.
depression,"I've been depressed for the last few months, and I don't know if this is some form of advanced white guilt, but I feel everyday like I'm am evil monster just because I'm a straight white male. I'm not joking, sorry if it seems like this is a joke This is a throwaway account because I'm embarrassed to talk about it. Ever since the protests this year happened, I hate myself. I'm a Democrat, I've never been racist in my entire life. I never offend anyone. I never do anything like that. But when I see everybody oppressed or hurt by people who are like me I always feel so bad and ashamed. at first I thought the feeling would pass, but I feel everyday like I've been born into the body of a demon. I always see on other social media, people always posting on their Instagram stories to like donate to charities and stuff like that for BLM. But I don't have any money to donate. There's all sorts of posts about how awful white people are. and it's just like, I know I'm not who they're talking about, but they're talking about me because I just happen to be white. And I feel like if I go out on the street everyone is just going to think I'm some sort of evil racist guy just because of what I look like. And it makes me not want to go outside. I always thought that it was just enough to say that if you saw something racist wrong you would do something. But now it seems like you have to post things on Instagram, and Tweet and do all these things, to be considered a good person. And I thought I was a good person. But almost all my friends aren't white and those who are white are gay and I'm not any of those things and now I feel singled out. and when I sleep at night or at least try to sleep at night, all I can think about is now everyone must hate me just because of what I look like. I feel stressed about it, and I wonder if just genetically, I must be a bad person. I left social media, because it was too stressful. But it was mainly because people started posting ""racism is not touchy subject unless you are racist"" and I felt like everything that was going on was stressful for me and I don't want people to think that I'm racist. So, I thought what if I paid people to show I support them. But never thought people would think that was pandering, like I didn't think that they were capable of making their own money. And I don't want to feel so bad anymore. The worst part is is when I talk to people about it, they say I'm making someone else's movement about me. But that's not what I mean. I'm not racist sexist or homophobic, but I'm white and straight and a man, and that means im part of the problem and that means everyone hates me. And that means I ruin everyone's lives just by existing. And I'm very sad and I don't know what to do."
depression,"I lost my wonderful relationship because of depression. For the past 2 years, I was really doing great. I was living my optimal life. I've achieved a lot of my goals. This pandemic and job loss threw me back to depression. I've distanced my self from my loved ones. My partner decided to install dating apps to have her needs met. At first it was harmless until she expressed wanting to explore and being single again. My self-esteem was crushed and my insecurities resurfaced. I was being toxic. Depression created a gap between us. 

It's only been 2 months that I haven't been present in the relationship. I feel like she just waited for my weak moment to express that she doesn't want me anymore. I had to initiate the breakup because I don't feel valued anymore. I'm left with so many questions. I feel like I can't have weak moments anymore or else people i love will leave me. It's tiring to be strong all the time. 

I know it's not their responsibility to fix us or get us out of depression but what's the right way to navigate through these problems? I also feel like depression make us settle for less."
depression,"Emptiness. That's all I've really felt these few days, just emptiness. All I can think about is my suicide plan. I keep binge eating and cutting to try to feel something but there's nothing. Self-harm use to make me feel happy, even tho it was only for a short time, it still made me feel happy and drowned out my suicidal thoughts for the day but now there's nothing..nothing but emptiness."
depression,What counts as suicidal? I regularly think about suicide and don't care if I was to die of liver failure tomorrow but I've never said I was suicidal. I don't have any real plans so I just don't consider myself suicidal. Does thinking about suicide multiple times a day every day count? Or is that just kinda normal?

depression,"First time poster and hopefully more to come Hi everyone. 
I am never sure how to start these as I dont even write my feelings down in a journal or anything but let's give it a shot.

I am a 34 year old male, for the last ten to twelve years I have been getting anxiety and panic attacks that would come on heavy for a few weeks or so and then go away completely, but they would come back again in a year or two so just when everything is feeling great and I am moving forward I hit my hurdle again. Well this year we are back at my hurdle but this time it feels ten times worse than ever previously experienced... 

So a bit of background which I think lead to my first breakdown with panic attacks and anxiety. I had a dog called Spanner, Welsh Springer spaniel. I got him a few weeks after I quit the army with out every really giving it a complete go ( I am from New Zealand ) I tried for about a year with getting my fitness levels up to scratch to pass the entry requirements and basically once I was at base I felt home sick and wanted to leave. So i got home, my parents were upset because I was going no where and they just wanted me to find structure in my life. 
Moving on we got Spanner, he was my best friend for exactly ten years. He suffered with a low white blood cell count and the vets said he was suffocating slowly ( not getting oxygen into his bloodstream ) and I had to make the hardest decision ever by saying let's put him down instead of suffering. He died on the 14th Feb, the same day he was born ten years later. I never got to spend a special last day with him and even now after 7 years it makes my throat hurt and brings tears streaming down my cheeks remembering this. I miss him still to this day when I think of him.

After him passing away my life got flipped around a bit, my partner was working nightshift and didn't have a driver's license so I would get to bed about midnight, wake up at 2am, drop her off then get home and not fall asleep till 4 or 5 am just to wake up at 7.30am to go to university. This went on for about two months before my mind gave in I guess and the panic attacks came on hard. ( a bit more background but i used to smoke marijuana for several years before all this and was almost a daily thing ) Things got hard and I almost quit university, seemed like a big thing for my, giving up just when I get started. I even gave up pot because everytime I smoked I felt like I suddenly could not breath, like my lungs had no feeling during inhales and exhales which freaked me out.

Moving on I went on meds, even had lorazepam when things got to much. We moved from the flat away from the other people and drama and got our own place to rent. Still suffering while on meds my doctors increased my fluoxetine dosage and it went down hill, took lorazepam to calm myself but I felt completely immune to it and broke down crying in the corner. I stopped my meds and I dont know how but after awhile everything got better. It may of had something to do with a ex friend getting me some work with him doing mechanics and giving me some direction but after about a year I stopped or gave up, I dont know why. So for about two years things looked good before it all came back again.

It didn't last long, the anxiety passed quickly this time again and the only thing that may of had some bearing impact was my sleep being shit, getting less than 5 hours sleep for quite some time.

I started a lawn care business which I really enjoyed, it was hard work but rewarding and I was my own boss. It started getting hard as time went on, finding my clients was a challenge. At one point one of my bigger clients moved and I lost out on a 100 buck weekly job and that set me down a path of failure. I started to give up on my mowing business because of my own negative attitude suddenly. But not long after losing some work I found a new job which took some time to commit to but I did. I got a job working at a school looking after the school property, a care taker or groundskeeper position. Things where good, my partner and I were expecting our first kid, just starting the new job. 

Things are great. Fast forward and our daughter arrives, healthy all fingers and toes ect hashtag feeling blessed. Time goes by and we are happy, stressed sure but that comes with having a kid and learning everything that is new to us. My partner... I love her and she is my rock but she has her own flaws like me. So for over a year she quit drinking ( she comes from a family of alcoholism ) she quit when she found out she was pregnant and it  wasn't till probably after our daughter got to 8 months old that my partner started getting stressed and drinking a beer or two there. But that is how it starts right. Over time we argue a little about it, I say yes you can enjoy a beer or two but you dont need to get drunk, but that makes it worse. Come christmas I am non the wiser to it but she started having a early beer or more before we left for a family christmas gathering. My daughters first christmas and one hour into my partner is already had too much. My family is here and its embarrassing and it's supposed to be about the kids, not our selfish need to get drunk.

Move on a few months things are ok but then covid 19 hits the world. We go into lockdown and I am trapped at home. My partner gets drunk one night and I am having a sudden onset of anxiety with panic attack. Really struggling so I go to her for some comfort but she doesn't care, we talk a bit but she doesn't know how to respond or help. She blames me for something that happened about 8 years ago when I was to pick her up and I got there. Waited a few minutes and then left with out her, shes held that grudge for ever and says I dont care. So now I am getting my returns of it in a moment of need. It sucked. We spoke about how our love for each other has changed ect and things aren't great. I was sitting there listening and then got up, went to my car and drove off aimlessly for about a hour. My mind thinking well it's all over what now, is this going to be my last night here. Shall i just do it. Can I leave my daughter with her. Is it selfish to kill myself and never give my child a chance to know me, the good version not the struggling version. Things got better but then bad again and for the past 4 months it's been this horrible cycle of feeling good then feeling down. I struggle now with my own daughter who is 16 months old now. When she cries it hurts me but frustrates me and I just want to run away but then that hurts me even more. I feel useless.... i dont even know where to go from here. My partner and I have been working on our relationship but money is becoming a strain. I stayed home with my daughter for twelve weeks while my partner worked full time before it all became too much. Now here I am. Do i start my new medicines. Do i try find a way with out them. Do i just give up, do i pit a hose in the car exhaust and end it while leaving my family with that bitter memory. I dont think i can but i am scared because i have been thinking it lately. I have a therapy session this week coming up but Friday seems so far away. I've been getting stomach discomfort for the last 4 weeks and my mind races off thinking the worse, googkes answer is cancer which doesn't help my mental state. I have a ultrasound next week but that seems so far away it feels like the next few days are going to be impossible. Struggling to eat, feeling down, physically feel ill sometimes. I hate it.

Sorry it's a massive rant and a lot to read but thanks to anyone that is listening."
depression,"I'm tired of looking the way I do but too depressed to do anything about it I'm a college student who's gone through a whole lot, from family pressures I had to withstand since young to financial strain and the possibility of my future going to shit at any moment. I want more control in my life and want to start with getting my weight under control (I'm female, 177cm and weigh 104kg) because, next to my financial situation, it's the biggest thing that's bothering me now. What's stopping me? I have a busy life and nosy roommates whom I don't want to be aware of what I'm doing. I live in a foreign country for uni and people tend to stare a whole lot here. I can't go to a gym because of that, plus we're not allowed to do stuff like signing up for gyms and working without our admins permission, and of course, since we're our unis responsibility, they don't want us out there during the pandemic. It's better now but still.

So my question is, given all that, how can I motivate myself to work out and pursue a healthy lifestyle, with all these constraints? I already don't eat much as my weight has been consistent for months, so I would ask how do I get this done? How can I lose weight and keep it off?"
depression,"#Loveyourself "" I'm the one I should love in this world.

I honestly would never exactly understand what you all are going through. Because we all deal with things differently, we cry differently. But I can relate to things on basis. AND NEVER COMPARE PROBLEMS WITH PROBLEMS!!  


I won't comment shits like I care for you because honestly we don't know each other at all. Even the username is anonymous. But I can guarantee that someone in this world cares your broken yet beautiful soul. You will get better not for someone else but for your self.  
Take breaks for yourself &amp; reward yourself. Try to think about a better future and work for it.  
Dont be too hard on yourself. You can be you greatest strength and weakness. AND DONT OVERTHINK.  
I wont promise things will get better but I promise you will get better.   
Please don't do anything bad to yourself.

depression,"The monotony is killing me slowly I go to work. Get told to just watch tills. I clean ice cream scoops. I wash the utensils. I serve ice cream. Clean scoops. Wash the oven. Serve a bunch of people. More ice cream. More cleaning scoops. Wash down surfaces. Clean oven trays. Scoops again. Go on my break at 5pm. 20 minutes later come back. More ice cream. More serving customers. Wash scoops ... if I’m lucky I get off tills to sweep the floor. 10pm we go home. I make my tea. Feed the dog. Watch YouTube. Take dog for walk. Play a little PlayStation. Go to bed. 

And the next day do it all over again. Every. Fucking. Day. 

I’m sick of it :( I hate serving customers when all I want to do is hide from people. I hate pretending to care about the ice cream they all want to stuff down. I’m sick of the place I work at. I never do morning shifts. Always shitty back shifts and it means my life feels like the days just keep resetting. Nothing changes. I just go from work to home and that’s it.

I’m sick of it. I want out 😭😉"
depression,"A year later and I still miss my friend. A year ago my closest friend took her own life, around August 15th i believe.  She was the best friend i had and even after so long, i still miss her.

I feel pathetic, like i shouldn't be grieving after so long but i still am, it doesn't feel like it ever gets any better, every day i wish i could have done more to help her, maybe if i said more instead of completley freezing up not knowing what to do, I honestly feel useless, like i just can't feel better about it at all, we used to talk every day but even a year without that still hurts like hell.

Combined with other things going on in my life, too personal to get into here, i honestly contemplate ending my own life like she did very often"

depression,"Having one of those severe life threatening panic and anxiety attacks I lost my dad recently and since then my mind has been creating all the negative situations I could be in henceforth. 
Right from 'what if I lose my mother too' to 'what if someone kills me and my mother'. 
I have absolutely no control over my mind and body right now. Like I just want to have tonnes of sleeping pills so that I don't wake up to reality. I have zero strength left to fight my negative emotions. I don't know if I would survive this phase or would be dead before it ends but I can't help myself right now. Nothing is working out. I'm having sleepless nights, continuous headaches. I'm literally trembling out of fear. I don't know what future holds for me but before anything happens, my own fucking mind will kill me.

I don't know what to do. I often get severe stomach pains, fainting in which I could vomit, urinate or defecate while unconscious. I get chills so strong all I can do is shake and stare. I get vertigo so bad that I just grab on to something and tremble as everything spins. And while any of the above is happening, all I do is worry about who I'm pissing off by being unavailable to work.

depression,"Tried hypnosis to relax me and help me sleep but it only made me depressed I fought depression twice, once when I was really young and an other time as a teenager, and since then I’ve been a lot better. I’m also seeing a therapist who told me I’m no longer in depression but stil have depressive symptoms.

This one night I had trouble falling asleep and I searched for relaxation techniques where I stumbled across self-hypnosis. I decided to try it out. 

It relaxed me at first but the more I do it the more I start to feel like I’m depressed and that I’m worthless. The scarier part is suicidal thoughts are starting to come back.

I’m scared about this. Something that’s suppose to help me just ruined my progress of getting better."
depression,"I always feel low and for no reason i feel sad and depressed all the time and for no reason. I used to have alot good friends but now i feel like whoever i was friends with counts me as an acquaintance. I have friends but not a single person i am close to or share my feelings with i feel so lonely and out of place. I feel like everyone hates me for whatever i do. I feel like everyone is judging me for every single action i make. I read books to feel good but end up thinking how alone I am in this world and how I can’t share my feelings with people I’ve been friends with for more than a decade. Not a single person in my 20 year life has been close to me, and i come from a family where the emotion of affection is very very rare. I have no idea why i keep feeling sad while I aspire to be alot more happier"
depression,I caused my brothers depression I was so mean to him growing up. Yelled and got annoyed at him for the most trivial things. Called him names when he didn’t deserve it and he NEVER said one thing bad to me back. He is the most amazing and kind person I know. It breaks my heart to know that I may have contributed to his depression. If I could go back and change everything I would... Is there anything you guys would do to try and make up for all the terrible things I did?
depression,"I don’t know why I’m like this. Over the span of about 2 years, I’ve become more and more depressed. I’ve suffered loss, a break up and the uncomfortable realization that I’m going to be alone forever. I was a happy, outgoing person who loved people. I wasn’t popular, but I was well known to an extent. Slowly but surely I started drifting off, ended friendships, and it’s gotten to the point where I feel uncomfortable socializing, making my depression worse. I shouldn’t have to experience me being a 14yo M. I don’t know what to do anymore, but fuck the standard. Fuck normality, all I need is help. I can’t function properly anymore.

I am 30 years old and have suffered from depression since I was 10 years old my dad died suddenly when I was 10. He was fine in the morning and then went to work and died that day I was pulled out of school and told about this and my world literally came crashing down. It was like being in a cage and screaming for help with no one to answer you or help you. I have lived in that cage for years and still do not know how to get out of it. 

I miss my dad terribly and even feel like I am a failure of how I live my life and feel like I should be better for him and he was so well educated and so successful. I know he would have given me a life that I could feel proud of instead I am working a low wage job and am pretty uneducated. Just feel so depressed all the time and have mini breakdowns regularly. I have had counselling but it does not seem to ever get to the substance of why I keep beating myself up and feeling like a child inside myself a lot of the time.

depression,Depression episode and confusingly in-love/crushing I'm your average looking straight male in his 26 going through a depression episode. This is every common for me as I had it since I was 13. This time it just so coincides with a very confusing time for me... as I'm hopelessly crushing on someone of my same gender. I knew I had some tendencies but never paid attention to it as it never manifested the way it has now. This is completely new to me and its messing me up.

depression,"My depression is killing my business, my marriage, and me But I can’t afford any mental health help.  We’re in a mountain of debt and trying to keep our small farm afloat.  No money for insurance or medication.

It’s like I’m watching my world crumble around me and I either can’t or won’t do anything about it.  I hate myself so much.  I could have a good life, if we could only get out from this debt.

I want my husband to see me and my pain and actually react to it.  All he does is ask me what he can do. Or offer to go find a “real” job again so we could pay the bills, at least. But then I’d be the one who killed his dream of a farm for the rest of our lives.  I can’t take the pressure of running this business, taking care of my recently widowed mother, living in a tiny RV, and trying to maintain a marriage.  It’s too much."
depression,"I've been depressed for the first few hours when i wake up my whole life, and 2020 made me tired of it. When I wake up to go do anything (and I mean literally ANYTHING) and/or wake up early, I am depressed for the next few hours until the day really gets moving. Since I've dealt with this my whole life I think it could help explain why I have never been hungry in the morning or why I have always taken over an hour to thoroughly get ready for something unless it is later in the day.

Since it has usually only ever been in the morning I always dismissed it but 2020 for obvious reasons (political, covid related, and, subsequently, my home life) makes more than just my morning depressing. So now I have little reason to want to continue tolerating what the internet seems to call ""morning depression"".

I want to clarify I am not diagnosed with depression and don't think I have it since I feel better as the day goes on. Not good, but better. I mean, of course I've been kinda hopeless/anxious/feeling depressed lately but I want to believe it is just because of 2020 being the year bringing all of our negativity to the forefront. If/when the state of the world and the various political tensions affecting me right now ever get better, I think my overall mood should get better and things/people I used to have a passion for will seem enjoyable again. This is the main reason I haven't sought therapy or a psychologist. The other reasons mainly being because I won't have time once school starts again nor the money if I actually wanted solutions and treatment with a real professional if I had depression. Since I never had these issues pre-covid aside from the ""morning depression"", I wonder what advice you all in this community can share or if any of it is, at the very least, relatable. 

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest."

depression,"Anti depressants and 'brain fog' I've been on meds for several years now, and one of the side effects I seem to suffer from badly is 'brain fog.'

Whilst tablets keeping me on the straight and narrow, it's to a point where I've felt almost like I'm sleepwalking through life and I'm weighing up coming off of them and - mental illness aside - being 'myself', or carrying on life through a daze with my mental health problems at bay. A lot of my depression ties in with social anxiety, which has a knock on effect as to worrying how I'll be portrayed or act if I come off them and stopping me from seeking a different form of therapy (seeing a counselor, as an example.)

I did self-harm once, but almost got caught by parents so i stopped.  i developed insomnia and find it lucky to get 4-5 hours of sleep, i stopped studying entirely and my grades dropped  immensely because of these feelings. i tend to get upset when i don't see scars on myself when falling or doing something dangerous (thinking i deserve to be hurt), i no longer have friends since i pushed them away. it takes me 3-4 hours just to get out of bed in the morning, and i tried ending my life once.  i stopped trying to live/function like a normal human being seeing there's no worth in even trying anymore, i stopped eating entirely and only do so once a day which is at night, i developed anger issues because of this. the severe loneliness is not making it any better and honestly my life is a mess.

i thought i was actually depressed until i saw the subreddit r/im14andthisisdeep and everyone's views saying this is just a phase every 14 year old girl goes through and it is invalid. (not just this subreddit/platform, a shit ton others plus tumblr, twitter etc). after months i became THIS close to exploding. not knowing whether it's just a stupid phase all go through or this is legit. i've stopped trying to reach for help cause i get scared i'll just look like 'another edgy 14 year old girl looking for attention'. i can't even say the word im so ashamed. So, i'm asking, am i just another edgy 14 year old or are my feels valid and should be taken seriously?"
depression,"Why???? that's all I wanna know, why did you cheat on mum? It's all your fault and my fault too. Here's a rant to the shit depression my fucked up mind. [Cheating] [ED] [Bullying] [Neglect] [Self harm] Sorry if the titles overwhelming, I couldn't think of anything else that'll catch ur attention. I'm so tired of no one caring and it just makes me not want to care too but I can't, I just got to care, I just got to overthink, I just got to be sensitive.  I'm sick if repeating the same things in every post as I have to go through a whole rush of memories again to write everything down but I'll try to state as much details as possible. Feel free to search my post history to know the fucked up shit corona brought this year.

1st...why dad, why?? Is lust so important that you need it so much in life. Couldn't you just sleep with mum. I've seen porn of older people age 60 having sex and yet both you and mum have zero sex life. Be it when you guys were 40 or now 50+ yet does no sort of intimacy between you two. What more mum sleeps on my bed downstairs and u sleep alone upstairs. God Ive never even seen you guys kissed. Why? Is it because mum was too busy with work she ignores her duties to satisfy you? Is it that you got bored of her? Is it that your too embarrassed? Do you just wanna let go of stress? Just tell me why??? I was 14 when I found out you were cheating and now I'm 17 and it's still going on. U ruined my life. I love you so much, I wanna to make u proud, I looked up to you, I bragged about u but now , I can't even stand talking to you without memories of disgust.

2nd...mum why??? I know career is important but why did you give birth to me if you were just gonna leave me??? U left me with my maid to pursue ur degree. I know u struggled but don't u remember the nights when I was 4 u used to blame me  for ruining ur assignments. Did you know how that me feel? I felt like a burden, and all I wanted was ur time but I were too busy with making money and so was dad. U left me when I was 13 to 15 to work and study and work out of state. When I needed u the most u were busy, I missed u and I needed someone to talk too as I was bullied but I were too tired to listen.

3rd... Oh fucking donkeys in the world that love to bully people!!! Fuck you seriously.. u have no idea how much bullying impacts someone. If I could set karma on you and lit u on fire I honestly would, coz I deserve to die for bullying people. If ur reading this remember BULLYING IS NOT A JOKE, IT FEEDS UR MIND AND KILLS U SLOWLY. I was bullied since I young due to my weight. My family, my brothers, my friends, and my relatives it's all your fault that I have an eating disorder. If only you had kept ur mouth shut instead of making comments about my face, and if only you hot girls hadn't made me feel disgusting I would have never started purging. U slapped me , punched my nose and poked my fat and then I laughed. U have no idea how much it hurt inside. 

4th... Now both of you... U still continue ur ways but now ur both sick. Ur life spans have been shorten and as much as I'm mad at you two. Ur still my fucking parents and I love you too so much. I don't wanna lose you but at the same time I just want things to change. To have an actual family relationship. Owh and I can't stand another hospital trip.


5th... I thought I could stop. I thought things were getting better but I just feel so sad and today during my exam I only managed to answer 2 out of 10 questions. I'm gonna fail. When I called my mum she was mad but in reality she has no clue how much sorrow I carry inside because of home. Its been a few days since I last purged but tbh that's one of the things I can't stop thinking about. Everytime I eat or if I'm just sitting I'm so body conscious and when I look at my arms I just wanna cut them off. I just wanna hide myself and I hate the way I look. Now compared to vomiting I'm constantly thinking of cutting myself recently. Just to escape from everything. I feel so stupid as I used to be an A student now my life's a mess and I'm confined in boarding school unable to do anything about this shit.

Just some consoling or advice would be nice... Thanks for reading my rant..I know some people have had it far worse, I'm sorry for being selfish but I just had to tell the world. I'm at my breaking point and I'm not brave enough to tell this stuff to my parents or get help."
depression,"Does it get better ? Hello there :3

Pretty much the title. 

I think I might have anhedonia but due to various circumstances I cannot get tested for atleast another 6 months or so. 

I find no meaning nor pleasure in pretty much everything I do. It's scary/boring to live life like this. 

Can someone tell me ?"
depression,"So I'm going to have to go a full week without my medications.. I just spent 20 minutes on hold on the phone to the doctors, only for them to answer and tell me they can't even call me back to order a repeat prescription. And I'm working all week so today is the only day I could sort this out..

I not only need more antidepressants, but I need a change of sleeping tablets because I'm not sleeping..

So this next week is going to be fun.."
depression,"I just want to take this off my head First of all apologies for my english ( I live in Mexico), and this is also my first post in reddit so please be nice

For the first 12 years of my life I have been one of the happiest most loving person of all my family, I had a lot of friends and could maintain a healthy relationship with most of them, I was good at school and my family always said that I was highly above average in my intelligence, because I always could remember stuff or always had the answer to one problem, but as the years kept passing by I became more distracted and couldn’t remember even the little things, I started getting bad grades and I became more self aware of my capabilities, I really wasn’t that special, I realized that I was just pretending to be smart and really all I was doing is impressing other people with bullshit info that I was never going to use or that I really didn’t understand, this problem kept on growing and because my family thought that I was joking and that I was pretending to give up on things just to get attention , really I wasn't motivated on anything at that point, I started to get more and more angry on my inability to perform basic human functions that I fell into a really severe depression, of course I didn’t showed it because I was too scared to disappoint my family or my friends, the weird thing about it is that there where days that I believed that I was the pinacle of human intelligence and others that I just was plain trash and that i deserved to die, this feeling was so strong that I believed that there where to different persons each with its own mind and personalities, and because of that constant pain of not knowing how to act or what to be or what to pretend to be, I just gave up, my family thought I was crazy because of this, they didn’t understand my pain and just kept laughing about it, they think I’m like this because im atheist but its really not.

 (I’m okay with you believing in what you believe, I think that all people have the right to believe in what fullfills their happinnes)

now I’m 16 and I’m not sure what I’m doing in life, everyday I get up to school knowing damm well I’m not learning anything and I’m not  going to have a stable life in the future.  
I hate everybody but mostly myself because I’m too scared too pull the fucking trigger that will end all of my suffering, I don’t know how to better myself.

I know that I’m capable of success but my brain is comfortable being a fucking piece of trash, I guess for now I’ll just keep on living on and pretend I’m not in a complete fucked up stated of mind."
depression,Why doesn’t anyone really care I’ve always been able to see how much someone cares behind what they say. I’m so tired of the empty “ how are you” and the “I really care for you” like cmon now your just sayin that to make yourself feel better. So you feel like you did something. I want a person who really cares to ask me how I’ve been n what’s wrong. But I’ve been waiting on that for years and it still hasn’t come. I’ve given up all hope an no longer care about this world
depression,"How to explain SSRI withdrawal and Depression to SO? My girlfriend has never really been depressed, nor has she taken medication ever. I, on the other hand, have been on Zoloft since age 12 (21 now) and am just now taking charge to my mental health. Zoloft hasn’t been working for a while, I have been numb for a long time and depressed. I now am slowly weaning and moving to Lexapro, and have scheduled my first therapy appointment. To me this is a huge deal, but I feel as though my girlfriend doesn’t see it. She told our mutual friend that she thinks I am not making an effort to better myself right now with my withdrawals and switching meds. Friend responded on my side, as she has taken my side and told her I’m essentially just taking it day by day right now. I would really like to have a constructive conversation with my girlfriend regarding how serious it is, and how weaning off medication I’ve been on for years isn’t something I can just do and continue doing things I did before for a while. Does anybody have experience with this, and does anybody know how to have a conversation about this and how I’m doing my best / any helpful links on how SSRI withdrawal effects you?

TL;DR - Girlfriend doesn’t understand SSRI withdrawal’s side effects or depression’s side effects. She thinks I am not making effort to push through withdrawal when it is physically and mentally draining me right now. Need advice on how to tell her it’s not something I can just ignore and perhaps links to articles on withdrawal or depression."
depression,"I'm fantasizing about cutting again for the first time in over a year and I'm so scared. It's been over a year since I've done any kind of self harm. I've been doing really well for months even with shutdown but the last four days have been so awful. Nothing bad has happened, but I'm so miserable, and angry, and I don't know why. 
I miss the feeling of cutting I want to do it so bad. I need the sharp control of it. I don't have control over myself I'm freaking out. Why can anything feel like this...

I'm not suicidal yet but I'm scared I'm going to be. I've been doing so well and I hate going back to this feeling. The past 4 days I've stayed in bed past noon it feels awful. I miss people I miss the escape that it offers... Help I don't know what to do"
depression,"I don't feel like there's a future. So, you know that awkward moment when you tell someone you care about that youre still on your medication but you don't see yourself living much longer because you can't imagine going on. And then, they don't even acknowledge that you're reaching out for help. 

I'm sure maybe she just didn't see the message, but it was something I haven't told anyone and it makes me feel like she just doesn't care.

But that's how I feel and I don't know why. I'm still on my meds, though I took my last dose today and the pharmacy doesn't open till Monday. But I'm worried cause it feels like somethings changed. I used to think a lot about my future after college, but I can't even imagine it anymore. And now it's affecting my grades, if there is no future for me then my grades don't matter. Even though I know I need to do well.

It probably doesn't help that our school just stated that next quarter is going to be all online classes too, this extreme lack of socialization is actually numbing too me. I'm not the most extroverted person but I still like meeting new people, especially with wanting to pursue a relationship. Idk it just all feels so pointless right now."
depression,"depressed because i can’t cum out of my ass and puke out of my cock ever since i cummed my first time when i was 11 i just felt something wasn’t right. when i was 12 i realized what was wrong, the cum didn’t shoot out my ass. it sounds retarted but i became depressed because i couldn’t feel cum shoot out my butt. My brother is gay and i let him cum in my boy pussy and it still didn’t feel right. When i jerked off i puked sometimes and it felt wrong that it didn’t shoot out my cock hole. Life isn’t worth living when cum doesn’t shoot out your ass and you don’t puke from your cock."
depression,"Difference between not caring and just being dumb I just started with my first class in com college. I noticed something unfortunate about myself. Every guest speaker talked about their experience with high school and how they did terrible in academics. At first, I start to feel better about myself because I personally can’t do well in academics. Then they start explaining why they had terrible grades. It’s because they couldn’t care about their grades, or they aren’t motivated. 

This really discourages me about how I am. I can’t help but feel jealous about their ability to just change their grades if they were motivated. I wish I can go to class without having to feel discouraged about my learning curve. 

I struggled so much in high school not because I didn’t care, but it’s because I feel incompetent in all my classes. I can’t process informations like others. No matter how much I studied, asked help, talking to my friends about the assignment, I’d always felt way behind everyone else. I slowly push away my friends who were smarter than me because their success just made me even more depressed. 

“Hard work is the key to success” they said. Its fucking bullshit to me. Those words were suppose to motivate me but all it does is discourage me. I’ve worked so hard and yet, I feel like I have the common sense of a 6 years old. I feel sorry for my mom for giving birth to me. Wish i never was born to begin with."
depression,"Read this.  You ever just don't want to get out of bed, feel like an unproductive human being, and it feels like everything in life is going wrong? Its okay, I feel the exact same way. The best part about it is that we can work through it together, don't worry. I love you you and care about you, don't let depression take over your life and work on it day by day. You don't have to go through this alone."
depression,"Pyschotic Episode? I have these episodes where I’ll feel mad and start crying. I’ll shake and rock myself back and forth while laughing. I suddenly get the urge to cut and experience pleasure from my pain and others, through watching gore. What do I do about this?"
depression,"Im starting to dive in depression, losing everything. I need help. My 8 months long distance relationship girlfriend that I saw regularly broke up with me yesterday.
She took a train for a 1 day trip to meet me and tell me what she felt and how it wasn’t going to work out because I’m going even farther than we were before (moving from France to Québec) and that she lost the feelings she had for me.
I’m devastated. I still love her, and I dropped everything I had with my friends so I could enjoy at least two weeks of summer vacations together before I would be gone for North America. While losing all my friends, I will also be losing the person that I cared about the most, the person I have so much good memories with, everything was gone in a few hours all my world came crashing down yesterday.
I was scared to tell my mom I haven’t seen since January that we ended things because she loved her as much as I do.
I had so much planned for us during this month, I kept remembering her to take the tickets and she kept telling me that she would but she didn’t, I knew something was going on she was also texting me less.
I knew it was coming anyway. That one day we would have to stop being together because of me living on another continent, she told me that It would mean a fresh start for us both, that I could enjoy my life out there without worrying about her. I respect her choice, and especially the fact that she came to see me one last time in person to do it, and not over text. We had one last long hug and she left.
I texted her about how I feel, I’m deleting the photos I had of us and throwing away her gifts, she told me that we can remain friends and that I can take as much time as I want to recover from this, and that I can come see her if I ever happen to be in the same place as her. 
I’m reaching for help, for people who had a similar story or just help on recovery"
depression,"What should I do? I live with my family, my parents are pushing me to get a job, to do housework, to get off the f\*\*\*\*\*\* laptop. I can't get a job, and I don't give a shit about housework, chores, ""things that need to be done"". I have friends, thought I'm not seeing them much nowadays and every time I speak to them online, the next time just feels more terrifying. I don't want to speak to them any more. My school sucks, I hate my courses, it's a drag to do anything. To top it all off, I'm stupid, and can't remember a thing about my courses. It just feels meaningless. I have no skills, no ambitions, no hobbies, no desires (and no money to spend on these nonexistent desires). Every time I think about doing something I realize how pointless it is. What's worse is I know that there are people in much worse situations than me, people who actually have problems, people who make something of themselves despite those problems. I don't deserve to feel this shit when there are people out there who suffer hundreds of times more. Am I insane? When is something going to happen? What should I do with my life? I can't do anything. WHAT DO I DO? I can't speak to someone, they'll rightfully point out my selfishness, either that or they won't understand. I just find I'm closer to snapping every day. Every bleeding day. I wake up, I go online, I'm told to get off and do something (I don't do anything, but I get off because it would be harder not to), I walk the dog, I go back on, I eat, I eat, I sleep, Repeat repeat repeat. There's no point to me trying because I give up as soon as I've started. I don't think I've achieved a single thing in my life. And I don't want to. What should I do? Can I do anything? Is there a point to doing anything? 

Sorry about the rant, I'll probably just delete this later. For now... idk"
depression,"I’m sad for the world Before all of this, I felt bad about myself for failing at getting a college degree and not living up to my parents expectations. It seems so trivial now. People are losing their friends and family more than ever, tenants are getting evicted and thrown on the streets, the middle class is withering away, not even just in America. And after all this is over we have climate change to worry about, especially now that we’re seeing a lot of changes in the worlds eco/weather system. The world has become a harder place to survive in."
depression,"Lockdown is destroying my mental health. I am depressed for last 2 years. There never was a day I never imagined of a suicide every three months I had a job. After so much struggle, I got a job in January, I thought this was it for my bad times but I was horribly long.

I lost the job again in April. Had to move in back with my parents. There is nothing good about this. Back to same destructive thoughts. My parents as any Asian parents doesn't have a capability to understand that there's something called mental health. They seem very tense and play victim but everytime we talk, they tell me they're very tense for my situation but I just think it would be alright if I just would've been earning money.

They keep telling me regarding all the hardships they've been through for me and I agree, it was financially tough times and that builds up even more expectations from me and I'm failing. They keep making me realise this. That is hurting me so much, I feel like I'd be better off without existing. But again, I have to live for them. I can't do that to them.

Sorry for rambling. Idk what to do."
depression,How to fight depression and suicide thoughts in war alone I am 19 years old . I was born in syria and i am still in syria . I have been fighting depression and suicide thoughts for 8 years straight until it almost led to my death and we don't have therapists here . The war itself was too much for me and after getting out of the hospital  i have lost hope( i had to go to the hospital because of a heart attack but then i had pulmonary shock with bacterial infection in my lungs) and i really don't know what should i do to survive. I have lost hope and i had to sacrifice a lot for so long . What can i do to stop myself from ending my life
depression,"going through rough times i’m thankful for my life, and i understand how some people aren’t and i don’t have a problem with it, i just want so badly to make the most of myself. but i can’t. i am depressed, i have had suicidal thoughts, some days more than others, but i haven’t attempted or anything. i also have a lot of anxiety. i also have a lot of addictions that i don’t want to get into. i am not currently seeking help but i’m willing to look into it eventually if i ever feel like it. right now though, i’m just not in the mood to go see a therapist. i’m not really in the mood to do anything. i tried changing myself, pierced my ears, painted my nails, bought new clothes because i love fashion and stuff and it was a nice time but now i’m just kinda insecure about the changes i made because of what someone said. i know i shouldn’t care what other people think but i do and it just gets to me sometimes especially late at night. 

i really just want something more in life right now. i am purposeless and just bored and really sad. and like nah i’m not gonna kill myself or cut my wrists but i’m kind of fucking up my own life a lot and i don’t really understand what’s happening. i feel a lot of pressure from people around me so i distance myself from them, but then i get sad because they’re gone. it’s hard to find people i can relax with. 

i feel generally uninteresting these days honestly. like i try to talk to a lot of new and old people but i feel like i just have nothing to say or feel like i have too much to say. all of my social interactions have been pretty stressful lately. lotta anxiety on that front which really furthers my depression. i have a huge fear of talking about my problems too much which i feel like i do a lot because i always have problems. i feel like most people view me as crazy so i don’t really like to talk to people that know me, which is why i branch out to the internet a lot for friends. 

i’m going to be real i think i’m just at a really confusing time in my life. a lot was flipped on me. i feel really emotionally worn out and like unable to heal from it. and i feel like i am going insane but i gave up on help because i’m an idiot and self destructive. i somehow believe that if i party and get fucked up enough and talk to enough people or get attention that i will be happy. i have great memories and good times but when i’m alone or at work i’m not happy at all like i’m completely drowned in misery and like everyone’s just used to me being like that. everyone just tells me to get meds and then blames me for not taking them but they just don’t work for me. 

i just wanted to also mention that during these difficult times i am having good experiences too. i’m thankful for my youth and that i still have potential in life. i’m sorry for those of you who no longer have that feeling and want to end your life. i will stay strong for you always and i won’t ever say i have it worse because i don’t. i’m not mentally stable enough to help people and i don’t have good advice, but everyone trying to get by has my support. i hope tonight you all are safe and thank you for reading."
depression,"I’m so frustrated. things have been getting worse recently, and it’s the little things that really push you over the edge. I stripped a screw. that’s it. and now I’m sobbing full on thinking (and knowing) that I’m stupid, that anytime something seems to be going well for me, I have to ruin it in one way or another. 

and to make matters worse, I go onto Instagram while crying and see that my friend group from school went to the beach without me. didn’t even ask. it was a whole post of a collage of various Polaroid pictures of all of them, and pictures of them lying on the beach. 

I never get invited anywhere. 

I’m always the one to initiate conversations. 

no one ever reaches out to me. 

I don’t necessarily want to die, but I don’t want to be anymore. I’d just like to not exist. 

yeah everyone would be sad if I disappeared but it wouldn’t have any impact on their day to day lives. maybe except my family."

In the middle of June I check myself into the ER for suicidal thoughts and spent about 6 days in the psyche ward of the hospital. While it was mostly a neutral experience I think I made the wrong choice seeking help. I should have just ended my life.

I have good days, great days even, but so much of my life feels like it has no purpose. I just don’t care to do anything that benefits my security. I’ve maxed out my credit cards because I don’t care to pay my bills and my unemployment hasn’t helped (lost job due to the pandemic). I just turned 30 and I feel like a huge fucking loser. I don’t care if I just sit and do nothing all day. I’m sorry if this isn’t the place to put this but I just had to get it out. I’m just frustrated with myself. I don’t want to die, but why can’t I get myself to want to *live*? Why is it so hard to just motivate myself? Sigh."
depression,"I just had a weird experience with my depression So I’ve had depression for a long time, since i was about 14 and have only been medicated for it for about a year, and for years it went undiagnosed but its pretty fucking obvious that i had it. Anytime I go through any kind of heartbreak or break up it gets dramatically worse (which is probably pretty common but im just tryna provide context). 
Anyway today I got rejected by a long time crush. It was devastating and I struggled to complete the day. I went so far as to have a really long and bad dissociation while driving. I also struggle with suicidal thoughts pretty often and this was amplified today. I honestly was thinking about it for about 10 hours more or less. Not making any concrete plans to kill myself but abstract situations in which I could see myself committing suicide. I did the typical “mom would be sad” bit and how my friends would be devastated and how i’d miss out on my d&amp;d campaigns, which as usual worked enough to bring me out of dissociation. 
But right as I was slinking back into my suicidal thoughts, my brain just connected with the thought “when you die there is nothing. Absolutely nothing and no one. And you wont even be aware of it.” And it snapped any and all suicidal thoughts out of my head immediately. Theyre just... gone. I don’t understand what happened at all just now. I mean I’m glad I’m not having suicidal thoughts anymore but i’ve never had this abrupt of a removal of such thoughts. Its like all thoughts of killing myself got bitch-slapped out of my head. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?"

I'm living in iran and I'm just tired of everything, suffocating in my own dreams, my dreams may be stupid to some people bcs it sounds easy, like havin a normal job where i can make just enough money to live in a small place alone. 
I'm sick of all these lies about my country like iranians are terrorists, iranian people are not terrorists but our government is. Or about the price of 1 single dollar being 40,000IRR but 1 dollar here is 220,000IRR. Why am i talking about dollar? If $ price goes up, everything's price will go up aswell, I'm 20 years old and i still don't have a car, FFS i don't even have a driver's license, it's funny right? The average money a person can earn monthly in iran is 20,000,000IRR it might sound like a lot but no, 1 pizza is 500,000IRR, getting a driver's license will cost u 8,000,000IRR. So how much is a car? The worst car which will become thin as a paper if it hits a wall is 500,000,000IRR, what would you do if u were me.
We are a family of 6, 5 of us work every single day just so we can pay rent and loan fees.
I quit studying when i was 17 and started working bcs my dad was fired from his job bcs of bladder cancer.
Every money we saved went for his treatment and fortunately he lived.
I work 14hrs every day, and honestly i don't know what to do.
I dont want the normal life most people want like making a family and living happily ever after, this is nothing but a fairy tale to me. I thought about giving up and go jump off a bridge but i don't want to ruin my family's life more than it is right now. I wanted to leave this country but i don't have 2,000,000,000IRR :)

I think this is the first place where I feel good about putting this stuff here I will do more of these when I feel down. I just had to get this put thx for reading.
depression,Honestly don't know what to do. I'm 26. I started college in 2012. I have 154 credits with a 2.15 GPA. With my remaining classes I'll graduate with a 2.4 MAX if I ace the remainding 12 classes in computer science. I was in denial for so long when one of my doctors asked if I was depressed in 2014. I laughed and shrugged it off. Now in 2020 my aunt (a nurse) concerningly told me that she believes I have depression. I honestly don't know what to do with my life or turn it around. I have $34K debt and don't see myself graduating or getting job related to my field even if I do.
depression,"I don't matter Nothing I do has no real effect. I've been disassociating alot. I don't think anythings real anymore. All I do is drink to feel better and smoke weed to feel better. I feel like shit no one really cares about me. recently all my friends got stripped away because the two biggest people in our group chat (Me and Jake) got into a fight so no one talk to me. kids now adays say ""Oh im so alone no one cares about me"" and they say it so like 20 people swipe up and say ""omg shut up I love you more than anything"" and then when I say I hate my life no one loves me and I'm sorry, but imma kill myself only 2 people slid up. I tried to overdose and landed in a psychiatric hospital. The one person I wanted to talk to was my ex who just broke up with me and I couldn't I needed her but she wasn't there for me. I just now realized that I will have no impact in the world I hafve no talets I don't like who I am pleaes help me. I just feel like no one loves me"
depression,"Why do some people overindulge with depression, and others under indulge? Sorry if that doesn’t make sense, what I mean is that some people will do everything in excess, while others will do the opposite and starve themselves of everything.

It seems that depression can cause someone to either eat 5k calories a day, or eat 100 calories a day. To drink a fifth of vodka, or no vodka. To sleep 12 hours a day, or 4 hours a day. To socialize with as many people as possible, or nobody at all. Take too much medication, or none at all. I hope I’m making sense to get my question across, and I realize nobody is the same when dealing with depression, but I still see this pattern. 


When both people suffer from the same illness, and feel similar, why do we act so differently?"
depression,"Nothing special/unique to say today Been feeling more down than usual. Sad and lonely you know. My work suffered a lot this week.

I’ve been longing for a romantic relationship but I can’t bring myself to make an effort. I doubt anyone would want anything to do with me, and I’m worried I’m just toxic now. 

Idk if I’m actually suicidal or if it’s a fantasy. I dream of suicide every day though"
depression,"My family and friends have no value to me People i considered family or friends have made my life so miserable and targeted me for nothing but laughter, in life all i wanted was to have a happy life and be loyal to these people but they just didn’t care at all. 

My traumatic family events don’t happen much anymore but it still irritates and horrifies me, it makes me want to not meet them ever again and not be around them. 

I still have a lot of shit just in my head but wasn’t too sure where to start first i guess."
depression,"I think I may be suicidal but every time I try to think or talk about it in a deeper sense I get over whelmed with feelings of guilt and self hatred. Almost every day for the past two-three years I’ve been feeling to what I think I’ve come to know as passive suicidal thoughts(?) I don’t actively want to die but at the same time I just want to stop existing completely, so that no one would have to hurt because of my absence, and I feel so selfish for feeling like this and it makes me hate myself so much more and now I feel almost nothing and the closest thing to happy i feel is peace, where my thoughts aren’t screaming at me telling me I’m the reason my family abandoned me when I know it isn’t true. My best friend tried killing her self last February and what she did devastated me but she’s living with me now and I know it would do the same to her but I just want to die so badly. I think of all the ways I could go out, it’s like an uncontrollable lust. I just wish someone or something would do it for me so my parents and friends won’t feel the guilt of me killing myself. Am I wrong for feeling like this, therapy doesn’t work anymore and I feel like I’m slowly running out of options. I have a very good life and there’s so much love in my immediate family, but both my parents struggle with severe depression and bipolar depression. I’m slowly struggling more and more to see any other options."
depression,"People tell the most truth when they think they’re joking with you Hi all, first post to this sub.

I struggled with depression for a long time. Only recently I’ve come out of the fog and really started working at my life to better it. So at the moment, I wouldn’t say I’m depressed. But I’m fresh out from under that rock. 

One thing that happened during my depressive state was I stopped eating. I was smoking a lot of weed at the time and that really messed up my appetite as well. I don’t know how much weight I lost, quite a bit. I’m a skinny guy to begin with, but going in I had some muscle on me. I lost it all. Unfortunately I also happen to struggle with my body image because I’m naturally so scrawny. 

People tend to make jokes about how little my arms are or how skinny I am in general, and I know they mean well because I’m an extroverted guy, they’re just messing with me. But, like I said, unfortunately my body is the one thing I’m really self conscious about. And what happens is I’ll start working out and start to feel like I’m making progress and someone will come along and remark at how skinny I am and just wreck my state of comfort about my body. And, like I said, they don’t know that that’s a touchy subject for me so I don’t blame them at all. And it’s not like they’re wrong either.

On top of that, all the gyms are closed (or if they’re open I’m not going) cause of COVID. So I’m stuck at home doing exercises that, while beneficial, aren’t the type of muscle building exercises I could be doing. 

But, I’m holding myself to working out three times a week (cardio on weekends) and I’m taking CoQ10 and Whey Protein everyday. Hopefully within a month or two or three, I’ll have a foundation of muscle that I can build on when the gyms reopen.

I don’t know how on or off topic this post is on this sub, this is more of a venting session if anything. 

Anyways, I hope all is well with you all and that your difficult times soon resolve."
depression,"I'm completely empty. I don't think I've been genuinely happy or sad since I was 10 or 11. I just feel... nothing. I still have my sense of humor and will laugh at things I find funny, but it's only temporary before I feel empty again.

Not only that but I've always put a mask on my personality to fit with the social situation or group. Even with my own family I put on a mask that makes me seem more joyful. 

I don't think I actually have my own personality by this point; and if I do I don't remember what it's like. When I try to express my feelings when I'm by myself and there's no mask on my personality, it's all negative. Just negative thoughts and feelings. But not sadness or any actual emotion, just negativity in general.

I'd go to a therapist but I feel no desire too. If someone were to express that they wanted me to go to a therapist, I'd go. 

I haven't been diagnosed with anything besides mild schizophrenia that was fixed with taking medication for 6 months.

I don't mind the thought of death, but I also don't desire it. I think I've lost the ability to desire anything at this point.

There are a couple things that make me cry, but if I actually *try* crying and letting my emotions out I stop. Maybe a tear or two at most.

If I were to desire anything, it'd be to feel an emotion for more than 5 minutes. Just, something. Sadness, anger, etc."
depression,"If this goes wrong if this goes wrong i’m killing myself. i don’t have a choice. i can’t face my family with it. it’s in some stranger’s hands whether i live or die and i’m just so tired. i don’t know how to do it because i’m afraid of brain damage and shit if i live. i don’t want to kill myself, i don’t want to live i just wish i would not wake up and not notice. i won’t care that i’m dead once i’m dead"
depression,"I'm so tired I have posted here before, a long time ago. 
And I filled my little list of small things. And i kept trying. 
And I've been... getting by. 
I'm still working from home. And it's terrible and busy and abusive.. 
Side note: please be nicer to your tech support workers. 

But my list got short. Then it got long. Then it got short. 
It went back and forth.. I don't have alot of friends.. actually. I have none. 
All my friends are online, on Final Fantasy 14 with me. 
But I've been in and out of wanting to just.. quit. 

I'm so tired of struggling. Trying to find love and someone to be with after my abusive ex.. And i haven't. I have in a way. But he's not.. he's not interested in me. Not like that. 

I find myself using 14 to escape. I'm part of a role play guild that is a teahouse, and there. My life is incredible. I even got in game married.. But I couldn't even tell you his actual name. Just his in game one.. it's shallow. And logging out. It's gone. 
In there I have friends, I have a house, I have money, I have cute outfits. I have a husband... And it goes away. 

Is it really so bad to just want to give up? Is that really the worst thing? I'm just so tired. I'm exausted trying.. I know I'll never be the richest person in the world, or the CEO of some big tech company. I don't have dreams like that.. I just want to be loved. I want friends.. I want a small apartment. 

I want to be told I don't have to be strong anymore.. 
It seems like anytime I take a step foward. I take four back. 
And I'm just tired of it."
depression,"Paranoia when drunk? Have you ever felt paranoid when drunk?

A few years ago I had something called amphetamine psychosis. It’s temporary, but as wild as it sounds. 

Now, I have issues with anxiety and self-esteem. Drugs of course exacerbated it. Medication and therapy. But that incident flicked a switch. 

I abstained from drugs minus alcohol, but even 6 months later, I would have strong delusional paranoia when drunk. I’d imagine friends were doing or saying negative things about me. Glances or looks while I’m not looking, etc. 

I’d say it was only anxiety manifest, but it’s stronger than that. I have a very particular feeling that my eyes are glaring (like when you’ve had too much coke) and heavy feeling in my stomach.

I eat well, gym, practice mindfulness and have used therapy.

But now it’s come back. I’m abstaining from drugs. But I’ll have 2 glasses of wine and feel it again, stronger.

Anyone any ideas?

I’d say it may be mild symptoms of schizophrenia."
depression,I don't belong and it hurts Going to a job I'm too old for. Fat and old. Just going forward hurts and I don't know where else to go. I'm not happy when I'm around anyone but.. Ugh!!
depression,"I dont want to upset anyone by dying, I just want to stop existing I don't know if I am suicidal or not, but that is just how I constantly feel. The more I live, the more I realise there is absolutely nothing that is worth living for, that absolutely nothing makes a difference. I mostly continue to exist because dying will make others uncomfortable, sad. But the sheer burden of life is just too much to carry sometimes. I have become so tired of it, I am so tired of fighting it."
depression,"I wish i had one person that i could just go to and feel loved... I want for even just a day, to feel genuinely liked by someone, and not feel like they're just trying to be nice..."
depression,"Coping with recurring depression I had a check-in phone call with a GP yesterday. She suggested that depression will probably continue to come and go for the rest of my life and I need to learn to cope with it.

It is a gloomy thought that I might only have three or four months out of a year where I feel okay. Also, the more times I am depressed the more chances there are for me to do something stupid.

Has anyone else (Ideally older than 40) had a similar prognosis? I don't want to feel like this for the next however many years."
depression,"I don't belong, send help I'm too old for the job I have, it's killing me every day and I don't know how to move forward. Please help. I really can't keep this up and it hurts a lot tonight."
depression,"Idk how to fix me I feel like theirs a switch in me between ok with everything and just sad. And most days it’s sad but I pretend to be happy for the people around me even though a lot of the time it makes me feel worse. I’ve thought about going to therapy before but I’m almost pressured not to because I’m in a leadership position and I can’t let the ones under me see me asking for help. I went to see a counselor once and I felt guilty about going to see him. I feel damned if I do and damned if I don’t. I purposefully distance my self from friends an family and feel sad because of it but sad feels right. Idk am I crazy, am I always supposed to feel this way, should I just suck it up like I always have?"
depression,"I'm a failure in life My brothers are living on their own and have girlfriends and they got in university on their first attempt...

And then there is me, still living with parents, have no boyfriend, didn't get in uni even tho I had better grades from highschool than my brothers...

I feel like I'm a big failure in life and I don't know why I'm living bc I'm just pain in the ass for my parents."
depression,"Tonight I opened up I finally let it all go. I told my dearest friends, who are my chosen family, all about my desire to die. I told them about my most recent suicide attempt with tricyclics and my desire to do it again. They sobbed and held me. There were no secrets to be had. I cried to the point that I lost my ability to breathe. My hurt became their hurt. And for the first time with these people, I felt so fucking selfish. I never wanted to open up this way. They are strong and supportive and willing, but I don’t want them to have to be. I want to be alone in my own sorrow and misery. I want to die alone. I want to suffer alone. And I won’t change my mind."
depression,"Breakdown I am having a breakdown and feeling really down and alone. It feels like the worst time possible to be having one because everyone I normally talk to when I am having a breakdown is asleep as it is still early morning. I have been crying off and on for hours now. Nothing I am doing is helping, I have watched tv, a movie, cleaned(it’s weird but it helps me calm down), played video games nothing worked. I just want to feel “better”. I just want this to all go away."
depression,Meet up Wouldn’t it be neat if we could all meet up in person? Hypothetically of course. There’s a damn pandemic and we’re all on this forum for anonymity and the advice of those like us. However ... if we all met in person I feel the energy would be immaculate. Where you you guys prefer? I’d say Joshua tree California or Colorado Springs (:
depression,"im really close to relapsing rn honestly i found a razor blade earlier and tested it on my hand, it was so clean and i liked it. i stumbled across a askreddit thread sbout the worst things that hsppened to a friend, i couldn't stop reading, snd it just made me wish i was them, or took the place of them becuase good people dont deserve death and im not a good person. i dont know whats going on in my own head anymore. i told my boyfriend about my obsession with gore and he went silent. i think he thinks im weird. i just wanna feel something sometimes"
depression,"Untitled. For a long time I’ve suffered from depression, and growing up in my toxic household had really taken its toll on me. I became emotionally numb and distant, and over the years I couldn’t stand the constant emptiness that I experienced day in and day out. I became obsessed with finding things that made me feel no matter how bad it was for me. Whenever I find something that triggers and emotional response it becomes a drug for me until it no longer gives me the same feeling. Most of the time I can’t tell exactly what I’m feeling but sometimes it as clear as day and I feel euphoric, but lately I’ve been finding less and less triggers, and my health isn’t helping. I have a few things that trigger my emotions, but I know they won’t last long, and don’t want to go back to that emptiness."
depression,Lonely  I used to adapt my personality to the people around me. Recently I've been being myself and ive lost nearly all my friends in the process. Im extremely lonely at the moment and my mental health isn't so great. I've tried to make new friends but hasn't worked 🙃
depression,"ECT treatment Hey guys! I’ve suffered from depression since i was 13(I’m 22 now). It is a very aggressive depression and most of the times I can’t control my behavior. So long story short, I’ve tried every treatment with SSRI,SNRI,antipsychotics, some of them combined to amplify each other and not only that non of it worked but it all gave me only the side effects. I’m currently 35kg+,kidney problems, i have a liver of a 50 year old and i take Lypanthyl to treat it and “diet” so my last shot is Electro-convulsing Therapy. I have no otber choice but ECT. I’m scheduled to start the first seance in a couple of days. If anyone has done this procedure or heard of it..can you give me your insights? If this fails, I might even suicide for real this time."

depression,"Misconceptions about depression. I recently posted a video on my social media where I was enjoying myself (taken down now) and people were so quick to tear me apart for being happy. We can feel happiness too, I’m not in a constant state of sadness where I want to end my life, and it’s unfair for me to be painted as a fake because people don’t understand. 

It’s so much more than prolonged sadness over a period of time. I can go for days feeling like a completely normal human being, and then this wave of sadness hits and I forget how to function. Sometimes I can be fine an entire day, and suddenly it’s like a light goes off and I want to crawl inside a hole and die. 

Everything was perfectly fine just minutes ago, I was listening to music in my room and dancing around like a lunatic, now I’m devoid of all emotion and I don’t feel the energy to get out of bed for the day."

If by fuckimg miracle it's just pure void after death then life will be fucking good then. Oh so good. So good that I'll probably become conscious and happy again and reincarnate into another bullshit planet. Fuck this fuckin world.

depression,"I don't deserve my husband I love my husband, I love him so much. He the first person to not call me crazy for my panic attack, the first person to not leave me when I open up about my fucked up life. The first person to forgive me for the lies I said to mask my life in the past and hug me saying it was ok. I love him so much. Yet I feel like I dont deserve him. I'm lazy, I'm fucked in the head. I lost so many people because of the way I am...I'm dramatic AF and cry for everything. Always feeling like the world hates me. I have lost so many jobs, I lost so many friends, I've lost so many dreams. I feel like I cant do It anymore. Sometimes I just want to end it all. I sometimes regret meeting my husband, i feel like i shouldn't have spoken to him. Like i shouldn't have approached him. He deserves better, not someone like me. He does his best to love me and care for me. Yet I feel like he deserves a woman who is not mentally unstable like me. I sometimes cry so hard when he is not around because I wish I could be someone so perfect for him, someone who successful, someone who is great at speaking to others, someone who isn't scared of fucking up every beautiful thing she touches...I dont want to fuck him up. I love him so much. Sometimes I wish I could go back to the past to stop myself from meeting him. Then he wouldn't have had to wake up at 3am some nights to comfort me. He wouldn't have had to worry  about my panic attacks. He wouldn't have to worry about my depression or my anxiety. He wouldn't have to worry about me at all. 
   He would probably had met a nice girls. Who is normal and not unstable. Someone who made his days much brighter and much more enthusiastic. Someone who can keep a job. Someone who is successful and sociable.
   I just wish that he wouldn't have gone thru so many things because of me."
depression,"Motivation leaves me paralyzed Hi all,

As far as I know, I have been in and out of depression for about 10 years now, never clinically diagnosed until now, because my parents were not supportive of getting help for mental issues. 

Now that I know, I shared with a few friends, because i was told it helps to talk. I also started therapy recently. 

For some reason, everyone (including my therapist) keeps trying to ask me to do something. Listen to music, go outside, get sunlight, clean your room, read a book. 

I know they mean well, but it just somehow sucks the energy out of me and leaves me paralyzed. I want to desperately stay alone and not be watched or judged all the time. 

In the end, I end up snapping at them to stop asking these things of me. They just give me stress instead of motivation.

Is this common? Has anyone experienced this? Were you able to get over it?

Any help is welcome. Thank you."
depression,How long do sertraline side effects last? How long do the side effects last after you stop taking sertraline and do they all ever go away completely.
depression,"Here is my life played out Wake up ,  I  go to work, become absolutely drained of everyone and be anti social at work , be anti social and do nothing when I get home. Work out. Distract myself with boring shit. Eat. I end up dying alone as a virgin and never getting loved or in a relationship. This is only if I dont kill myself.

2nd path is if I am homeless which is possible soon. I'll use my last money for drugs. Hopefully overdose and die. Hopefully hell Is real so I'll burn. Fuck this fuckery dumpster hell hole world."

Pretending im happy but im really not
Got me thinking of life and death alot
But i fought againts it alot because i know life cant be bought and i must keep it in veign to help me through the pain 
I say to myself always be here tomorrow otherwise your family will die of sorrow and life cant be borrowed so thats the rule i must follow
Sometimes i feel like shit stuck in a  bottomless pit thinking about death and i cant ignore it
Thinking about being dead inside my head while im sad on my bed and i always say well said because i know i dont want to hear it because it makes me upset"
depression,"The true meaning of helpless. I have finally understood the true meaning of being helpless. I am someone who always believed that humans are beings capable of bettering themselves every moment of their lives, and I have been trying to live with that creed.

But recent turn of events have given me a new perspective. A few months ago I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. I was getting better. Fast forward a few months I broke up with my ex, thinking that would help both of us. We were in a toxic relationship and I wanted to help both of us. In light of the decision, I do not know whether I am doing the right thing anymore. I have these thoughts that I know are bad but I do not have any control on when or where they exist in my head. I want to be happy and not sad and empty, but I feel as if I am frozen in ice. I want to get better but nothing works. I have lost the true joy in the things I do, and if I do it I have to force upon it myself. It's usually autopilot and that doesn't help me. I am a natural born overthinker and for once I want to stop overthinking yet I have no control over what my mind wants me to think. I am in a constant battle with myself, and I fell this fight is different from before. For the first time in my life, I do not know what to do at all. Should I see my psychiatrist? She will tell me that getting better is possible and I know it all too well. I know its not my fault that I am this way but why does it have to be like this? I have all the tools to get better and I know all the things I need to do. Despite so, it has not made a dent in the past days I have been trying to get better. I have always lived my life searching for answers to every problem and have been keen to always share my experience with anyone that also needs help. But this one... Nothing in what I have been through can help me figure this one out. 

I now know the true meaning of being helpless. It is having all the answers and experience but there isnt an answer nor solution for what I am going through. It is wanting to be better and trying to be better but constantly getting beaten down by your own dark self that you have no control over whatsoever."
depression,I physically cannot get up from bed despite not feeling the most terrible Just what the fuck is this disease doing to me??
depression,"This is my last shot So i saw that meme about the are you winning son and he got the highest score for a depression test lol. I took that and got the highest too, same with the anxiety test.

It's been a while since this started, like 5 years or something and things have changed, some things are gone but others appeared same with people. 

Its hard to believe for me that at some point i was ""ok"" i used to not worry about anything and the future was clear but it is not. 

I can't even thing I've fallen down so much, not what i used to be or what i thought i was but yeah i know something is not right, i can feel it inside me apart from my horrible body transformation, seriously I can't even concentrate about something, I can't even stop for 3 seconds and think. I don't even know if i can recover

I finished high school a couple weeks ago, now what? I feel so bad about that, feels like wasted time, 3 years of wasted time, didn't even got ready for what's next so what was the point of it? I used to have projects, kinda life projects you know, things that you would like to do, all of them have died. I really dont have a purpose or an objective.

I don't want to blame my parents for all this, me and only me are responsible for what happened or will happen in my life, no one else. But even then they never really helped me with anything, only paying the school but again, for what? All the things that i wanted to do they never helped me, they want to control my life and that sucks. I told them that i wanted to work and they won't let me its just so stupid 


So that's it, i just don't know what to do, i feel awful, I dont have nothing to do or to work on, every day is worse, i can't sleep

But there's one or two last things i want to try. So wish me luck
If it doesn't work i think its over."

depression,"I’m so overwhelmed to the point where I feel like I’m on the edge This is my first time really ever talking about this so this is most likely going to sound like a mess. I feel like I’ve been a self-centered asshole my entire life. I’m only 17 and I turn 18 in 2 months. To put it quite simple, I’m angry all the time, I’m sad, and I don’t care about doing anything. I get angry at the smallest things. For example, my friends not wanting to hangout or do anything makes me get angry at them. I don’t know why I act like that. My parents are also very angry people so that could be a factor of why I’m angry but I’ve tried my best to disassociate myself from them for the last few years. Another thing about myself is I hate my life for the most part even though I feel quite privileged. My family is wealthy, I live in a good neighborhood, I have a lot of cool stuff, but I hate the city I live in (Seattle) and I feel like my friendships are just going to eventually wither away because that’s what happens every time, plus I’m guessing my friends are in favor of one of my ex-friends over me. More than anything, I just want to sell everything once I turn 18 and move back to my home country of Australia. I feel it’s ideal to just start a new life in Australia and make up for lost time with my family there. At this point in this post, I don’t know whether I’m making sense or not (it’s 5am). What I need is some sort of guidance more than anything. How do I stop getting so angry every minute? Why am I so fucking sad all the time? Should I leave my friend group? Should I move? I’m really stuck and I’m incredibly overwhelmed. I’ve literally never been at a point like this in my life with this many relationship/emotion issues considering I feel like I’ve had to be my own best friend most of my life."
depression,"I didn't take a job. I'm worried I'll never get one. It's been a rough ride. I finished my grad school classes in 2018, but took some time to finish my thesis.

Prior to that, they spent 4 months keeping me on the line of 'your interview went well just let us pick a day', I kept interviewing and eventually had to threaten to withdraw my application. Prior to that I spent two months in an abusive work environment before quitting. Last month I had a job offer, but it was in a city that's been struggling with COVID-19 levels and they couldn't guarantee I'd still have a job if they had to shut down again. I couldn't take it.

And one day she randomly told me that we won’t work out in the long run and I asked her why and she never told me... so I started getting upset like “why would you say that” and she got even more upset that I got upset even though I don’t know what I did.. and now that she’s gone I just don’t feel like life is worth it anymore.
depression,"TW, how to bring up suicide to my therapist How do I bring up to my therapist that I’m having suicidal thoughts? I have been talking (over the phone) to her for a while now and I’ve always had these thoughts but have never been honest enough to tell her, I feel anxious about bringing it up because I’m worried she’ll get the wrong idea when it’s not really a big deal because it’s more ideation"
depression,"feel like I’ve lost all progress from overcoming severe depression So I’ve struggled with borderline debilitating depression for about 7 years now. That coupled with moderate anxiety coupled with being in an abusive relationship for nearly 5 of those 7 years made me a miserable unproductive mess who could barely hold down a job for a few months at a time. 

Spring 2019 I decided to to go back to college after meeting my current bf. I finally had real achievable goals and dreams for my future and for our future together. Things that always seemed impossible before. I was finally learning to stop holding myself back. It was a slow agonizing process but I really felt like I was doing better in actual measurable ways and feeling happier and better about myself every day. 

When my bf and I buckled down for serious quarantining in early March, I felt like it was going to be okay. And things were okay for a while, and then I felt the depression creeping in. The hopelessness, the disappointment, the futility, the total lack of motivation. I got bad grades doing school online and don’t think I’ll be going back in the fall. And now at this point it’s all just completely hit me that all of my goals and dreams are being pushed back indefinitely and I’m just fucked up. 

I alternate between not sleeping at all and sleeping too much, I can’t focus on anything when I try to set little goals for myself, I can’t paint anymore, I can’t enjoy movies or books or video games, I can barely even bring myself to properly care for my plants and I don’t feel the same joy when I do it anymore. I just feel like I can’t do anything. Like I am literally going to just rot away. 

My relationship with my bf is struggling, at least on my end. It’s hard to feel joy or love or anything good. I get manic at times, and goof around and laugh too much, but it’s empty. It’s just crazy manic energy coming out. I’m not actually feeling happy, I’m feeling upset. Sometimes I look at my bf and feel like I don’t even know him even though I know that’s not true. Everything just feels hollow. 

It’s all just getting too much for me and I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want my life back."
depression,"Lost And Looking For Understanding, Some Sense of Connection Good morning all,  


I'll be upfront, I don't even know if I should be doing this, if it's the right thing to do, but I feel so isolated and confused, I don't really know what else to do.  
So I'll rant a bit I guess, and see what happens.  
Probably a long post, my apologies, I know most people don't like reading too much.

Soon it will be 10 years of near-complete isolation.  
Lost what few friends I had December 2009, moved several states away, and had to deal with a couple years of serious self-neglect that almost killed me.  
I broke, I guess, really all that can be said.  
Since 2012, maybe late 2011, I've been in and out of therapy. A very small number of good therapists, and several really bad experiences, and I'm at a point where I'm seeing someone new and am entirely unconvinced they can help me understand how I can help myself, if that makes any sense.  
I've got two friends, and can only say I have contact with my parents.  
My sister, her husband, his mother, their kid, they all live in their own world. I almost never hear from them unless they need tech support, and my parents really don't have much connection to them either.  
She never liked me anyway, and I never could trust her or feel comfortable around her, she's never been a good person to me, outside of some very rare exceptions. Not trying to say she's a bad person, but she and I aren't on, well, terms at all, really.  
My parents, they care about me, but they just don't understand what I deal with. My dad just brushes off any time I try to talk about it with him, and my mom generally just defaults to some variant of ""man up"" or in the past, insinuating that I'm the reason why I've had such a hollow life.  
One friend, it's not really possible to talk about anything serious with him. He either makes light of it, makes fun of it, or is frankly just hateful towards me. I've had doubts for years if he's a good friend, or someone toxic I should distance myself from. It's really complicated with him, as it's all online and he deals with a fair few mental health issues, and my paranoia and whatnot make me think the worst of him. Discerning the truth is exceedingly difficult, in all areas of my life.  
My other friend, she's a therapist I used to have, but I can't say I really ever feel comfortable talking about any of this with her. She's a great person, but I guess I just don't have that same level of trust I had when I was seeing her as a therapist. I don't think it's personal, it's just therapists are legally bound to keep stuff private, and my mental stuff tends to make me paranoid and very closed off.  


I somehow managed to move out of my parents' house in 2013. I was and still am not really someone that should be living on their own, but the alternative was being psychologically abused by my parents. My dad's rule was so long as I lived with them, I had to go to church, twice Sunday, once Wednesday. No excuses, no real way to not go unless you were quite physically ill.  
At the time I was a closeted Atheist, and I could only really get to sleep late at night, averaging three hours per day. Of course wanting to sleep more was no reason to miss church, nor was my attempt to look after my well-being a reason to skip it.  
I guess I still have some resentment towards them because of that.

So I live on my own, and I really shouldn't.  
I constantly struggle with keeping my apartment clean, and at my previous place I was under constant threat of eviction, due in no small part to my troubles with cleanliness.  
I at least can pay bills, but really I have government income to thank for that. I don't work, and really couldn't at this point anyway. Sometimes a friend has a pet-sitting job for me. Barely get anything from EBT/food stamps either, so affording groceries tends to be a constant stress factor.  
Funnily enough, the COVID stuff has made me more financially stable than I really ever have been. Kind of feels messed up though, truth be told, millions unemployed and I'm over here, consistently poor and able to keep the lights on with no problem.   
My life confuses me at times.  


Usually I'm physically well. This year has been different.  
Most of which has been spent with no appetite and a severe decrease in food consumption.  
When I do eat, odds are good I won't taste anything anyway, or I have to deal with nausea, both too at times.  
Most I've managed for two months now is one small meal in the evenings, and a snack a few hours prior to bedtime.  
I don't know why, and two doctors so far have treated me poorly and given me no answers.  
One went so far as to say I should take it as a good thing, that I'll lose weight because of it.  
I've lost weight sure, probably around 70, maybe 80 in a seven month time span.  
But it hasn't been healthy, I just can't eat much.  
So I always feel physically weak.  
Just want I needed.  
On the positive, and maybe TMI, side of things, I haven't had to worry about the thrice daily bathroom visits in quite some time this year, so thank you constipation, I guess. Have had to deal with that for close to 20 years now. I'm 29 now. Yeah, dealt with that for two thirds of my life.   
Never got any answers as to why either, so I gave up and just accepted it.  


I guess I haven't spoken about the mental stuff much. Sorry, it's a bit after 7 am and I've yet to go to bed, so my mind is quite frazzled, well, a bit more than usual, at least.  
Best diagnosis I've got is major depressive disorder with anxiety.  
Some doctor that tested me for stuff said I had OCD, but the papers apparently didn't mention that, according to the current therapist. Confusing, but if the shoe fits.  
So I'll say I do, because who else in their right mind would check their speed every 30 seconds or so when driving.  
Then there's potential for high-functioning Autism. Only ever gotten one person to take that seriously, and the best they could do is say I probably have it based on their time with me.  
So again, shoe fits so I'll go with it.  


I don't really go out.  
I get groceries, I may visit parents once or twice a month, if I'm lucky, may go out to get a pizza to bring in.   
If I'm feeling daring, I'll even eat inside a place.  
Rarely there will be family get-together things, which I hate but go anyway. No one ever tries having or including me in conversation, and if I try, my sister or her husband, or his mother, talks over me.  
Not to mention the racism and bigotry my sister loves spewing... Meh.  
Of course none of that matters with this COVID thing going on, so I'm more isolated that usual, which frankly is funny to think about.  
Me, more isolated than usual.  
Weird.  


I don't want to go out either, truth be told, I don't want to socialize with people.  
I'm honestly quite resistant to even online socializing, so this whole post thing makes me exceedingly uneasy. But I'm in desperate need of an anchor, at least I think I am. I'm only getting worse at this point, and my being alone does everything to complicate that fact.   
As an aside, it's really, really difficult to figure out what's going on my head at any given moment. This posting thing seems like a good idea for now, but it could be a terrible idea. I really don't know.  


People scare me. Generally, I assume anyone and everyone is going to act terribly towards me.  
I've always been a weird person, even the weird kids in school thought I was weird.  
And now that I've had zero experiences people my age have had, I bet I'm even weirder now.  
Society doesn't like weird people.  
They made that clear in high school.  


Going to be honest, if I could rationalize suicide, I would just do that and be done with this.  
But I care too much, and really don't want to put my parents through that.  
Sounds kind of odd to me, caring, most of the time I feel very little. I still remember the night when that part of me broke.  
Was laying in bed with extreme anger and such, which I had dealt with daily for six months at that point, non-stop. Then all of a sudden something just broke and all of that just slipped away. Been nine years since then. Still no clue what that was, what happened.  
Been able to tell my parents I love them again though, after I guess four years at that time.  
I have the acquisition of my cats to thank for that. I'm not sure that's the right word, but I think it gets the point across. They at least helped me to feel love again, to a degree.   
That just sounds cliche and stupid, but whatever.  
I either feel extremes, or really not much at all.  
Most people have an emotional range of 1-10, me, it's more like 1-3, 1-4 if it's a good day.  


So that helps me in my lack of connecting with anyone new.  
I don't trust them and think ill of them, and even if I do kind of not hate them, I can't keep the emotions going long enough to really make a connection.  
Online friend is someone I can keep connected to though, it doesn't require much of me, and we only speak maybe 30 minutes max a day, spread out among however many hours he and I are awake at the same time.  
Sometimes we play games together. But most of the time, I can count on not talking to him much at all.  
I don't really play online games, and when I do, I don't talk to anyone, unless it's ""good game"" or whatever.

But I am willing to try to connect with someone, something, a community maybe.  
Like I said, being alone doesn't help, and I'm curious if maybe being in contact with people that potentially understand my struggles helps in some way.  


So, long story short: I'm testing the waters to see if maybe I can connect with someone, or a group of someones, who can understand what I'm dealing with on some level. Can't say I have much hope, but that's probably the paranoia and/or depression talking.  
If I'm in the wrong place, I'm sorry.  
If so, then if you could direct me to a more appropriate place, it would be appreciated.  
And again, apologies for the long post.  
It makes sense currently, posting all that info, my reasoning is that info may help others understand what I'm dealing with, so they can better determine if I'm worth their time responding in some way.  


If you've made it this far, thank you.  
That helps in some way to know that others know I exist, if that makes sense.  
I don't feel like I'm making much sense at all.  


Guess I should get some rest, maybe then my cat will stop staring at me.  
She's adorably obnoxious.  


PS: After proofreading, I feel like the whole thing comes off sarcastic, or non-serious. Sorry about that, everything said is a thing I deal with, I just sometimes have an odd way of phrasing what's going on in my head. I guess I'm dealing with some disassociation this morning, stuff doesn't feel particularly real, so my wording reflects that."

depression,"Are antidepressants a scam? Welp, I have gone to a neurologist for three times and took antidepressants for around 1.5 months and I can say that while meds do help with my sleep, my thoughts don't really go away. My neurologist gives a very low dose (1/2 the lowest doses of xanax and paroxetine --&gt; roughly 5mg of paroxetine and 0.125mg of xanax) and won't prescribe me medicines over the phone :/ He wants me to buy it at his clinic thing but he sells his drugs at a super high fking price.  


My question is simple: were antidepressants created with a purpose to scam depressed people like us? or do they actually help? or is my doctor trying to scam me?   


I have heard that many depressed people need to take them for life and I'm kinda scared. I would rather die then spend like 1/4th of my expected annual salary on depression meds. (im going to uni next year) I live in Vietnam currently and here mental illnesses are not considered to be of any importance compared to physical illnesses so it's hard for me to find a good neurologist and therapist dude."
depression,"Stop the bullshit You only matters when you are famous, whether you wanted it or not, and people care way more about what you say, whether it's for the good or the worst.

Like you know... Saw that article about Paris Jackson, her dad is dead when she was young, okay she is not the only one to have been trough that, I am pretty sure.

She mutilated and burned herself because a cousin told her she is fat. Many manyyyy people went trough that, way worst sometimes... I did too, and I didn't inflicted that to myself. 

Poor girl she is now a model, she is pretty and got plenty of money, must be hard. Ah yes my bad, it must be hard too to be famous, always stalked, talked about, mental illness that can result from all that, is crazy. 

Yep whatever... I know someone will come with on his high horse and big ass morality telling how I don't understand and all that. No competition ofc in unhappiness... But not everyone is treated the same as well"
depression,"Please read my vent. Maybe it will help me. I have been on medication for 6ish years now. So far it has worked.

Before the medication I would cry and scream everyday when I was alone. I would punch my ankles at night because I felt I deserved it. And most because cutting hurt to much and I didnt want people to know I was sad and I would feel like a burden if they helped me. 

Now I am doing better. Or I was doing better.

I have trouble brushing my teeth because it's too much effort. 
I had been laughing and randomly singing. My mom noticed and said I must be happier. I stopped because being happy sounded weird.

This might be tmi but I dont know how to put a hide box over it.
I think I might have pcos because my period has lasted more than 7 days and I change the pad every 2 hours. I feel gross and uncomfortable but feel that I deserve it.

I can only tell the dogs I love them because telling it to my family is awkward. 

I dont know what to so."
depression,"Is getting a pet a good idea to cope with depression? I'm a vet myself and I feel stupid af asking this, but I'd like to know what you guys think about it. I've thought about getting myself a guinea pig (I already own a dog and a cat) since I've read they need so much love and I'm ready to give it all to it instead of giving it to people who seem bothered by being shown love from me."
depression,"My feelings feel invalid and lockdown has made things worse. I have always struggled with these thoughts, ever since I was a child. In my childhood I was abused and told I didn't deserve to live, so I have ever since then wished to just not exist and struggled to accept myself. Don't get me wrong, my parents are really supportive now, they didn't know how to raise kids as young adults, but I feel that I won't ever be able to trust my parents or family completely, despite knowing how much they love me, because every time they would get angry, they would take it out on me. 

I'm really bubbly and cheerful, I love spending time outside with friends and it's really easy for me to meet and make new friends. Because of that every time I open up about my feelings, the ones really really deep down, I'm told I'm not depressed. This has happened between close friends/partners and even my own family. So much, that I don't even know if I struggle with it. But authorities in my college have continuously told me that I needed to get therapy?. Either the people around me don't believe me, or people in my life have just told me that they couldn't deal with my thoughts and I went too far by telling them how I feel. 

Do I just have the blues? Am I just temporarily sad? Are all the years I deliberated injuries to myself and planned the exit from my existence a joke? Just a phase? Just because I have the ability to be happy, and try my hardest to be happy, does that mean I can't hate, possibly ever hate myself so much I just want to stop every thought in my head? 

I feel like these thoughts bring out the worst in me, I always overthink, worry a lot. I feel that I can't be lovable because of these traits and one day the most important person in my life will see all these things, and realise my faults and be sick with sticking with me and just move on. And one day, they will see me how I see myself. I feel like a horrible person on days my thoughts are the only thing in my head.

And not being able to go out and see people makes things so much worse. I'm a university student abroad and COVID-19 has prevented me from going back home. I have been by myself for a few months (I was able to spend a bit of time at a close persons place, but I needed to go back since I had valuables and am moving soon) and it's been shit. I actually feel best when I'm around people and being deprived just leaves me to sit and think about all these thoughts I have of myself. In my home country things are finally easing down, every one of my friends is meeting up and here I am indulging myself in video games because that's the only way I am able to have human interaction and chill with people I know outside of going to the grocery store. I feel miserable and pathetic when I think about this. 

Maybe everyone is right and I'm just overdramatic or make problems where they shouldn't be. Maybe my feelings are not valid, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel like shit to constantly hate myself and to wish to stop existing. I love how family has told me I have no reason to, and they're right. I have loving parents, a partner and I study abroad and have lots of friends. I am able to be happy and cheerful and positive, and I don't know why I feel like everything around me is just crumbling. I don't know why I hate myself. I don't know why I just want to stop this. I could name a thousand reasons why life is worth living but I still feel miserable living it. 

Thanks for reading this far. I'm sorry."
depression,Mornings By far morning is worst part of my day! Doesn’t matter how long will I sleep I feel so empty inside my head.It is like 3 years now since I got this illness and seems to never end....I guess Im writing this post in hopes of someone sharing their success story of beating depression.Please tell me it is possible to win....
depression,"Happiness is the sum of happy moments I (49M) am clinically depressed, most likely since childhood. Now I want to share with you something that was a huge eye opener for me - just a few months ago.

I think many depressed people, maybe most, have a wrong conception of happiness. They have a black-and-white view on things and think: Either my life is unhappy or it’s happy. A happy life in this conception is one that is entirely happy. In many cases this conception was learnt since childhood, because the parents raised us with a toxic “Either you are successful in life, or you’re a failure” attitude.

Now an entirely happy life doesn’t exist, because everybody has sad moments. For healthy people, this is trivial, and they don’t have to think about it. For many depressed people, this is an insurmountable obstacle towards a more happy life.

So what’s a happy life? If you look back at your past, starting from the current moment, going back a certain amount of time, and the sum of happy moments during this period is more than the sum of sad moments, this period was a happy period. Most of you will say that for you this is never the case, and you may be right.

So start small. The shortest possible period in this context is a moment. If you have a happy moment, notice it. Observe it. Have your inner self tell yourself: This was a happy moment. This can be anything: your dog greeting you when you come home, the nice feeling of the sun on your face when you take a walk, the taste of a good and healthy meal. Store this moment in the special storage for happy moments. Try to have happy moments.

You can try to look back more, maybe the morning, looking back at it at lunch. Some day you’ll be brave enough to look back at the full day when you go to bed.

And so on, you get the picture.

But this leads me to the other issue: When you look back at a full day, and the sum of happy moments is smaller than the sum of unhappy moments, you didn’t fail. The next day, you can go back and start looking back smaller amounts of time again. You can always try again. See, a sad day is ok. The next one can be a happy one again. And if it’s not, no problem. Maybe the next.

I’ve seen many posts of people who presented their finally cleaned up room. This is great, it’s a great achievement for many of us. But this is exactly the black-and-white thinking: Either my room is a total mess, or I manage to clean it perfectly. Instead, pick up one sock, put it into the bin. Notice the moment and feel good about it. Go from there.

I’m not there yet. It’s pretty much a theory, but I try to live by it, and it seems to be a good thing.

Sorry if this comes across a bit patronising, but I just wanted to share this. If it helps just one person, it was worth it."
depression,"Severely tired 😓 I wear my scars like it’s nothing,
Hide my tears so no one can see. 
I walk like I own my life,
Yet I still feel like I’m loosing control. 
I act and talk like nothing is bothering me,
But it’s as clear as daylight. 
The weight of my emotions are a weighing me down. 
Those thoughts of wanting to disappear,
1 pill, 2 pills, 3 pills. Maybe even more. 
Or do I let my blood run so I can feel my life slip away. It’s almost as though the light has dimmed more and more as the years past, as I get older. 
I’m tired, and I don’t think I can keep up with appearances anymore. 
I’m tired, and I don’t want to live anymore. 
I’m tired and I just want to go to sleep for eternity!"
depression,What helps with your feelings of being sad I feel like I am trapped underwater and I can’t break the surface. The bad feelings make me feel like I’m drowning and I feel physical reactions to it. It is getting bad. I just broke down not that long ago when I shouldn’t feel so negatively. Today was a good day. A lot of it stems from the inability to talk about these feelings in real life or escape from the things that trigger them (such as self loathing). I just pretend to be happy/okay and most people around me feel like I’m a hundred percent okay when I’m around them. I’ve had people tell me that they wished that they could be as happy and positive as I am. I’m afraid if I talk about how I’m actually feeling that they will abandon me and I will be alone. It’s happened before. I don’t think anyone wants to be around a sad person. My mind is not my friend. What are some of the things that have worked for you when you start feeling the negative taking over?
depression,"Hi... So I joined / found this page a couple days after attempting to take my own life. I just didn't want to be on this planet anymore. I swam out into Venice Beach after downing two bottles of Tequila to the dome. I just kept swimming and next thing i knew, i was coughing up water and tequila. I'm not religious so i don't believe i was brought back by a higher power but when i came to all i could remember is how amazing the sky looked. I just laid there until i sobered up and drove myself home and walked past my two roommates like nothing happened. I just wanna thank everybody in this thread for being alive. All of your post's help me realize that i'm not the only one living with demons. I don't know when i'll get better but i'm just taking it day by day and just wanted to show my appreciation for this thread."

depression,"life hates me I just feel alone throughout the years of school and social life I’ve been hit with people hate me, thoughts of self hate.i never made a single true friend in my life and the ones who I thought were my friends betrayed me.i got into a verbally abusive relationship where my she would constantly tell me all my faults and I tried doing my best and now I just feel broken. Life has a funny way of telling me I’m doing a good job by burning my hand, getting me severely sick and depressed. I thought about life and thinking I was ever gone would any body be at my funeral. I don’t think my own family likes me and I feel separated from everyone even at my own birthday. I stoped celebrating it because what’s there to celebrate another year of loneliness and self hate. I thought I had friend and I even asked when we graduate would they still text me but why would I ever think that when I was never even invited to any party. My loneliness and depression hit hard in senior year not because of the Coronavirus just because of myself and my idiot brain. I wish I could be happy but I know that would never happened because me thinking of being happy is just pushing that reality further and further away. I just wish throughout my school years I made at least one true friend but I guess that’ll never happened so what’s the point anymore. I don’t care about having a soulmate or anything like that anymore I just want one friend that I can talk to. The way I deal with my depression is just by pushing all of my emotions deep down and deal with them when they come back."
depression,"I’m low again and I’m scared There are times when my depression is really low, like the past few days.

I think it’s because I’m tired. I’m really tired. Yet sleep won’t fix it. 
I keep going back and forth on the consequences of leaving everything behind. Would it impact if I was gone? People would grieve, but move on eventually. 
I have a hard time finding joy. 
Usually during these times, I just sit in the shower and cry, or I wait till everyone in my house is asleep, and cry as silently as I can. Then usually by the next week or two, I can pull myself out.
I’m scared, because it has been harder and harder to pull myself out of this. My arms feel weak from pulling.
I am honestly scared. What if one day, I can’t pull myself out of it. Then what happens?"
depression,"My cat suddenly died Last night, my 15-year-old cat collapsed and died. I tried to resuscitate her, but I couldn’t save her. I should’ve been able to do more to help her. ￼She was all I had in my life, and ￼now she’s gone, and I don’t know what to do. I’m devastated. ￼"
depression,"I feel miserable and it's my own fault that I feel this way. Everyday is the same, a pointless monotony where I escape my problems through addictions and pointless entretainmet.

Exercise, meditation, healthy eating, social gatherings, getting enough sleep. But I don't even bring myself to even move a finger to change my habits and be better. Honestly I'm a waste of space. I'm moronic, why would I choose to remain mentally ill? Am I really so lazy that I'm willing to sacrifice my own health? I'm conscious that I should be doing something about it but I don't. I am a disgusting human being, I just feel repulsed at myself while writing this, victimizing myself on the internet in order to read comforting words. I'm just an attention seeker who is too weak to make the right choices. I always say to myself ""tomorrow will be different"" but it never is. I feel so tired all the time, it feels as if I'm loosing my will to live. Why aren't I more grateful about being alive? I should wake up everyday thanking the universe that I get to live and experience this body. I'm ungrateful, weak, pathetic, and it just feel like life is wasted on me, because I can't cope, I can't be healthy, I can't appreciate the gift of life as it should be. Hopefully, tomorrow I'll wake up and do something about my life instead of whining about it... But I usually know how that goes... Everyday is the same."

depression,"New poster, dealing with PTSD, social anxiety and night terrors. Help!!! 

25/F: College Honors student I am currently on citalopram (25 mg) very night, and (30 mg) of ambien before bed for sleep. 
During the morning and (20Mg) after lunch. Been on all of these for about 2 months

My depression has not improved much, my social life has an they have been keeping my together and pushing me with school, but my overall mood is very bare, blank, rude at times and nonchalant  and that’s not usually me, I’ve become super irritable and I don’t know if it is the citalopram or what, ambien usually knocked me out (unless recently) and my adderall work great for school and work. I hate laying in bed, numb, null, wasting hours of my day for no reasons. Getting up at 4pm is not ok, especially when I get in bed comfortably at 9/9:30

Any suggestions on an anti-depression meds? I’ve been on Wellbutrin and am off it after I made a life attempt."
depression,"I'm not sure what I can do... My friend came to me before the lockdown started about her mental health. She was really struggling after a break up and I took her to the doctor's where she got antidepressants and then to a drop in counselling session. The plan was to support her through all of this but then we went into lockdown and it was no longer possible. I later found out that she had stopped taking her tablets (but she is now on new ones that her mum is giving her every day) because they weren't working and then she lost her job and things got worse. She stopped talking to people and she has been afraid to leave her house because of the virus.

She started talking to me again but only a little bit and then one day she tried to call me but I wasn't doing well in that moment so I didn't answer and I tried to call her back about an hour later but she didn't answer and she hasn't spoken to me since (she did message me a day or two later but she removed the messange so I don't know what she said) and I feel like by not being available in that moment I have unintentionally made things worse 😣

Her mum has messaged me this morning asking me if I will come and see her as things have gotten worse. She's not eating, she's been self harming and she won't talk to anyone. Her mum has said she's going to ask her about me coming to see her and she'll let me know later... I really don't know what to do. I'm also anxious about going to her house in general because you're not allowed to visit people during this time. I don't know what I'd even say to her as I'm not good at talking or dealing with emotions... I don't want her to get any worse 😭"

Not even sleep is a relief because I can never get comfortable, and when I'm ""high"" I actually get bored of sleep while sleeping.

I just wish I can get this over with and start focusing on better things, like building my business, charity, having fun, etc. All of this seems impossible when I'm super depressed or battling what seems to be a mixed mania hell."

depression,"I learned a lot about my ex of 2 years today, more than I should've known and it's killing me. A while back, my ex girlfriend that dated me for two years started dating my best friend. This resulted in me completely cutting them both off. I recently reconnected with him and today we finally hung out and he told me what they did, after they ask.

Hearing that she started saying she loved him before they were even official killed me. Hearing that she begged him for sex even though she never did with me killed me. Hearing that she threatened suicide when he wanted to end it killed me. Hearing that she tried to go to his house multiple times when they dated killed me.

Loving someone for two years and learning these things has hurt me so much. I want to be over her completely, but I'm so hurt by this information. What the fuck is so wrong with me?

depression,"A Play About Depression So, my school is doing a mental health week where each day we have a different illness. At the end of the day, there will be a performance to inform people about what the illness is and ways we can help those who suffer from them. I chose to work on depression. We are doing a play about a young boy who suffers it after the death of his mom. I myself have depression, nut no one in the school knows it. I told the music teacher who is directing the play that I am really good at acting so I wanted to try the role to put myself in another's shoes. I wanted to do this mainly as a way of literally coming out about it without actually having to deal with it. It's just I have never had a real way to vent so I feel like this could help. I can't help but feel like I'm cheating it though. It's like I get to show this side of me and let it out without people knowing. I guess I just feel like anyone who sees me and has depression would probably think it's easy for an actor to do it cause they don't have to take it home with them. But I do."

depression,"Do you experience drastic ups and downs? Everyday, my depression is like a rollercoaster. I’ll be fine and functional for a few hours then hit rock bottom (like “I’m gonna end it right now” rock bottom) from the most random triggers. And it’s like throughout the whole day and it’s been like that for at least this whole year, if not longer. The pandemic and quarantining didn’t help of course but even when things were “normal,” I was experiencing it.

I know you are probably thinking because it feeds into my depressed mindset, but literally if it was hot and sunny out I would actually want to die if i went outside. Like it just makes me feel extremely uncomfortable and out of place and gross I don’t know how to explain it. Being in the rain and in nature is one of the only things that is on the verge of making me feel more normal during my depressive episodes (which come and go every 3-6 months for about 3 months). It almost feels like when i’m walking outside in nature, i’m like on the verge of feeling normal and feeling like i have a purpose. It almost is like that feeling when you have to sneeze, but you just can’t. It’s very frustrating, but it makes me feel a little more hopeful than when i’m inside or when it’s bright and hot out.

depression,"I don't know what to do anymore I used to have a variety of dream spirits, even though I suck but I still do my best in everything.  

But as time passed by, my little fantasy world started to fall apart....... ever since my parents keep and won't stop humiliating me in front of my cousins and friends. They seem so proud every time talking about all my weakness and how idiot is I to everyone they like. I still remember that time I did a small mistake and accidentally upset my aunt, so she scolded me so loud in front of my parents. I got scared and embarrassing, so I cried ... the hot tears falling down from my eye to cheek, my head was looking down. My parents didn't say anything, but throw me a shit looking like I mean nothing to them no matter what I do. Everything is my fault, whatever is it they just don't care, just me, I'm the causes of all the shit things.

Every time I tried to forgive them, because well every parent is shit, no one is perfect. But deep inside me was hurt so much. I didn't get any benefit in forgiving them, but if I don't, my life couldn't move on. But the point is, why is it so unfair. Who's gonna heal me? NO ONE!

Every time I get into shit problems, I just keep quiet and share with no one. Because no one will understand, they tell me to think positively, try some new hobby........ I TRIED EVERYTHING! IT'S ALREADY NOT the FIRST TIME! It's LIKE INFINITE! MY HEART HAD BROKEN INTO INFINITE BROKEN PIECES!

I forgive and forgive again, but shit still comes and comes again.

I feel like I'm drowning into a very deep ocean. Sometimes I found peace within, sometimes I feel extremely suffocating. There were only empty, loneliness, fear, and darkness. I'm lost. 

Eventually, I made my own thinking: ' There are many victims from disaster, some survive some dead. If I get to choose, what would I be, a survivor of disaster or a survivor of this pathetic world so I can escape from my darkness and turn into dust '"

depression,"hi everyone. been a long time lurker dealing with depression and ptsd and i've been in a weird head space since last august and i'll explain. just need to talk to someone/anyone about it since i haven't pushed myself to get therapy.

august of 2019 i went to hawaii for a 4 day trip with 2 of my best friends. the second day were were there was when a lot of shit happened. we were body surfing at one of their beaches for a good hour and a half straight. after getting slammed we took a 15-20 min breather then decided to go back in the water. the waves were a lot dangerous and intense by the second time we went in. i am not a strong swimmer at all but my friends were so they were further out than me. after only 10 mins or so i was already pulled out far enough from shore to try and make an attempt to swim or walk back. the water height was at my chin and that's when i started to panic. i jumped and yelled for one of my friends and by the time i started to go back down, a 8 ft wave hit me and i was under for what felt like an eternity. it was realistically only a good 6 or 8 seconds of fighting to get oxygen into my body but everytime i thought i was above the surface, i was just inhaling a stupid amount of ocean water. by the time my friends got to me, i was already out.

if you wanna know what it's like, it's like your asleep but not dreaming. i felt myself give up and allowed myself to let go. it was just black. didn't feel a thing. then 19 hours later i woke up.

when i got to shore, there's was 2 lifeguards that started to do CPR on me. i didn't have a pulse for a good 5 minutes until the paramedics came and defibrillated me. they rushed me to the ICU where i had a breathing tube inserted for 14 hours then i eventually woke up.

drowning, solid 1/10 experience. don't recommend it a whole lot. also got sunburnt and that wasn't very nice either.

i don't know how to process everything that happened. i still don't after all of these months that has passed. i've had terrible nightmares, daily flashbacks, and i've just felt stuck more than anything. just wanted to say thank every single one of you for being here and thank you for letting me vent. i'm doing okay, it's just one day at a time. it'll get worse before it gets better."
depression,"I'm not going to do it I wouldn't hurt myself. 

There are at least a dozen people that I would hurt deeply if I hurt myself. A hard life is common, especially after suffering mental illness or a developmental disorder like I have. 

It's okay to suffer. It's normal. I have lots of people to help me prevent becoming homeless, even if it means becoming another drag on the system and claiming disability because of physical pain and an inability to get a job. 

I think I'll be okay and I don't think I'll kill myself because I'm afraid of how much pain it would put me in. I appreciate this subreddit for how it reminds me that I'm not the only one in pain, I'm not the only one that's made mistakes, I'm not the only one struggling. 

I don't want people to suffer. Just because you're human and you can read this, I want you to know that your pain is NORMAL, your pain is a VALID REASON TO COMPLAIN, and I want you to know that WE CARE AS A SPECIES, not just as assholes who have to take care of ourselves. 

I had a lot of money. I helped people I shouldn't have before myself, I struggle to help myself, and I'm having a hard time knowing that I'm going to be okay. 

I lost my parents. I have a developmental disorder that prevents me from feeling normally. I have made mistakes that I regret deeply but that's no reason for my life to end. I can still use my intellect to help people, I can still get a job. 

I miss feeling hopeful, but life is a never-ending struggle. As Thoreau put it  ""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" and that's okay, we didn't choose to be here.

We're here mostly for others, as we live a communal life, and not hurting ourselves, sharing our hurt, and relying on others at the times we struggle the greatest is a normal part of it. 

Even those of us with no ability to support ourselves deserve a life of comfortable complacency, as long as it it possible, and as long as it is possible, life is not made for suffering, it it made for the equilibrium between suffering and joy."

I guess lately it's been harder and harder feel happy, i work hard and do things that i know despite not feeling happy now, I'll feel happy at a later date when my brain is nicer to me. But it's kind of flat lined for while, I'm not really feeling happy anytime, it's really frustrating. Without those little glimpses of feeling pride or happiness or a sense of achievement I feel like i'm just sinking deeper. Little apathetic about it too, like, well I guess this is the new norm.

Objectively I have a fantastic life, I'm achieving my dreams, working hard and all that, just not getting that mental reward for doing well i guess.

I kind of don't care either, I've developed a bit of a distrust of psychs. So many have little to no idea how to help me or are so obviously just in it for the money. I don't have the energy or funds required to be a tourist and find another psych. My work is super high risk and trailing drugs that may have serious side effects is basically playing russian roulette with my life and others, which I won't do.

I don't have friends or anything, I have a wife i love but other than her my life is strictly a professional one.  I don't even know if i really want friends, like I do because I'm lonely but I'm just not fun to be around or anything, I get bored of people easily and I'm heavily focused on my work.

I would really like some help/advice. Apologies for the length of the post in advance. 

I am a male (32) and am going through a very tough time mentally, as I can imagine many on this forum are. I have, through the years, become very hard on myself. I rarely celebrate achievements and constantly talk negatively to myself. I was clinically depressed from about 2009 to 2013, when I was doing my BSc in physics. The last year was horrible but there was a sense of relief when it was over. I then did an MSc from 2013-2015 which I, with some problems, managed to get through and met a lot of great people. I would say my depression was not very present during these years, but I was still very critical of myself. I then rolled into a PhD without thinking about it too much. The first few years I was doing ok mentally, ups and downs but nothing serious. However, the last 6 months of the program was horrible for me. I was constantly anxious about failing, about not being good enough, about the worst outcomes which could arise. These outcomes, obviously, did not occur. I was diagnosed with GAD and tried therapy to alleviate symptoms. Meanwhile I thought I would get some experience in another position, as my goal or dream had always been to get a training position in a hospital. While working and waiting for interviews my anxiety gradually got worse and questioned if I would get a position, in an OCD manner. Everyday questioning myself and what I am doing. Eventually I got a position and I thought all my problems would go away. However, 2 months into the position I broke down. I was crying and having panic attacks daily. It all seemed too much, the new information, any task... it was all just too much. Its not even that the hours were bad, it was just that anything seemed too overwhelming. I was suicidal and then re-diagnosed with depression. I was put on SSRIs and sleeping pills. I reported in sick for 6 weeks. During the 6 weeks I did improve. When I was gardening or doing DIY tasks I felt actually quite good and kept thinking I would be happier if I could do something simple like this, that I know I can handle. I was still burdered by the worried over whether I was my ruining career or whether the job was for me. 

I began to go back to work, little by little. But am sometimes still feeling as if I am not good enough or overwhelmed by things. After a call/meeting I go outside and just sit, exhausted. I often have an urge just to try apply for something else, but that might not be the best timing. As everything seems like it is not reality right now and I need to perhaps get better before doing this? The problem is I then think I need to move now, because if I dont get better and lose this job, who will hire me? 

I am just not sure how to go forward. I catastrophize everything and the problem is all I concentrate on in life. Joy or fun does not enter the picture. I hate it."
depression,"(20M) Never had a girlfriend or been in a relationship and it's been screwing up my moral really bad these past months The title says it all. I never had a girlfriend or been in a relationship in 20 years. I even never kissed a girl before the end of 2019. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

Not to be narcissistic but I look pretty good, far above average imo and several people told me that before. I have a lot of friends, I'm someone really sociable, very smart, funny guy and a lot of things to say. Social skills have never been an issue but I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me when it comes to intimate relationships. I just hate meeting someone with the only purpose to hook up, I like when it's natural, without any ideas at the beginning. But even then I'm not able to fckin make something out of it.

I gained a lot of confidence when I went to America for half a year in 2019. I realized that I could have pretty much success with girl but yeah, now I'm back in my country and I feel like things don't move. I'm not even able to get a date with someone. There was that super duper hot chick from my high-school who liked 3 of my ig pics. I texted her, asking her if she'd like to go out with me once the quarantine is over and she was really eager about it and told me yes. She's been liking all my tweets and sending me pics for the past weeks. But every time I asked her for a date she's always been busy. Now she doesn't send me any pics anymore since 3 weeks, doesn't text me or whatever. I just don't understand what the fuck I did wrong. I feel like I've been acting super naturally, talking to her one day from another, but as usually nothing happened and I guess my chances are close to 0 (she left me on read) and I didn't even spam her or text her everyday or whatever. 

Back to life where not a single girl is interested in me (well there have been several girls interested in me in the past but I had a lack of self confidence back then and as always, didn't know how to act).

There is only one girl with who I've felt really fine. Like really. And she sees me as someone really special too. It's that girl I met when I was abroad. I met her by luck at an event back then, and we kept contact as well as with her group of friends. I felt so good when I was with her, she was the best side of me. We always had super interesting topics and we event went to a huge festival together. Like I honestly never felt that before with a girl, everything was just so natural and fluid. I saw her pretty much every week end, and we made such an amazing duo. 

But now I'm back in my country and I'm a loser again. I know that I count a lot for her but we didn't hook up for several reasons (me leaving soon, she still had feelings for her ex, etc...). She's dating another guy now, and it makes me feel even worse and I'm getting a bit angry. I'm just such a loser. Of course getting in a relationship isn't a problem for such a beautiful girl. I just hope that I'll have my change again when I'll be back the her place next year.

I don't know what the fuck is wrong is me. Why can't I just have luck with girl? I feel really alone sometimes. I see a lot of my friends all the time, but when I'm back at my apartment I always feel really lonely and wish I had a gf to speak to, cook something or just have fun with or whatever. I have so much love and care to give rn, it's killing me from the inside."
depression,"My Abuser is Still Finding Ways to Get To Me I just don’t want to even get up tomorrow. I’m running from my birth mother who is extremely a shove and manipulative, she also has problems with chronic lying (she lies about having cancer, being best friends with the victims of the Pulse massacre, etc) she keeps having friends of hers contact me to threaten me, harass me and tell me to just give up on life. Today was another one of her goonies telling me “I would have given you up too”. My heart hurts so bad. I want to crawl in bed and never wake up again."
depression,Failing I've never gotten diagnosed with anything cause I never told any adults about my symptoms and I know self diagnosing is frowned upon but I'm 100% positive I have/had some form of depression. Since I've never said anything I can't prove that I'm not about to flunk this year due to laziness. I never stayed back before but even though I'm feeling better there's no time to fix my grades enough to go on to senior year with my friends. I'm not sure how I feel about that
depression,"Wondering what’s the point.. Hi, I’m (20M) have been in a long battle with mental health since I was young, I managed to climb out the pit of depression for a while but recently have been in and out of deep depression and anxiety. I don’t see the point in anything anymore and yet I try and still get disappointed or hurt. I feel that I’m too soft and I should toughen up but inside it just creates more chaos. Don’t think I’m being taken seriously and am a joke. Thoughts of suicide are coming more but I know it’s something I will never act on. Just the thought of ending it all is peaceful yet thinking about it is painful. I left my job yesterday, I’m never satisfied with my jobs. I’ve worked 2 warehouse jobs and just left a construction job. My girlfriend doesn’t seem interested in me and I have trouble expressing raw emotion as I don’t know if she actually cares and I don’t want to be so vulnerable (further makes me feel like a pussy). I want to see healthcare professionals but don’t know how. I don’t even know if anyone will read this so ig imma just vent. If anyone does read this could you let me know, help a lonely guy out.

And if you don’t then have a good one. Hope your day goes better than mine."
depression,"how do i tell my friends? i need to talk to someone, and i don’t have my next doctors appointment for a few weeks. i wanna talk to my friends about what’s going on but i really don’t want to burden them or make them feel awkward or anything. how do i talk to them."
depression,"I dragged my boyfriend back down from the roof last night. Then I realised I was the one putting him there in the first place. I have had two depressive episodes that each lasted for around a year... though not being on antidepressants at the moment, I have always been having suicidal thoughts on and off, especially when life gets rough and I get really stressed out and overwhelmed.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, never experienced this level of darkness his entire life.  

Last night, we were both exhausted after work, and argued over something not so important (of course it felt very important then).  We argued, we talked, and I felt very overwhelmed and upset that I had a small breakdown - curling up into a ball and cried/hyperventilated/shivered for idk how long.  

He left the room to supposedly go shower.  I heard the metal gate of our apartment, then the gate to the rooftop (we live on the top floor of the apartment building). 

I was still recovering from my breakdown/panic attack/something, but I crawled up and went out to check - nobody was in the apartment. It was dark. 

I felt this panic inside me, so I grabbed the keys and went up to the roof - he was there. 

His phone and his keys were on the floor.  He was standing there leaning towards the fence.  He didn’t hear me until I got closer.  He asked what was I doing there.  I asked him back.  He said he was thinking.  I knew that look. and that “reason”.  

Then I basically dragged him back into the staircase, down to our floor, into our room.  I started brushing my teeth, and placed a toothbrush with toothpaste into his hands.  He started to sob.  I washed the toothbrush for him, put him in bed, and handed him a glass of water. 

He struggled to talk.  After some time, he eventually told me why he was on the roof.  He kept apologizing for it, saying it was stupid and selfish.  I told him it wasn’t stupid, it wasn’t selfish, it was nothing to be ashamed of.  He was very much in shock about how he had these thoughts at all.  He’s never ever had these ideas ever in his life.   We talked a little bit about how I used to deal with these thoughts, and some other stuff I can’t really remember clearly. 

We eventually went to sleep. 

This morning when I woke up, all I could think of was how I exposed him to this level of darkness that he’s never encountered before.  I cannot face the fact that, as much as he thanks me for bringing him back down from the roof, I was the one who put him there in the first place. I was just making up in the slightest possible way for what I’ve done.  I brought this darkness into his life.  Then I put Imagine Dragon’s “Demons” on repeat.  


“Don’t get too close, it’s dark inside. 

I wanna hide the truth

I wanna shelter you 

Don’t wanna let you down 

But I am hell bound 

Your eyes they shine so bright

I wanna save that light

I can’t escape this now

Unless you show me how.”


What the fuck have I done?  I just ruined a good life by my own unredeemable darkness.  I brought him the curse of this dark turmoil."
depression,"Screw Facebook Memories I opened facebook and the first thing I see is a picture of my beautiful baby girl. Nightmare, an American shorthair cat. She was months old in that picture.

In the following year, I lost her and my other baby (who was 10 years old), as my life got complicated.

Probably the most depressing moment of my life, when I realized they were gone. And here I am again.

fml. Screw you facebook memories."
depression,"Info on me Hi, my name's felix and i'm a bisexual, non binary transgender man(he/they/him) and i'm also on the autism spectrum and i'm soon 25 y/o. And my reason for joining is to get any help i can. Been also abused emotionally and physically by both parents and have... very...complicated relatives.... that i guess can be considered toxic(mostly for their ideologies and so on) Hello, this is my story. Nice to meet everyone."
depression,"Not hopeful for the future. For context: I’m a millennial who was already struggling with anxiety, depression, and ADHD before the pandemic hit. I graduated with a masters degree in public health in Jan 2019 with mountains of debt, and ironically have never been able to find a job, and when I did get a job offer it was never over $18 an hour...I’ve tried and tried and tried again but I still manage to always came up short. I soon realized that the American dream is dead. It died with my parents generation. So yeah, that sucks already. 

So now, We’re in the midst of an uncontrolled pandemic that’s killed over 112,000 Americans in 3 months so far, racial protests, toxic politics, and an economic recession that is bound to become a depression in no time. States and counties are opening up despite public health warnings and predictions that ANOTHER 100,000 could die from coronavirus before September. 

So, I mean what the fuck do we all have to look forward to? Really. All the mental health experts say is your generic, “limit your news intake”, “create a routine/schedule!” or, “remind yourself that this pandemic is only temporary”. With all due respect, I find all that advice useless. How am I supposed to remain optimistic of my future when nearly every local organization is being defunded (meaning less hiring for cities &amp; counties), but somehow wallstreets numbers are somehow doing great...go figure. 

Not to be bleak, but shit is looking pretty hopeless at this point, especially for millennials who’ve already inherited a trash economy with stagnant wages, no personal wealth, and lots of student loan debt with no way of paying it back. But who knows, maybe I’m just overreacting? I’m wondering what others think about this situation. What are your honest feelings about this batshit crazy year we’ve been experiencing. And what are you hopeful for, if anything. 

Thank you for listening. I just needed to rant. the past 2 weeks have been absolute torture. Im sure I’m not alone in feeling this way. It sucks but we’re all suffering together. 

Cheers."
depression,I self harmed after a year of being clean I can't sleep and I can't stop crying.
depression,"I am at an all time low Never been this depressed.

I literally keep trying to be happy but noo i just can't.

I have been like this for my whole life and i have no idea what to do."
depression,"My entire life I've been depressed my entire life... My childhood was terrible. Im in trauma therapy right now but I'm just so tired. 22 years. I'm so tired of feeling nothing. Of feeling numb. It doesn't ever stop. Meds don't work, 9 years of therapy hasn't helped either, and every time I think im gonna be okay I just hit the bottom even deeper. I'm so tired."
depression,"i don’t even know what to title this, everything just sucks i struggled with mental health a lot throughout my early teen years and when i turned 18 i kinda just got this wake up call to start making changes and turn my life around. i had a really bad alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine problem (marijuana being the worst) and i took the initiative to get therapy and go sober. i’m currently 5 months sober and man, everything was looking up. i started doing the hobbies i loved to do like skateboarding and playing the bass, spent less time playing video games, and even performed better in school and i was actually motivated

i don’t know what happened or when i started even getting this feelings but everything is just shit again. in this 5 months i burned a lot of bridges, some being my fault and some being unintentional, and i look at myself today and i just see a pathetic loser. i have no friends, the only person i pretty much have in my life is my girlfriend, and i know that’s not going to last forever so i don’t know what’s going to happen after. i have no one to confide my feelings too and all the confidence i had while i was doing drugs and even after i went sober is just completely gone. i look on social media and i see all of the people i used to love and care about do fun things together (despite the global quarantine) and i just feel so left out and alone. they just forgot about me i guess and i’m too scared to take the initiative to ask them to hang out. for all i know, they probably don’t want to hang out with me. i’ve always been there least favorite. yea they were a horrible influence on me but idk i just miss having friends i guess.

i’ve been depressed many times throughout my life and i know the feeling, and it’s actually coming back. i’m being more reclusive, i’m losing motivation, i’m losing weight and not eating (i’m extremely underweight and while i wasn’t depressed i weighed about 110) and i’m just sitting in front of a screen all day. i thought going sober and taking drugs out of my life was going to fix everything but i guess i was wrong. i just don’t know what to do. i miss having friends to talk to, i miss having a group i could feel apart of. as much as i’m glad i went sober, i miss the days where i wasn’t since atleast then i had a network of people that i cared about and that cared about me. who knows if they still even think about me, they probably don’t even care about me

this is getting quite long, sorry for the rant it’s 4:30 am and i need to sleep."
depression,"A phantom A mere spirit 

Caught between this world and the next
 
Not quite belonging
 
Not entirely lost

At least not yet 

But who knows what the future creates?

If it’s anything like before 

Just let it pass me by 

To just be, me, no one else 

No love. No hugs,

No tearful graduation day
 
No “ I’m so proud of you!”

My love, my daughter, the one I created

To be held dear and appreciated 

Just a hollow tomb of gray

Constant delay 

No one can truly understand 

When you’re proud and you’ve come a long way 

Small accomplishments 

No accompaniments

Just you, all the way 

You find someone 

Time passes 

They go away 

And each day is a world of gray

You can’t relate to anyone 

It’s far far too late"

depression,Always feeling upset for no reason Something I feel being upset is better then being happy.
depression,"It's back again. I just graduated high school, yesterday, and I thought the worst would be behind me. I've been depressed, anxious, suicidal, getting panic attacks for years.

I only tell my closest friends, I don't have that sort of open relationship with my parents.

I don't think I'm a good person, I don't know that I deserve this life, but I have it, and I'm gonna try my best to be better, to do good.

I've been crying for hours, maybe all I need is attention, approval from my peers, to be seen, to be loved, to be thought of as attractive, likable.

I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing, but I can't carry on like this."
depression,"I don't know what to do anymore It's been years of bottling everything up and repressing all of my negative emotions only for them all to spill out in the car ride before school. In retrospect, I've never been good at being vulnerable and opening up to anyone but It had reached a tipping point and I was so fucking desperate to tell someone that I have been feeling nothing for years. My mum didn't really know what to say but she said that I was going to have to talk to my dad about it and possibly see a therapist. It's been two weeks and we haven't spoken about it since that day. I also have not talked to my dad because he believes that there is always an underlying cause for mental health disorders. Basically, my mental state has depleted rapidly since isolation and I just can't find hope in anything. I don't want to wake up, eat, drink, go to the bathroom- I just don't wan't to do anything anymore. It pains me to write this but the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want my mum to feel like she should have told someone about me after that car ride."
depression,"Looks like my struggle was all for nothing I've tried meds, therapy, exercise, literally every kind of treatment for depression over the last decade and at the end of it all I'm actually sadder and lonelier than when I first started trying to recover. What the fuck is even the point if this is just how I'm supposed to be???

I wish I was dead but obviously I'm too big of a coward to make that happen which is even more pathetic. God I hate myself on every single possible level."
depression,Does depression need an actual reason? when i open up to people they always ask me why. honestly i dont know the reason too
depression,"why is everything so fucking hard now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares

no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves' you from your mental illness, but they're thinking of a glamourised, coming of age mental illness

no one wants to deal with the reality - not getting out of bed for 3 days straight and then finally getting up and not showering or brushing your teeth because you don't have the energy to. deleting your social medias and ignoring texts for days on end because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania 

everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"
depression,"Always suffering I know this will sound creepy/lame. But I wish I had it in me to go on a long nofap streak again . Because it probably helps by 30%. Even if its placebo. I just cant get myself to be successful anymore. Because throughout the day I do nothing. 

Been in quarantine 10 months. I cant bring myself to do anything. I feel like I have 100 lb dumbells on both shoulders so no matter what I do it's difficult. I wish I was asexual . I'm jealous of asexual people. Tired of all these urges I get I cant ever focus"
depression,I truly believe that I’m not real anymore I feel like I’m in a coma or in a dream and like nothing I do or say matters. Like I feel like I’m in a constant dream like state. Everything feels so fake yk. I don’t know if that makes sense but Yh
depression,"I want to care again I wouldn’t say I’m a depressed individual, I usually keep pretty upbeat, but recently, I’ve found myself stuck in a rut. I really just can’t make myself care about anything, I’m just content with doing nothing. I’ve fallen out of shape, I can’t make myself get out of bed, and I really don’t talk to anyone anymore. I’d just like to know if there’s anything I should be trying to do to stay engaged in life, I feel like I’m just drifting and there’s not really anything to look forward to. I want to want something again, and I’m not sure how to go about doing that. Everything that used to keep me going has just faded away. I’m not unhappy, I’m just not happy either."
depression,"Having a hard time. Not knowing how to cope. I have had bouts of depression since high school. I brushed it off, thinking just I can't cope well.

In high school, I was bullied. I begged my mom to transfer schools. That didn't happen. Meanwhile, my sister got transferred to one of the best private high schools in the country (no scholarship).

I got some luck though. I went to the best unis in my country. I had trouble adjusting though. Coming from a small town, I had to speak a different language and deal with people on the top echelons of society. I was mocked for being ""provincial"" in the beginning.

Same goes for law school. My peers had cars, luxury shoes and bags. I was the ""poor looking, provincial girl."" 

Years down the line, I got a stable job for the government. Work was suspended for three months due to the pandemic.

I am struggling to eat get some good sleep. Our bosses, with no considerations, are asking for our outputs now.

I have no car. Public transportations are suspended. The documents are in the office and I can't get them. The cases of Covid-19 is skyrocketing in my country.

My bosses don't seem to care.

I'm still struggling to cope. I can't quit because how else can I pay the bills? I just want for all these to end. Sometimes, I think that if I just kill myself, things will be better.

Sorry for the long post"
depression,"I can’t do anything, it’s as if I’m paralysed in bed Hell, I might as well be. I can’t even leave my bed. I don’t want to do anything. I’m so empty."
depression,"This world is CRUEL and UNFAIR I’m SICK of this world, why bad things keep happening on me? Out of MILLIONS of people, it chooses me. WHY? I have been suffering from various diseases and just yesterday, I was suspected to have glaucoma and will need further examination to confirm it soon. Just when I’m settle and comfortable with my situation, a new diseass comes knocking my door each every year. WHY? I’m sorry but there are a fuck ton of other people living as well, why not just distribute it evenly? Why must I bear ALL OF THE PAIN?

My plan is to go to college this July and finally starts to walk toward a better future. And my doctor suggested, it is not suitable for me with my condition. EVERYTIME I try to move forward, a fucking obstacles block my way, i mean it’s pretty normal for everyone, sure. You fail, you get back up, easy right? WELL YES EXCEPT THING WILL BE DIFFERENT WHEN THE FAIL IS A LETHAL DISEASE. People can just work their ass up to success but that is if you have the assets to do so.

People keep telling me, it gets better. OH YEAH, a year has passed and I got a new disease, are you going to say it’s going to get better next year too? When will it stop?

depression,"What now? Great, I've gone through another day, what now? Is there no reward for surviving each day? I seem to be stuck with this grand illusion that things will change. I've forgotten the reason why I keep going, I'm a robot, who's been switched to autonomous living. 

Is there really a purpose, or am I wasting my time barely hanging on to sanity. 

There isn't is there? Let me guess, it just keeps going. An infinite loop of pain and exhaustion. ""Life is what you make of it"" blah blah blah. Shit's pretty fucking hard to change when humans need to be motivated to do things. Depression's a bitch. An endless loop.

I'm a shell of the person I was"

depression,Talked to an old crush today Still hurts.
depression,"Despite the new rule I'd like some talk to Hello,

Firstly I don't think my depression is very bad as I can deal with most of the time but sometimes I wish I had someone to talk to.

I understand that dissapointment and such, so I'm okay if something doesn't work out and stop talking. Also please look at the rule page and find out why it's generally bad to offer private contact with a depressed individual.

Even if something doesn't work I'm 100% sure that I'll be fine, I have a lot of friends but sometimes I want someone who doesn't know me to sort of talk openly to. So if you're willing to just try, talk sometimes and *maybe* be friends, feel free to directly contact me on Reddit 

I'm sorry if this breaks the rules somehow.

My interests: drawing, video games, fashion, philosophy, music

depression,"Sure, most people feel alone, but what if you have literally never had anyone who cares about you? I used to be happy. I used to be fine occupying my time with hobbies and schools and the meaningless banter I had with my “friends”. Quarantine’s taken all of those away from me, and now the fact that my friends don’t and never have cared is amplified. I feel so lonely and cold all the time. I find myself wanting to snap at people who I used to like when they actually attempt to contact me for the first time in weeks. I can’t get in the zine anymore, I spend my days trying to distract myself with meaningless videos."
depression,acting happy has depleted everything I have had depression for a while now. There are certain ways I have become which has never been me before. It has become really hard for me to express any form of emotion. I am just emotionless now. It is not even that it is hard for me to express myself because there is nothing to express in the first place. I just feel like there is nobody that understands how I feel. One thing I’ve learned is that I’ve just been a burden to everyone in my life and lately I’ve been thinking how It would be much much better for the people around me if I’m just gone. As I said before I have no emotion to express but I have to be happy and normal for the people around me. For me even texting anyone takes a lot of energy from me and pretending to be happy makes everything 100 times more mentally exhausting. Everyone must be familiar with the phrase “nothing is sadder than meeting the right person at the wrong time.” I have met the right person for me but I never put in the right amounts of effort and i’m never able to keep them happy. I always feel irritable and angry but it’s like I forgot how to express it too now. I don’t have the energy to express my emotions and when I try to it makes me a lot lot worse. In my early stages I was able to have the slightest bit of hope and believe that it will be over but things have just went down so fast. What makes me feel even worse is at a point I started bringing my loved ones down with me. Even worse than this is that I brought a loved one down even more when they were going through a hard time of their own. What I’ve come to understand is that I have been drawback in everyone’s life. I love my significant other and that is really the only thing that makes me wake up everyday. But every day I pretend to be happy I only get worse. Fake laughing has become my thing. A small part of me doesn’t wanna leave this place because I have people that love me and I don’t wanna hurt them like I constantly have in the past so I don’t leave this place myself. I wish for my own disappearance instead. I wish for myself to be jumped. I wish for myself to be kidnapped. I wish for my life to be taken in some way or form. I wish for things like my own death on my birthday. As I pretend to be happy I only start wishing more. Has anyone felt anything like this or can anyone relate to me? Does anyone understand me?
depression,"I kinda miss my friends I used to be really close with them but they started to change. They started drinking and using drugs. And I didn’t want to do such things. They also thought their boyfriends where more important then me. (For example I didn’t celebrate my birthday with friends for 7 years after I got bullied. I finally trusted them enough to celebrate it with them but a week before that day two of them bailed on me because the only day they could hang out with their boyfriends was on that particular day. What a coincidence.)

Anyway after that incident I was done with them. I didn’t want to get hurt again. (All my friends abandoned me when I got bullied) I just saw  pictures of us together in happier times. It makes me so sad things turned out this way. Maybe I’m just a fuck up."
depression,"Looking through old pictures made me cry so much I was going through some baby pictures for senior stuff in high school. As I was going through the pictures trying to choose a picture I started tearing up, and this is all I've been thinking about all day. A couple of hours later past midnight, I was going through the same set of pictures and this time I started actually crying, I don't think I've ever cried like in this in the past 5 years but I don't think I've gotten so badly emotional so far in my life. I was thinking of how great life was back then, running around free, having a happy life, no stress. And now everything is the complete opposite for me. I'm about to start college in the next few months and I can assure you I can literally no clue about what I want to do, now in college and later in life, it just sucks thinking that you have to set up your future life from now on. I was having suicidal thoughts and what would've happened if I were dead, I will assure you that I'll never take away my own life for this but I've had thoughts about it. I've lived two years without my mom and brother so I've gone through depression, now luckily we all live together and I don't know if this situation is a one-time thing or if it will gradually increase my depression on top of what I have now because I've been sitting home all day doing absolutely nothing seeing times passing away so fast."
depression,"All I want is someone to talk to me and love me It feels like the only issue in my life is that no matter how hard I try, I’ll never convince anyone to like me."
depression,Just venting :) I’ve been seeing  a lot of videos recently of people sharing those close to them who have passed due to suicide. I know you can’t judge a book by its cover but they all looked beautiful and talented. Like they had a lot going for them but it was too painful to continue. People say we all have value but I can’t see mine and I’m definitely the opposite of talented. So what makes me so special that I should continue to live life. That I’m even worth fighting for. All the more reasons to just go..?
depression,"Apparently I’m just not a nice person 
People in my life take my genuine sadness as a sign that I’m just a mean bitch who doesn’t want to be around everyone. I’m sorry that I’m working during quarantine and it takes a huge percentage of my mental state to be nice and cater to strangers needs for 7 hrs a day. When I come home exhausted it’s not that I don’t care or love you.  I am just TRULY FUCKING TIRED."
depression,School year is about to end and my grades are absolutely horrible I have been an A and B student my whole life. I got transferred to a mental facility last month and it threw me off bad. I can’t find any motivation to do it. Quarantine really fucked me over too.

depression,"Depression and ADHD I am 26 and Female. I just found out I have ADHD...yeah I'm finally relieved to know why I was so high strung. I also realize I have depression badly and I am in the process for treating it. Anyone else have these things and how do you deal with it if so? I'm tires of feeling depressed on a daily basis. It's like now that I am taking Adderall for ADHD, which really helps, I still feel unhappy and it's hard to find pleasure in activities most days though, which is what it was like before I started adderall. I'm just curious if anyone has any experience with these two mental disorders."

I have failed couple classes throughout the college year, but this semester I really fucked up. 

Ever since quarantine started, I just lost everything. I just stay in my bed and stare at my phone all day. I have been depressed and do not want to do anything. I have not touched any of school work since the quarantine started and this was supposed to be my last semester. I just want to disappear and not do anything. 

I do not know what to do with myself. I am going to fail the entire semester and waste all the money..."

One is telling me to make me happy i should seek help but the other is telling me seeking help is selfish and that others need it more. only issue is: that can't be right because if i don't seek help that will bring me closer to suicide which is the most selfish thing to do, thereby making it selfish not to get help. but then if i seek help i know in my heart I'm doing it because I'm selfish and can't stand attention being on anyone else except me. So then i start thinking selfishly about what makes me happy and if i seek help then I'll be less sad because I'll be getting the help i need but then I'll be sad because then someone else will have to waste there time helping me and I'll be taking attention from someone else. But then if i don't seek help i won't be happy because I'm not getting the help i need. Either way i lose. It's a catch 22. I can't even ask someone else if i should ask for help or not cause that in itself is a cry for help.

I seek help = selfish -&gt; sad
I don't seek help -&gt; suicide = selfish -&gt; sad

I guess if I'm posting this I've made my mind, I'm just not sure if it was the correct one."
depression,"What am I doing with my life? Coming onto reddit at 3 in the morning to tell a bunch of random people that life fucking sucks. I don't know how till bree happy anymore, I don't know what to do to be happy anymore. Everyone else seems happy, or at least content. Why do I feel like literal garbage, like I don't matter. 

Wish I had my job back so I didn't have so much fucking time to think about how useless I really am."
depression,"You know it’s getting bad when you can’t even be bothered to get up to make food Agh how I loved my pizza or my Nutella toast , it would be the dopamine I needed in order to get by and nowadays can’t even be bothered to make anything , the thought of getting up and standing is dreadful , I’d rather just lay in my bed or sleep."
depression,"Life feels meaningless I am a 21 year old university student who is failing her classes. I just feel so uninspired. I have no idea what it is that I want out of life. I have no dream or passion. I don't exactly have the best family or friend group. And I'm poor! lol. I wonder if I can ever feel true happiness?  I wonder if life can have meaning. I wonder if I can experience joy and excitement. I'm just so sick of my boring, stressful, everyday life."
depression,Didn’t think it would be like this Wake up -&gt; job and/or distractions -&gt; sleep. No one cares enough about us. Bcuz of this I have started to live in my own world bcuz fuck ppl. Then there is also the boringness and loneliness being too much
depression,4:28 am The usual. I’m sad but nobody listens anyways. So honestly it doesn’t matter. This will just be buried along with other comments.
depression,Feeling awful I was triggered by something :/ a story of suicide. Thought it wouldn’t effect me but it’s killing me and made me want to do it more idk what to do rn. I’d like someone to talk to
depression,"Extreme weight loss Can’t be asked to eat , why should I even bother feeding a body that can’t even function normally , where’s my dopamine? 

Where’s my serotonin , where’s my will to live . Bullshit ass life always just dragging me along , why can’t it all just go away."
depression,"Our community lockdown will now be lifted. The city I live in has adapted to the ""new normal"" and I'm still stuck inside my own head struggling to blend in.

Waking up after an 8-hour sleep with a racing heart is already a struggle. And if our governor won't appeal for a quarantine extension, then I'm doomed!

I don't want the quarantine period to end. I don't want to feel so alone. I'm so tired dealing with myself already. So tired of trying. So tired of pretending that I'm with them. I know I am being selfish but this is the first time in awhile that I've felt comforted outside my comfort zone.

I'm sorry. I see people struggling financially but I'm not. I see people wanting the lockdown to come to an end ... but I'm not."
depression,"I hate myself I used to be a pretty charming and cool kid when I was younger and really felt borderline on top of the world. After a few things happened to me, a squatting (lifting) injury, other injuries, bad betrayals by ‘friends’, my body is a mess causing me to do just about everything I do very awkwardly which is painful to know and I feel like a joke and a lost human. I used to be cool and athletic, and I am now in young adulthood with no confidence and an uncoordinated body. How does that even happen?

My chronic anxiety and depression are so hard to explain to anybody and I don’t think anybody I know really wants to hear me talk about my problems because they see me as a sob case of how far down I’ve come. My girlfriend is the only one I confide things in as when I’ve opened up to others they just shake my thoughts off as nothing, which makes me feel dumb for bringing it up, but then later on I wish I had said more. I just don’t have the guts to do so. My girlfriend says others look up to me and that I’m genuinely well-liked by everyone, but I never truly believe any of the things she says - which hurts me a ton. My mind is so fucked that I can’t even believe the things she’s saying to me, even when I know she loves me. I feel like she just puts up with the strange parts about me.

Even around my caring and loving family, I feel like I’m trying every second to just be normal and it never feels like it works. I’m so strong mentally and it’s the only reason I’ve made it to this point, but I just hate myself deep down and don’t know how to fix whatever is wrong with me. I want to be normal, but I don’t know what normal is anymore. I’d almost describe myself as half-dissociated half of the time. It’s always a battle to stay in the moment.

I have nearly no pride in my self, feel no sense of normalcy, and have constant thoughts of self hate running through my head. I just hope that things get better. I keep trying as hard as I can but they don’t."
depression,"Even if I get everything I want, I'll still be depressed/unhappy I don't even know why.  Why can't this feeling just go away?  It's hell"
depression,"What do I do about this? I'm Male in a strict conservative family.

Today I learned my parents thing I'm gay and I'm not. (I dont have anything against that either.)

I cant convince them otherwise and it's really getting to me."
depression,"I’m afraid of failing high school and I’ve kinda toyed with the idea of offing myself Since the covid outbreak, school have all been shut down and relocated online. I’ve been severely struggling to keep on track with everything and it’s just spiraled out of control
I’m currently failing some of my classes and I feel like I’m just losing control in general. Never been a big fan of life anyways and actually tried to kill myself before but obviously it didn’t work. Recently I’ve been having issues sleeping and I’ve been trying some at home remedy’s. I won’t lie, I’ve considered asking for some prescription sleep aids and just O.Ding on that. Honestly I know it’s morbid and this isn’t a call to help or anything or even a suicide note. Simply a statement of where my mind is right now with all this. Anyways , thanks for taking the time to read!"
depression,"Advice? I’ve been deep in my depression lately, I’ve got so many worries and stress and hate for my life but I’m just unable to talk about it with my therapist. He’s great and nice and all but every time we have a session I’m just not able to talk about my problems. I’ve been suicidal for the first time in my life, I’m completely incapable of doing schoolwork, I’m scared, I’m alone, I hate so much about my life, but every time I just blank. I end up saying the same shit each time and then when it’s over I just break down. I don’t know why I have this block, maybe it’s just from years of never talking about my problems or something but if anyone has any pointers that would be very appreciated. Thank you."
depression,"... My divorce is soon to be finalized and it’s been such a painful experience. I decided I would be the one to take care of it because he was stressing over so many things in his life. But it’s been so hard on me , to do something I don’t want. The moment I saw the email from my lawyer saying I just need to file whatever she sent, broke me. I broke down, it literally eats me to hold my tears and sign the paperwork. The fact that I have to act like it never happened... that shit really fucken hurts. I loved being his wife..."
depression,"i’m finally going to therapy after years of not seeking help because of my parents and because i kept trying to convince myself i didn’t need it, i’m finally seeing a therapist. at first it was terrifying (it still is) but after a few sessions i’m feeling a bit more comfortable opening up again. i’m letting myself be vulnerable again, but maybe this is what i need to start feeling better"
depression,"Panic attacks woke me twice today I've been feeling a little extra down at the end of the day yesterday and decided to turn it in early when it was the kid's bedtime.  I just wanted the day to be over.  I've been having a pretty good couple of days just before and I just hit that crash we eventually get and I remember all the reasons why I hate myself and that nagging voice comes back with vengeance from being silent for so long.  I kept imagining my phone going off so I would check it.  Then I woke up and I was absolutely covered in sweat, I couldn't breathe, and there was a lump in my throat.  I got myself out of it, played a little games, mad went back to sleep.  Two hours later and I'm on the floor in my bathroom.  Im still shaking.  I have no one to talk to, so here I am again.  Just emptying my thoughts and feeling into the void hoping to not feel so alone and empty.  In the daytime it's better cause usually when I get a panic attack I can hug my daughter.  She makes me feel like a hero.  She's one of the only people that make me feel good.  I ruin everything else.  I get worried that one day she'll realize I'm not a hero.  That I'm broken and don't deserve love.  But for now I'm a hero to someone.  At least to someone."
depression,"Drinking......ALOT, listening to lil peep thinking about ending it short Going through a bad break up, and hating life godspeed for all the soldiers who are still going."
depression,"""No one will help you, if you won't help yourself"" Upon coming to the realization that someone in my life may be holding me back from getting better, I made the decision to just back off and not look at them on the same level again for a long time, if ever.

For the last several months, I have been at their beck and call. Not going to distort the truth, they've been there for me too. However, they have become increasingly distant, and now; they leave me on read unless they actually feel like talking to me.

I have attempted, several times; to reach out to them and try to make things work. Now? I simply can't do it anymore. 

During a conversation the other night, they said, ""No. You're not forcing things."" Which I now see as being correct, because they're the one forcing us to stay friends. They feel like they can walk all over me, and treat me like shit; yet they expect me to be there when they need me. That is not how it works, and I've allowed it to go on for far too long.

""Hurt people, hurt people""

""Broken people, break people""

Those two sayings are so true. I am hurt. I am broken. This friend of mine is too. Which is why I need to put my foot down, one and for good, and cut them out of my life."
depression,"Nourish the mind Whatever we plant in our subconscious mind and nourish with repetition and emotion will one day become a reality!
This is why it is so important that we don't pay too much attention to our negative thoughts. Identify them, accept them and distract from them. Notice the positives, feed your mind the fuel to feel the good and helpful ❤"
depression,"Dunno what title give Hi, I m a 18 man. I've been left by my gf one year ago and I can't get over it.
We had been together for 2 and a half years, but after 6 months during which I became addict to her, needing to see her every week and talking to her every single minute she had, she decided to break up after staying with me for an entire month without any love feeling left just by kindness.
But I transformed this kindness into hatred by harassing her and her friends on social networks for weeks. She got to play dead on every single medium where I could contact her and block me aswell.
I didn't either see her face, hear her voice or talk to her for 10 months but I still think of her everyday. 
I hate myself as much as I love her and I would want never to have existed, for her sake. I take medication and see a psycologist, since 15 months, but my feelings just don't go away. I cry almost every night thinking that I transformed her no-limit love for me into pure hatred and disgust, that I would want to exchange my life for her hapiness or her father's life who died during our relationship and who would have made her way happier.
Just thinking that she probably has a new boyfriend makes me have panic attack.
I don't know what I except by posting this here.. maybe more hatred."
depression,"It's too quiet in the house without the kids They're at their mom's today and I have the house all to myself. I spent the day sleeping, laying in bed, playing games on my phone. I couldn't do anything productive. When the kids are here, they're the reason I get up in the morning, clean or do laundry, cook, shop. I miss them.

I'm resorting to putting a twitch stream on to hear a voice while I try to sleep. Just...

lonely.

I hope tomorrow is a better day."
depression,"I have fallen into the dark mindset again. I'm familiar with this feeling too much. It is like a depressive state that covers me for some time and then goes away ( at least it always used to before). 

I don't know exactly when was ""the breaking point"" but at around last wednesday i began feeling hopeless, unmotivated, sad and suicidal. Actually when i found out that my favorite activities remain closed until fucking august it really made me upset. 

Everytime i go back from work i don't feel like doing anything and i have a lot to do, on my free days i oversleep hugely just because dreams seem to bet far more interesting and thrilling than this real life is. I was working on my healthy routines but now everything just fell apart...

What makes this worse is that i live abroad away from my family, i don't have any friends here either."
depression,"Seeking help but can’t find anything :( This whole year sucks. Like ABSOLUTELY sucks :(

My mental health has gone on the decline, to a point where I’ve made a date and a plan, I dread sleep every day, I’m procrastinating on every single responsibility, even as simple as cleaning my apartment or taking a shower.

I really tried finding a therapist. The first one didn’t work out, his style and method didn’t work w me (it was the type where I lead discussion and I do Not vibe w that ajskajsak), the second one who was my previous therapist last year in a different state said I should find a new therapist in my community, and the third one hasn’t even responded to the email I sent last week. 

I really wanted to get a therapist thru this “Lyra Health” program rhat gives you 20 free sessions on behalf of ur company’s benefits, but it only gives me four options, and only one is one I would consider (and lo and behold she’s the one who isn’t responding).

Am I being too picky? I know I shouldn’t feel this way but the back of my mind is urging me that this is just a sign that I’m not meant to find help 

What am I supposed to do if I can’t find therapy? It literally took me 3-4 weeks between each therapist to get the energy / courage to email each one, one at a time. This should be so much simpler than it is for me"
depression,"This subreddit makes me kinda sad. So yes, I believe it’s a beautiful platform that allows people to connect with other people who feel the same way but at the same time, you see some posts with thousands of upvotes, and then you see other people’s posts with none, or even some that have been downvoted and the only thing that goes through my head when I see that is ‘am i (or them) not depressed enough. What did I do wrong’ i believe that a lot of people are extremely discouraged by this, in a way, the place they came to to get something off their chest, just made them feel worse. I don’t know. Just someone that’s been on my mind. I guess it’s just me overthinking again."
depression,"I’ve never felt so low I [25M] had the worst night of my life, I’ve got a huge knot in my back that’s preventing me from getting the little sleep I’d usually get. Plus I’ve been feeling physically sick, and my moods been at the lowest I think it’s ever been. I just lay there with these negative thoughts going round and round in my head getting worse all the time. I used to have someone I could talk to but they’re going through their own thing and need their space, now I have no one to share things with. I just want the world to open up and swallow me and take me away. For the last few weeks the nights have been tough but last night was a really difficult one. Dunno what to do or who to tell so thought I’d unload it on here"
depression,"On the days you struggle to function or eat, what are your go-to foods to get you through the day alive? On bad depression days, I barely manage eat anything, let alone get out of bed or maintain basic hygiene. More often than not i eat about one meal a day - if 2 eggs can even be considered a “meal”, or simply binge on cookies. Went through a couple fainting spells last year, one of which broke my damn ankle. Crippled life did wonders for my depression, of course. Can see it happening again this summer, with the heat and dryness settling in. What’s your go-to quick fix to keep yourself from malnutrition? (I.e. Easy meals, efficient/high nutrition, easiest to stomach with zero appetite, etc.)


My depression pantry generally includes:
- EmergenC/Vitamin drink
- Meal-in-one protein bars (my LIFESAVER)
- Frozen dumplings
- Frozen veggies
- Hot chocolate powder
- Eggs &amp; bananas if i’m able to do groceries. 
- Boxed fruit juice (I usually never drank juice, but they’re essential for when you’re low on fluids and sugar/vitC, esp outside of home)
- HELLA comfort snacks. I dedicate an entire “apocalypse cupboard” to this lol. Don’t even hesitate to buy 10 boxes of your favourite cookies. Depression can be unpredictable, so try to ration them for bad days. (Note: take caution if this is triggering for any eating disorders)


Frozen meals and take-out delivery work too, of course. It just gets extremely pricey in the long-run. Plus it involves stepping out the door and interacting with the delivery guy... sometimes that’s just NOT happening lmao. 


Thanks for reading my post! This is honestly crucial for anyone who lives alone... it can be so dangerous if we collapse (or worse) and nobody realizes soon enough. Sadly I don’t exactly have anyone i see or talk to/check-in with on a daily basis, so it’ll probably be like 3+ days before someone discovers my starved dead body. 


PRO TIP: don’t spend an entire year immobile in bed and relying 80% of your food intake solely on cookies. You’ll be constipated for 6 months. A chronic pain in ass is NOT FUN. 10/10 would not do again. Lesson learned - STOCK UP ON FROZEN VEGGIES. And try to drink some water. Seriously. My asshole is traumatized. Good luck."
depression,"Does depression always stems from a traumatic event? When I was 17 I started to experience severe depression and anxiety, like I had never felt in my life. I left for college, and at 19 I dropped out because my anxiety was so bad that I couldn't pass an exam. Now, I'm nearly 21 and I spend almost everyday trying to figure out why I act like I went through something traumatic and horrible. I have a loving, supportive family, my childhood was not particularly bad-- I just don't understand. Though I can name a good few things that I think might have caused all of this, I'm wondering if that even matters? Does it always have to come from some sort of trauma? Or does my mind maybe classify simple things as trauma? I keep trying to find something to blame, but I always find myself saying ""well, that's not traumatic enough to have caused me to be this way."" I just want to know why I became this way, when I was fine for the first 16 years of my life."
depression,"Can’t even be depressed in peace , leave me alone . Since quarantine I’ve been living with my bf and this has been a struggle, he’s not depressed or is ever in a mood and I’m always fluctuating between sad and sadder , he’s always around asking me what’s wrong ,  leave me alone , I just don’t feel like talking ,I just don’t feel like spending time , can I just lay and stare at my phone pointlessly for hours in peace .   Why do people always expect you to have an explanation or why do they feel like you owe them an answer , nothing is wrong , sometimes I just feel trash ,I just wanna be left alone ."
depression,"Money depression I’ve worked for 7 months through my mental health issues to save as much money as I can for a car. Now I’m buying one! But it’s going to leave me with almost no savings in my bank. I’m spending the money on what I was saving for, so I should feel good, but I don’t. I know as soon as I see the balance after I’ve spent my money I’m going to feel really bad. Is this normal? I feel like I’m going to feel a big sense of hopelessness and lack of motivation, because ultimately I know all the money I save actually has to be spent eventually. :("
depression,"I don't want to do anything. No, I don't wake up feeling energized.  
I don't feel that ''every day is worth living''.  
I don't want to get things done. I do it because I have to.   
I don't want to go outside.  
I don't even want to exist.

Doing things depress me more. Having things to do creates endless anxiety and discomfort of the thought of having to do them sooner or later.

  
Sorry just wanted to rant. I feel like no one gets this. I don't want to do anything. Literally I just want to be in my bed watch anime/Netflix or sit on my computer every day. Literally every day until I die. I don't want to accomplish anything. I don't have ambitions, talents or anything of that sort.

depression,"Gf broke up with me, lost dog, feel like I have no purpose in life. This is my first post ever, but I figured maybe I can find some help here. I (25 m) was dating my gf (26 f) for a little over a year, she had a lot of trauma and being with her was difficult yet rewarding. She was also very beautiful and highly intelligent, guys were trying left and right to get with her and she chose me. Things eventually died out and the passion was gone on top of arguing all the time.

In recent months she moved due to an unfortunate circumstance and the new place didn't allow dogs, so I took her dog in and I was supposed to have him for about 4 months. I had never had a dog before but I became extremely attached after having him for a month and so did my parents, he was my best friend during quarantine. I should also mention that I have no siblings, and no one that I call my best friend. 

She broke up with me yesterday and she took her dog with her. I feel like I've lost the 2 most important things in my life all in one blow. I am not working right now because of covid. I have literally nothing to do, nothing to look forward to, I feel empty, I feel cold, and I catch myself staring at nothing multiple times throughout the day for minutes on end. Taking care of the dog gave me purpose, something to do, and love from the dog. I am not stupid enough to do anything about it, but I feel like I don't want to wake up. Like I want to just not exist any more because I have no purpose in life. I feel extremely alone and desolate. 

If anyone can help at all, offer advice, or just let me know that I'm not alone. Idk. Thank you so much for reading this."
depression,Overthinking in quarantine Anyone else literally thinking about everything in life? I’m just alone with my thoughts and thinking of all of the regrets and failures in my life.

depression,"The pain that pleasure brings Hi all, I posted this at [dispellingmyths.com](https://dispellingmyths.com), but thought it would also be relevant for people here.

&amp;#x200B;

People think that pleasure brings happiness, in truth it often brings pain, but the connection is not immediately obvious, so the cycle of pursuing pleasure only for it to disappoint continues. There is nothing inherently bad or wrong about pleasure, however, in modern society it’s often too easy to acquire which throws a cog in the works of our reward circuitry. We have evolved such that the pleasure we experience is preceded by effort or hard work. If you imagine a hunter gatherer on the hunt for much needed calories in the form of an animal of some kind. This would often require much effort and disappointment before finally hunting down and killing the prey. After which, the rewards could be enjoyed. Today, we only have to log onto are smart phone to order take away or go to the fridge. The reward is easy to acquire, so what happens is people over-indulge, until the law of diminishing marginal returns takes effect. Afterwards what happens is people either feel sick or generally lethargic with low energy.  That’s just food, this dynamic also occurs with alcohol, drugs, porn, masturbation, video games and so on.  Ask any parent, the most delicious and satisfying tea and toast they will every have is the tea and toast served by maternity nurses after a difficult labour and the healthy baby is finally delivered. The effort made the tea and toast so satisfying.

What I think is happening when we experience too much reward with little effort, is our dopamine receptors become desensitized. Meaning day to day activities which should be enjoyable and give us motivation are either irritating or devoid of any enjoyment, activities such as going for a walk, having a conversation with a friend, enjoying nature or the practice which is required to learn a skill or craft. It becomes almost impossible to master a skill because you simply don’t have the will power to endure such irritating and tedious practice on a consistent basis for the length of time necessary to master the skill. The pleasure people routinely pursue is inadvertently making them miserable, or even depressed. They are addicted to the instant gratification, they lose their ability to focus on a specific task for any length of time. The solution is counter intuitive, bring more pain into your life if you want to be happy on a day to day basis. When people seek happiness in pleasure it results in a very bad deal. You get a few minutes of pleasure in exchange for consistent low-level pain on a day to day basis. You get social anxiety, you get depression, you get a lack of motivation, low work ethic, lack of inspiration. Choose instant pleasure at your peril, it is the deal with the devil. When you choose a small amount of pain it can bring joy and satisfaction, motivation, inspiration to you on a day to day basis. Try having a cold shower in the morning, pushing yourself to the limit when you exercise, leaving your comfort zone by doing something that scares you. Trying new things that makes you uncomfortable. What I think you’ll find is these painful activities result in more happiness than the instant pleasure can ever bring."
depression,"Perfectionism about height Hi so I was born with a chronic infection called chronic hepatitis b, and I recently learned that living with this can stunt growth because your body is perpetually fighting the virus. Ever since I discovered this fact, I became so depressed and don’t want to do anything, I always have had a shitty mindset towards life and myself, I obsess with regrets, regret that I am not in a state of perfect, regret not properly taking care of myself growing up, regret skipping sleep, and stressful moments, basically regrets about past choices in my life that I could have changed to prevent damage to my attributes such as IQ or intelligence, success, height, face, etc. The more I read up on scientific research and studies about how the little things can affect growth, the more I feel like shit because I was naive as a kid and my parents weren’t great at all, I was not treated for the infection until I was 18, we had no clue it was present."
depression,"Do apps for depression work? I’ve tried a couple some years back, I don’t remember which ones, and I kinda hated them. So I’m wondering, had anyone used any? If so, what were your thoughts? Were there any that worked for you, ones you like, ones that were shit? 

I’m thinking about downloading and trying again with some but I’m not sure where to start and I’d love to hear about others experiences."
depression,"How can I go on living knowing that I’ll just continue to be a disappointment. I’m 19 now going on 20 in August, and everyday I think about how fucked up I’ve managed to make my life and myself, knowing full-well that I’ll never be able to make my family (or myself) proud the way I want to. 

It’s always the fucking case that whatever I do is NEVER good enough for anyone- not good enough for them, and by extension, not good enough for me. Look at Tyler, that nice boy you went to high-school with- he just finished that class you dropped, why is it SO HARD for you? Are you stupid or something? Or, is that the best you could do? I would’ve much rather preferred *insert stupid fucking expectation here,* but yours is okay. Manifesting with the bad thoughts I already have about my own capabilities in my head, I absolutely ADORE being criticized constantly. Probably never going to be able to be the “perfect son” or “perfect fucking brother” or perfect whatever, I’m constantly haunted by the fact that I’ll just never be good enough in my family’s eyes. 

Oh yeah, and don’t forget to mention that I’ll never be able to live up to their crazy expectations of me, particularly the one where I marry this perfect woman that’ll take care of me and my family! Why not? Well maybe it’s because I’m FUCKING GAY everyone, sorry for fucking GOING AGAINST OUR CATHOLIC WAYS and believing in what you call to be, “confusing thoughts that are unnatural.” 

I’ll never fucking win- it’s a loser’s game. If I do what they want, I’m unhappy and disappointed in myself. If I do what I want, they’re unhappy and will probably fucking banish me from the family. 

I just want to live my life without these fucking expectations. I want to not have to change who I truly am to try and satisfy their desires. I want to be fucking LOVED for who I am and they way I know I deserve. But in doing so I’ll always be a disappointment- and everyday I can feel little parts of any sort of optimism for my future slowly dying away, along with the rest of my happiness."
depression,"I will claim my life back. After a few years of post-traumatic emotional and mental abuse, I was left careerless, in a very bad shape and extremely poor health. Depression had me bedridden, my teeth health deteriorated and I put on almost double the original size. Hygiene was the last thing on my mind. I did not take bath at all.

Long story short, I am a 31 year old female, 5 feet 3 inches tall, weight unmeasured right now but morbidly obese. I used to be a happy, healthy, humorous, hygienic and beautiful woman but shit happens. I was a victim of circumstances. BUT now I reclaim my life back. 

My plan:

1) Teeth health
2) Mental health
3) Physical health

Physical health will begin by getting back in shape. I have no other way but to fast. I have done it before on several occasions when I was conscious of my health.

WEIGHT LOSS 

I took a herbal laxative right now. It will cleanse my system and prevent further reflux during the period of the fast.

For the first 7 days starting May 13 to May 19, I will do a detox diet. In those 7 days, I will drink only Green tea, Slimming tea, Cumin tea, Lemon water and other homemade detox waters.  

For the next 5 days thereafter, I will do a soft dry fast  Soft because I have to focus on my hygiene again. I cannot avoid the water now. 

For the next 21 days thereafter, I will do water fasting.

On 14th June, I will update the next plan. But till then I will do regular and daily updates on various subreddits of fasting, dry fasting, teeth hygiene, depression, meditation, spirituality.  

My weight loss and mental health will be documented through the entire process.

I need your blessings. Thank you."
depression,"I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. I've been feeling this way for some time now. As a high school senior, everyday I had been coming home from school and instantly jumped to my computer to play games, ignoring my responsibilities and schoolwork. It seems that things have caught up to me now and I'm overwhelmed by everything that I have to study for finals that are happening in a few weeks. 

So now I'm in this giant grave that I've dug myself but it still feels... stoic? I'm stuck in this loop where I really need to get to study but I can't sit at my studying desk for more than 5 minutes without fidgeting, but then I think see how much I have to study and how hard it is, I can't do it. My parents surely have high expectations on me to ace on my finals but I just can't do it. I can't bring myself to study because I know I will fail anyway.

It's not just with studying that I struggle to start doing. I don't do my chores anymore, or cooking, or even eating because I can't bring myself out of bed sometimes. I don't talk to anyone, not even to my parents or my brother. I hate how depressing I have become. 

I don't know... I don't want to be like this anymore... I want to start being productive and not a disappointment to my parents... Please someone help me..."

depression,"Mental health awareness month upsets me sometimes Upsetting seeing people you know post about mental health and how important it is and do these ‘challenges’ but when you bring up your mental health or your mental illness symptoms act up and you’re struggling, they are the last people to care or the first to say they can’t deal with you. I’m all for mental health awareness and am even in a support group but idk it just upsets me a lot. Anyone else? :("

depression,"I am a failure in life 10 years ago I was disappointed with my life, hoping things would get better. They only got worse.

I failed to make anything of my education, and I have been out of school for 3 years now with nothing to show for it. Members of my graduating class have found meaningful careers, succeeded in their goals, and have traveled the world.

In comparison, I am an unemployed, friend-less, broke 25 year old who lives with his mother, with no real work history, no positive life experiences, and no savings. My life is empty and I am not in control.

Now the world is shut down and it is harder than ever to find work. I enjoy nothing and often wish I were never born. I don't mean ""such and such didn't go my way ugh wish I was dead lol it's not a phase mom"", I mean I genuinely wish my existence never occurred.

I feel deep shame for who I am and what I have done. I have had very few social interactions in my life, and I'd say a good 90% of them have involved me embarrassing myself. I'm no good at living, people don't like me for good reason, and I wouldn't want my own company if I met myself. I've ruined the opportunities I've had and I can't defend myself when my family put me down for my failed life because haven't got a leg to stand on.

I wish I hadn't put myself through such an unnecessary traumatic abusive relationship. I am such a fool for letting myself be walked all over like that by a girl who wasn't worth much more than trash. I humiliated myself in front of my entire high school being with her, and it still haunts me at the age of 25. I feel so much shame that I cross the street and avoid eye contact when I see someone from my alma mater walking in my direction. Any sexual confidence has been destroyed after she informed the masses that I couldn't perform due to anxiety. I worry that it would recur in the future and thus I have no confidence to pursue intimate relationships.

I have been trying to turn things around for years now, but it hasn't worked. Therapy has failed. Trying to go back to school has drained what little money I had. No one wants to hire me because I have nothing to offer. I have never been on a date or had a healthy romantic relationship, nor have I ever spent time with friends. Exercise doesn't change my mood, it only makes me feel bad that I've wasted so much time on fitness for a subpar body.

I cannot change these things because they all require things I don't possess: the approval of others, attractive qualities, money, a family in which I belong, social contact, self confidence and self worth.

I wish at the very least that I were someone else. It saddens me to no end how worthless I am. I have failed to launch, I have failed to grow, I have failed to become half the man I hoped to be, and I have failed to learn anything from my extremely poor choices. 

I am truly a life failure."
depression,"Week 5 50mg zoloft. Please help Hi this’ll be kind of long but please read and respond with any advice/insight. 
I had my first anxiety attack in January. I got home around 3am that night and I felt like my heart was going to fall out of my chest. Of course immediately I thought it was a heart attack. I felt fine the next day and was back to normal the day after that. In March I started to feel very anxious, and unlike myself. I ended up going to the doctor and she prescribed hydroxyzine since it happened more towards the evening/night and I couldn’t sleep due to the anxiety. I did not take it much as it made me feel groggy. I dealt with the anxiety for about a month until it turned into what I believe is depression, as I was crying everyday most of the day, had a decreased appetite, didn’t want to communicate with anyone or get out of bed, and in increase in panic attacks. I do believe my anxiety/depression was stress induced as I worked 2 full time jobs and went to school full time as well as trying to balance a social life. I finally went and got put on Zoloft. I started with 25mg the first week and then increased to 50mg per my PCP. I’m currently on week 4 of 50mg (5 weeks of Zoloft total). I do feel better as I’m not crying every day and I’m not having panic attacks often. But I do still have a bit of trouble sleeping at night as I feel like my heart is going crazy. I had a EKG done when I was first prescribed the hydroxyzine and everything came back normal with my heart. But why do I still feel my heart acting weird? What is causing it? My pulse is usually in the 80’s-90’s when I check it so it’s not racing, but I feel my heart fluttering and I feel my heart beat is strong. It feels like my heart is skipping a beat. It happens more when I’m laying it bed trying to go to sleep. I also feel on edge. I get scared when I think about hanging out with others (when social distancing is over). I just feel this fear come over me. I feel like my General state is just waiting for an anxiety attack to happen. I feel so on edge all the time. Is this normal? Does Zoloft help eventually? Do I need to up my dosage? Or give it time? Any advice would help! Thank you so much!!  

tl;dr: on week 4 of 50mg of zoloft (week 5 total) and I still feel my heart fluttering and my heart beating lousy (like it’s skipping a beat). Does it go away? Do I need to up my dosage or give it time? It feels stronger when I’m laying down not doing anything and trying to go to sleep."
depression,Have you lost interest in everything too? I can’t take this anymore. I feel so lifeless. Everything bores me to death. I can’t find meaning in anything. I can’t even feel love. I’m so desperate to feel alive again. Any advice?
depression,"I stay in a job I hate just so I can feel angry about it. At least this way I can feel something. When I have a day off I just sink.  The job keeps me getting out of bed but I've been slowly getting worse at it.

I quit drinking two years ago hoping it would help with my depression.  I mean I guess it has but I don't really remember.  I was a blackout drunk which I guess was just a half-assed daily suicide.  It killed my ability to think anyway.

I do worry that quitting drinking made me worse at my job.  I'm in sales and it's all about being social and friendly.  Without the booze I'm more inhibited and self conscious which is killing my confidence.  

If things continue my employer will let me go, then I won't have the job to be angry about.  I tell others that it would be a blessing since I'm always angry... but the truth is its probably the last thing keeping me hanging on.  Plus there's so many people looking for work I'm lucky to have a job.

Family hates me, no significant other, no kids nor pets.  All my friends were drinking buddies so they're gone.  Being angry at work has killed off all workplace acquaintances.  

I'm exhausted.  I'm too tired to start over again.  I'm too old to start over again.  I clearly can't make good decisions since I keep ending up here.  At this fucking dead end.

Time to get ready for work."

I absolutely hate the job I’m in, though. It’s long hours and very high stress and my superiors don’t believe in showing any appreciation for the work we put in. I’m not sure if this is the cause but I’m so apathetic to everything right now. I think the worst in people, I assume this girl that I’m with isn’t into me, I feel like the friend group I’m in is starting to turn on me, I’m beating myself up a lot in my head for small things, and on top of it I feel really bad for complaining when I have a perfectly good life. 

I just have a general feeling of sadness I can’t really explain. I need to be a better member of my family. I put in minimal effort cause I can get away with it and I hate that. Idk why I’m posting this or here but I just feel nothing when I’m supposed to feel something and when I do feel something it’s usually a negative.

depression,"Dealing with depressed spouse I just wanted some advice. I think my husband is depressed and I am struggling to cope. 

He is always in a bad mood, his mood swings are horrendous and at least 5 days out of 7 he is in a terrible mood and he takes it out on me and my young daughter, snapping at us, he storms around the house and makes the atmosphere really bad. 

He doesnt help out much around the house or with our daughter. The days where he is in a 'down' day which is the majority of the time he just sits on his phone and ignores her. Which breaks my heart for her.

Today is a bad day for him and its like walking on egg shells, I was assaulted when I was 16 which he knows about and I do not like to be sexually touched unexpectedly as it shocks me and brings back feelings of things being outside my control. So I was in the kitchen and he snuck behind me and grabbed the underside of my bum. I said to him 'don't do that' he responds with 'why"" so I said 'I don't like it when you do that'. Anyway he lost it, threw his phone and has been upstairs since. I feel like I'm not even allowed to Have a say around my own feelings because it sets him off.

I'm a naturally positive and upbeat person and I am finding I am in a bad mood more often bscsuse of the negativity than I usually am, and I am worried about my bad moods and his effecting my daughter. 

He is a wonderful person but I feel like he is being lost in what I suspect is depression. I do not know how to help him. I have said many times about speaking to a doctor but he doesn't have that mentality. He has told me in the past he has a view of 'you just have to get on and deal with stuff'. He has never previously shown mebor my daughter any care with any emotional pain, even physical pain becsuse he has such a warped view on things. By his own account, he lacks any sort of empathy for other people. So I do not know how to get through to someone who has beliefs such as this. As selfish as it sounds I keep thinking about leaving him until he does get help.

I love my husband but I do not like him right now, which I feel horrific for and I do not know what to do.

Does anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation?

Please do not reply if you're going to suggest getting divorced, or anything negative such as this. I just want constructive ideas and ways to help.

Thank you."
depression,"IM GETTING READY TO HANG MYSELF SOMEONE TELL ME LIFE GETS BETTER PLZ I’m about done with it I can’t cope anymore I’m going thru real real problems. When I was 16(early 2019) I developed chronic neuropathy (nerve damage) and I don’t entirely know how but it’s either from a antibiotic, or a vaccine which I don’t remember it’s one of those you get forced to take. Pain, feet that fell asleep and never woke up, pain, tingling, muscle twitching everywhere, did I say pain. I have periods where I feel fine and some times where my nerves are yelling at me to kill myself. I’m in that right now. And now I’m having unexplained stomach pain (unrelated) me being a hypochondriac I don’t know if it’s an emergency or not, it’s been a week. The anxiety killed the boy. Also me having a sinus problem which is making the bones around my eyes deteriorate and need reconstructive surgery I can’t anymore I’m only 17. I’ve fought to the last breath. I wanted so bad to have a family have a big house be an entrepreneur be fucking rich but that life is OVER DONE FOR DONE DEAL. It’s either I kill myself or I’m gonna become a heroin/morphine addict"
depression,"Maybe it’s time for a change? I have always wanted to kill myself. It’s just something that pops in my brain when things spiral out. Fight with boyfriend? Just do it. Panic attack? It’s only going to get worse. Hard day at work? No one is going to miss you.

In all honesty, I think my depression will kill me in the long run. I’ve tried antidepressants and they did more bad than good. Therapy helps me a lot, but I can’t risk saying “you know what sounds really good? Death” without alarms, and I get sent to the hospital. I can’t bring it up to my support system since I’ll probably end up in the hospital too. I feel like I can’t bring things topic up without getting reprimanded. I do know that these thoughts of suicide stem from my depression. The stress and anxiety from COVID-19 isn’t helping at all. Am I expected to be normal during this time? I don’t know.

So I’m trying something else. How do I tell my mind that I don’t want to die? Like you know... lie to myself like how I’ve been trying to push through these past years. Maybe it’ll work... I don’t know yet. I do want to get better, but every time I have a depressive meltdown (as my boyfriend would call it), I recede back to step 1. And I’m just there in limbo, knowing full well that it will happen again. In months? Weeks? Days? Who knows, but it will happen again.

I hope everyone is at least doing somewhat better than I am."
depression,"I'm so starved for touch I'm so starved for human contact i physically ache

depression,"Am I depressed ? I always feel... blank just blank, I spend a lot of time in my bed or playing video games because when I do I feel like there's people like me. Internet help me not being sad. Sometimes, I steal something to eat in the kitchen because I'm sad and I need to eat. I think my parents are good parents but sometimes they make REALLY bad choices that drive me really sad and if I try to explain them their mistakes, they just tell me all my previous mistakes to make me shut up. My brother is always trying to drive me mad by messing with me. Usually I just go along with it but sometimes I just ""explode"" and let my anger do the job (we fight). My parents yell at me (it's 100% understable). Sometimes I do all the chores and everything so my parents are proud of me. They thank me but they don't remember the good things I do. Only the bad things.

depression,"What do I do, how do I operate normally and not resent my very existence. How do you go normally. How do you get up of a morning when you need to or remember to take medications. I can barely get up in time for work to not be late at all. I can barely get up at al on weekends and I can't keep myself going to sleep on a schedule. 

I keep missing out on my sertaline medication and I don't even really realise until I start getting withdrawal symptoms for lack of a better phrase. 

Some days I can go to work and take all the shit my coworkers give me and give it back and even deal with my boss when he goes all in on me. Some days I can't and I just can't function and somedays a switch will flick and I'll go from good to shit and than I'm stuck. I'll drive to work and try to work out which logging truck would be best to run my car under or which tree will be solid enough to kill me outright. Or I fantasise about how I could do it on my bike instead. 

I try and clean up by keep falling by the wayside and buy crap to eat when I get bad and that resent myself for it. Than I resent my physical appearance and weight as well as how much of a mess my room is. Thaj I get ashamed of things I've forgotten to do and hide them from people.

I'm desperate for some sort of close relationship but I can't see the point when I hate my own existence and can't stand my appearance. He'll I only hang out with at most 2 other people and neither of them are within 1000km of me. 

I can't even bring myself to game or read or listen to music sometimes and that's about all I live for because I don't have anything else to connect with.

Fuck3me I decided to try a fucking knife on myself as a punishment for fucking up yet again and making a mess and hiding shit because punching shit or myself isn't working and I don't have the discipline or respect to do it myself. It's all fucking stupid, my response to all this ""stimiuli"" is fucking stupid and poorly thought out and doesn't help me at all and I can recognise this and see it and I know its wrong but I can't help it which leads to me loathing myself because I can't stop the things I know are stupid and so I do more stupid stuff and start to loathemyself even more. I mean what the fuck 

What do I do, how do I do this. I can hardly function at the best of times and I gate it. I should hardly be complaining. I still have a job and I'm still employed. There's little to no virus deaths or infections. I have money. I have savings. I have a care and all the actually important shit to survive and no challenges presented to myself. Not really. And yet I still do this shit. I hate it. And yet I can't die, if I did im just putting more strain on more people, because here or not im still somebodies problem because I'm incapable of anything else. I hate it. I hate everything. I wish I could just delete my data entry, no more me no pain for anyone because I didn't exist. Life's a bitch when it's not computers

I kneed help. I don't know where to start. There's no support where I live readily available and where I work it's a 6 week wait for a counsellor and that wasn't great for me. What do I do"
depression,"Meaninglessness So I’m in my late 20s, recently found out I got accepted into two top MBA programs yet I’m just not excited about it at all. My boyfriend and I broke up last year.

depression,"My mum was a major causation of my depression and while I love and appreciate her for changing for me, I can't help but also feel like by doing this she is invalidating my depression. I had a toxic childhood growing up. Sometimes I would wake up at night time to my mum screaming because my dad was shoving her head down the toilet or sink. Other times my mum was constantly screaming at me for no good reason, throwing the few toys I had into the bin because it was 'crowding the house' or even pulling out a knife and threatening to kill my older sister - who although misbehaved, never deserved the sort of punishment she did. I would often jump in between them, screaming and crying and trying to pull my mum away - obviously looking back this was a dumb move but despite how crazy she got, I never believed she would intentionally hurt us. Just the idea of the knife was scary. She would beat us a lot too. My dad would only ever smack us and make us kneel down and face the wall as punishment. But my mum always took it the extra mile and hit us with a thin bamboo stick that left welts on us. I remember distinctly when I was 7 yo, my mum was hitting me because I was being difficult when she was putting on my winter school uniform. It was freezing cold and we didn't have a heater on, of course I acted the way I did. I had tried to grab onto the stick to stop her and instead it just made my hand bleed. I cried all the way to school and for the first and last time in my entire schooling life, she walked me up to the gate instead of just dropping me off at the carpark, apologising only once when I started to leave to go into school. That was the only time she ever apologised for beating me and even then it was such a round about way, basically saying 'I'm sorry you're bleeding, don't tell anyone at school what happened. Next time listen to me and I won't hit you'. That's just a glimpse of what I grew up with. Eventually fast forward to 2 years later and I began to display symptoms of depression - I was just always very angry, constantly threatening self harm and aggressive, - not afraid to get into physical fights with my sisters or my mum, but completely fine at school.  

During this time my mum had given birth to a daughter who had a wide age gap between herself and my sisters and I, and I couldn't help but be envious of the spoilt way my mother treated her and how she never got disciplined like we did. She grew up with a relatively normal childhood - sans minus seeing my violent and suicidal outbursts, which she eventually ended up rubbing off on me, saying she wanted to die about twice. But she was a toddler at this point so we ignored it as we thought responding to what she said would give weight and meaning to it and she stopped saying it just as immediately. I'm not sure if my mum even recognised I was depressed then (even I wasn't aware and assumed I was just a bad kid like my mum made me out to be) but eventually she found out when I was nearing the end of secondary schooling; when she had told her psychologist about my tendencies and he told her that I sounded depressed. I was diagnosed and only then did she begin to take my threats of suicide seriously and began to change how she treated my sisters and I.  She basically told me to f my final year of schooling, saying it didn't matter and I didn't have to push myself to get into a highly regarded degree etc. as she was always strict on my academics and this was another major reason I was depressed. I could see her making a visible effort to make sure I was happy - she reduced her screaming to a minimum, stopped kicking me out of the house, actually made me lunches for school and cooked me my favourite meals. She bought me a car when I got into university, the newest iphone, mac etc. And even as I'm writing this, I'm questioning if my childhood was ever as bad as it was - if my mind was blowing things out of proportion and making it worse than it really was. I know she's actively attempting to make up for the things she did that caused my depression and anxiety but I also hate it. I feel it invalidates my reason for being depressed and it's doing a hell of a good job convincing me that I'm just looking for self-pity, that she has already removed and fixed all reasons that could be causing my depression and for that my depression should be cured. I'm so confused by all this. I don't even know what my end goal is - what it is that I expect her to do to solve any of this."

I feel it invalidates my reason for being depressed and it's doing a hell of a good job convincing me that I'm just looking for self-pity, that she has already removed and fixed all reasons that could be causing my depression and for that my depression should be cured. I'm so confused by all this. I don't even know what my end goal is - what it is that I expect her to do to solve any of this."
depression,"People seemed to like my last post, so here is a uplifting poem this time. It's helped me through a lot so I thought I'd share it. if it helps one person, I'll be happy. I'm not lying to myself
On this hospital bed.
I've done alot of things, that I know I regret. 
Just wanna tell someone 
who cares.
but no one's here. 
Guess ill just write it instead. 
Out of fear. 
i might be dead soon,
here goes my last breath. 

Let the truth be heard. 
Do everything you want to, 
Just don't change for her. 
Know your worth. 
Don't ever tell yourself, 
That you don't deserve, 
to be on this earth. 
Put your mental health first. 
try Live everyday, with a smile on your face. 
And if you can't seem to take it 
just know that,
Thats okay. 
I'm not saying I relate
to all your bad days.
But sometimes life sucks
And i really fucking hate it. 
Im not saying we're the same.
I'm just saying, it's okay 
To feel this way..
Just know, 
Tomorrow's a new day,
And no days the same. 
Maybe tomorrow wont be hazy.
Maybe it will be amazing. 
no one knows, 
I'm just saying. 

Hang in there. 
weather changes. 


I know it's so cliche and repetitive but it's true, weathers gonna change but stick to being you."
depression,"Too deep in depression I'm a university student on the imminent verge of failing.

I had a very rough childhood, being raised abused physically but especially psychologically, not gonna get into detail, but I'd like to think that I am not as fucked up as I should've been.

I can't recall the last time I was truly happy and I don't think I could because I don't think I know the definition of happiness. I used to be sad most of my life but for the past few years I have felt mostly nothing, just emptiness. No emotion, just hollowness. 

I still feel guilty for not being sad or crying when my grandma died a few years ago. She was an important part of my life, but yet I couldn't feel anything, and I still don't.

For a very short time in my life I considered suicide as an option, but I somehow managed to get out of it because that would pass my burden on my family.

It seems to me that I just can't be happy or sad, but just emptiness. I miss feeling alive."
depression,"What reasons are you feeling depressed? I feel like are multiple reasons why someone could slip into depression, what is yours?"
depression,"Is it getting worse or better? I thought I was getting better. I now have a girlfriend who I love deeply, great friends, and I am getting into my hobbies again (though I don't really enjoy them as much), I even tried to stop being so rude to people. I remember being angry, tired and miserable when I was at my worst depressive state, now I just feel empty.
It's a familiar feeling as before, but I think it's worse somehow. I have my casual panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, but instead of being worried or argered about them, I just don't care, they're normal at this point and it's not like I can do anything to help it. I think this is good, because if I don't care about my mental health I will have less shit to worry about, but at the same time it might get worse without I even noticing.
This doesn't make any sense, sorry.

This might be because of quarantine and how I have to be with my parents all the time. I feel like they make everything worse, but maybe I'm just a self centered asshole."
depression,"I want to kill myself, but I’m too scared it will go wrong I’m 16, a disappointment to myself and my family. I know, that yeah, I have years ahead of me, but all these feelings of numbness and emptiness just don’t make it worth the ride. I keep on imagining how I’m going to do it, but I don’t have somewhere to hang myself, I can’t bear the thought of slitting my wrists and i can’t get any substantial drugs to overdose on (I routinely gobble paracetamol, but it just leaves me with a fucked up stomach). I don’t know what to do."
depression,"Anyone with additional diagnosis along side depression? I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a few months ago. I knew something was wrong when I'd have repeated cycles of extreme mental anguish, probably 50x worse than I would normally feel with depression/anxiety. I would be my normal depressed self one week and the following few days I'd feel soooo bad. One thing that sucks about this is whenever something happens I over think, over think, over think. Doing this makes me feel exhausted and has had an impact on my relationships with friends and family members. I always have the assumption that they aren't in my best interest. I can be so forgetful. My mind stays awake like music playing or loud noises even though its quiet. I'm crying a lot especially since I stopped taking an ssri that made me completely numb. I stopped talking to my friends because I always felt abnormal compared to them, we just didn't mix well."
depression,I'm such a fucking idiot. I wish i had the guts to just kill myself. Nobody is better off for knowing me. they would be sad for a few weeks and then they would get over it. I'm just too much of a coward to do what i know is best for everyone. I can't stop thinking about it.
depression,"20,M. My “best years” are being wasted and I blame my depression but at the same time I don’t see myself changing Whenever I speak to poeple, I hear all these plans they make and I just die inside.

Why me"
depression,"I want to die I just want to die, I dont even want to talk anymore, I just want to feel the warmth of a bullet going through  my head"
depression,"Can someone please just reassure me that it'll be OK? I'm 15. A British girl with good grades. Don't get bullied, not been through trauma, have a roof over my head, a family that loves me. My death date is 13/5/20. Tomorrow. Friday I was admitted to hospital because of suicidal thoughts. I stayed until Monday where therapists sent me home because I didn't say that I had the intention of hurting myself when I got home. I didn't when talking to them but I said the thoughts were getting stronger again. They told me to see how things went. Today I talked to this other person over the phone who I normally talk to who I like talking to. He stayed extra late so we could get to chat at A&amp;E. I thought he did it out of kindness but when we talked over the phone today I said thanks, he basically said he wouldn't have stayed if he wasn't getting payed for it. There's little things in life that keep me going, talking to certain people, groups, songs. And slowly those things are just leaving. It makes me realise that people don't really care about you. Infact they don't give a fuck. My family have become so loving because they know I'm Suicidal. I abandoned my friends months ago and they gave up on me too. Therapist don't care, I'm just a name on a piece of paper. I feel so alone. So completely alone. And I know I'm not physically alone but mentally I do. I was terrified of going home from hospital and I knew it was the wrong decision but I went along with it. I knew I couldn't stay forever and the longer I'd stay, the harder it's be to leave. They are looking to put me on antidepressants and the only thing I can think that would be useful about them is taking too many. I know. Roll your eyes, another fucking sad story about someone who should be happy feeling sorry for themselves. I never feel sorry for myself, I'm always trying to keep everyone but myself happy so just hold your judgement. I'm just so tired. Too tired now. It's just all too much. School is reducing my work load and my family treat me like I'm broken or that I might break it they don't shower me with cakes and compliments. I regret getting help. I wish I'd gone through with it on Friday. Saturday was worse than Friday and Sunday I felt nothing. Monday was where the thoughts started to erupt again, as I was telling the counsellors everything. Today I woke up feeling pretty crap. Your probably asking why tomorrow I'll die. Maybe I'll not be able to wait until then but tomorrow I have another doctors appointment where they'll be giving me my plan for the future - therapy, whether or not I'll be on meds. I'm also speaking to the therapist that stayed on Friday and that I spoke to today to update him on what's happening tomorrow over the phone again. Maybe he'll be able to persuade me out of things but I don't know. It's selfish isn't it? Stringing people along? Giving them false hope that I'm able to and want to get better. It's just all too much. Can someone please just reassure me it'll be OK? Because I can't convince myself. I feel so dead inside, like the person I was died months ago and now I'm just the shell of a person. Death will bring me peace so death is what I'll do."
depression,Tired I remember what it feels like to be happy and to actually look forward to the next day.  Its been a couple months now. It seems to come for a few weeks then leave for months. It always comes back though. No matter what I always seem to hit rock bottom and end up alone. I feel no one really cares about me. I never get asked how i'm doing but if someone is going through something im expected to be there. Always about them and not me. All my so called do me wrong over and over but i just forgive and forget because im used to it by now. I'm tired of it.
depression,"Corona has ruined everything I’m almost positive I’ve lost my job. 
I have no income coming in.
I’m stuck in the house with my family.
I’ve gained weight again after nearly a month of consistently losing.
Friends don’t talk to me.

I’m in a hole with smooth walks. I can’t get out. I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want to think anymore. It’s too much."
