    "\n",
    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "\n",
    "In 2019, more than 1.72 million graduates (estimated 52% of the US high school graduands) sat for the ACT. This is a slight drop from the 1.9 million ACT candidates (or estimated 55% of the graduating batch) reported in 2018. Meanwhile, over 2.2 million graduates sat for the SAT, with a 4% increase from the previous year. Evidence here suggests that the ACT is becoming less popular over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications to sit the ACT and SAT cost a considerable sum respectively. Self-sponsored ACT candidates pay `$63` to sit for the exams, and an additional `$25` to be tested on an optional Writing component. On the other hand, self-sponsored SAT candidates pay `$60` to sit for the exams <a href=\"https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-vs-sat\" target=\"_blank\">(source)</a>.\n",
    "\n",

    "Fortunately, 16 states allow students to sit for the ACT exams at no charge, while 11 states offer students to sit for the SAT at no charge. <a href=\"https://www.collegeraptor.com/getting-in/articles/act-sat/states-act-sat-given-free/\" target=\"_blank\">(source)</a>. It should be noted that only Colorado offers its students to sit for both sets of exams for free. In addition, students who reside in states that are on neither of the aforementioned lists may apply for fee waivers on the condition that they meet some requirements.\n",
